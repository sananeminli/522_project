grubhub,302920553,2022-10-06 18:04:56,Drivers are doing too much,"1. I‚Äôve been waiting for an hour so far for my lunch. An hour after the delivery time which already was an hour! 2 hrs! The driver made at least FIVE other deliveries and she‚Äôs not done yet. I‚Äôm not paying extra per order to have my meal come straight to me. She was at the restaurant quickly to pick my food up but then delivered to so many others!
2. This is not the drivers fault. If they agree to accept every delivery then it is what it is. It‚Äôs hit or miss if your food will be 20 mins or 2 hours. For as much as you pay per order so everyone profits, it‚Äôs not worth waiting so long for the order. And guaranteed it‚Äôll be nice and cold. üò† or something will be missing. Refunding my money doesn‚Äôt make my food good or help with a missing item. I‚Äôve had to reorder from places to make sure I actually get what is correct. Anyone else have picky kids?? You can‚Äôt even eat and enjoy food when your child‚Äôs doesn‚Äôt come or has crap on it that you didn‚Äôt order!!
3. The area to leave directions to the house is way too small. My neighbors are getting angry that cars are always at their house and I‚Äôm getting annoyed trying to reduce the directions down to. 250 characters. So if it‚Äôs not clear, the drivers get confused and my neighbors and I are annoyed. Whose fault?? FIX IT.",3
grubhub,302920553,2022-11-06 07:44:28,Will block you for anything,"They blocked my account in sept I have followed the email steps and still have not yet received any response. They will block you for any little thing especially when some things are out of your control. For example I will have two deliveries my first delivery pick up would be my last drop off. The time stamp would be to drop my second delivery off first at 3:38 but my first delivery time stamp would be 3:36 how is that even possible ? I had NUMEROUS deliveries like this one. They will constantly send me alerts about delivering orders late, but how when this is what the apps/system suggests me to do. I‚Äôm only following what‚Äôs giving to me. Also you would get a delivery request but the restaurant would just be getting it when you arrive and you‚Äôll have to wait for the order to be done. I put in the app ‚Äúorder not started until I arrived ‚Äú you would think they will adjust your time stamp to deliver. You can‚Äôt put a time on how fast food is prepared. A lot of things needs to be updated so future drivers like myself won‚Äôt have such a headache when trying to make a living. I started this in July and I‚Äôm already blocked in September and as of currently still no response or update regarding my account. You guys should get customer service employee‚Äôs to help with blocked accounts instead of having drivers waiting and responding to emails that never receive a reply!",1
grubhub,302920553,2022-09-26 16:54:30,Used to love GrubHub until I was hacked,"I‚Äôve used GrubHub for years and thought it was great! Unfortunately, my account got hacked and someone used my account to order $40 worth of food and then changed the email on the account so they could change the password. As soon as I noticed the charges and reported it to Customer Care, I got an email saying they moved my inquiry to ‚Äúpriority‚Äù due to the serious nature of the concern and that they would be in contact with me shortly. The email also suggested I reset my password if possible, but I can‚Äôt since the hacker changed my account info. Days go by and nothing. I sent an email on the same thread asking for an update and a refund and still nothing. It‚Äôs been about 2 weeks and I still have not received a response. I was able to remove my payment from my account, luckily, but now I still can‚Äôt use my account because of the account log in change.

EDIT:
The same day I posted this review, GrubHub got back to me and sent me a refund and helped solve my issue so I adjusted my rating. I do think that serious matters like this should be handled quicker, but do appreciate them handling the situation in a fair manner.",4
grubhub,302920553,2022-09-26 20:18:27,"So far, so Good!","Today is Monday, September 26, 2022, and this is the second time that I have had an issue with GrubHub delivery. I‚Äôve been tracking this driver and he or she has been driving around in my neighborhood and didn‚Äôt even bother to  get to my address so therefore I felt that my food would‚Äôve  been cold upon arrival and now it was abruptly cancelled, so now I am re-ordering once  again.üò° I am a senior citizen and I am disabled, the name of the complex is Mayflower Gardens Senior Apartments. I wished that the driver would keep in mind that some of us older customers are not as quick to get to the door and we are not dumb or stupid. I know know how to read apps, and I know my directions,when they come, and some of them in the past will abruptly leave your order at the door on the ground and not even bother to knock. I am requesting a re-order once again because I have tracked the last driver and he or she was in my neighborhood and I‚Äôm not sure if they were lost or not but it would be nice if they were use the GPS system more effectively so that they can find my address. Please know that  is why I am really hesitant to order with you in the near future if this continues to happen. Needless to say I am not happy at this time.I noticed that a female driver will be delivering my order shortly and I hope that it‚Äôll arrive in time.",1
grubhub,302920553,2022-11-01 20:34:29,Ugh,"This company is one of the worst I‚Äôve ever dealt with.  Late all the time. Often the math doesn‚Äôt add up.  They gave me a $5 promo for being late but it only gave me $1 and change off.  Sketchy.   The order will come to one thing but they charge the bank another.  I canceled last yr but ended up with a free year long plus membership then I got hurt so can‚Äôt drive so I use it a lot now.  It‚Äôs rare I have a seamless order.  Just now I‚Äôm waiting for my food for an hr get a call from a man I couldn‚Äôt understand and he just hangs up on me when I said sorry I didn‚Äôt catch that.  Very thick accent in a very loud call center.   Then I see my order was canceled I had promos on the order from the last time they messed up and now those aren‚Äôt valid.  I reordered from another restaurant and the driver didn‚Äôt bring the drinks,  give us forks or sauce.  Also knocked when I said to no contact.  I had one driver last year flip off my camera for absolutely no reason. I tip 25%.   I definitely won‚Äôt be using it after my free year ends this February.  I was formally a paid Grubhub + customer.  I order out probably 15 to 20 times a month due to my physical pain.  It‚Äôs easier than cooking and cleaning dishes.   But I‚Äôll  find other ways like pizza delivery or DoorDash. Which isn‚Äôt much better but still better.",1
grubhub,302920553,2022-11-06 22:35:01,Was not able to place an order,"I don‚Äôt use Grubhub much but when I do use it, it‚Äôs always a problem placing an order. I spent over an hour trying to place an order and my order kept being cancelled for no reason. I tried different restaurants, different payment cards, tried the app and internet browser but no luck. The generic and un useful message I would get would be ‚ÄúReason for cancellation: Unfortunately, we're unable to fulfill this order‚Äù and that‚Äôs all. Another brief message I would get is to call customer service if the problem continues but could not find a customer service number anywhere. I finally found the customer service number by reading the reviews, I called and the customer service person working from home had a rooster that can be heard in the background. The rep did not offer any troubleshooting and or solution to get my order, only said he would escalated to a supervisor and it can take up to 24hrs for them to get back to me or resolve it. ??? The only solution I given to me was that I can go in person to the restaurant or call them directly. I wanted the convenience of not going out and having my food delivered but it turned into a mission. I used a different app and I was able to place an order without any problems.",1
grubhub,302920553,2022-12-02 03:33:20,Would give a zero if I could!,"Terrible service, terrible customer service. Order from restaurant website it defaulted to grub hub for delivery. I ordered and received a time range for delivery of 6:35-6:45 pm. Order did not arrive until 8:03pm. Food was worse than cold. The app showed driver 45 min away enroute to order. Then showed driver in another parking lot down the road hovering forever. I messaged driver he said he was ‚Äúwaiting‚Äù. I called restaurant my order was ready. No one was there waiting to pick up. Asked if I could get my food remade as it was ready for quite some time but I would have to reorder and repurchase. Tried to cancel through grub hub. Could never get through. The queue had over 300 people in it. Called driver he was picking up order but had to wait for another persons and couldn‚Äôt leave until theirs was done. Took him 30 min to get 5 miles down the road the app showed him lost and hovering in random parts of our neighborhood. Food received was cold and soggy. Contacted customer service chat they adjusted the wrong item to refund for $3+. I asked for a full refund. Sent me to a different chat with 100+ in queue just to delete me out of chat completely. Will never use Grub hub again. Door Dash is much more efficient and has better help and customer service.",1
grubhub,302920553,2022-09-20 03:35:53,Grub Hub is not 24/7,"I ordered Wendy‚Äôs one night at around 10:00 - 10:15, and they had to delay my order for about 30 minutes, which i get, stuff happens ya know it can‚Äôt always be perfect. And then I get another delay, and then another, next thing I know my order is not going to arrive until an hour and a half past when it was originally going to arrive. I noticed that when I went to the Home Screen where all the restaurants are, they had all closed. When I searched places such as insomnia cookie, which stays open very late, it said they were still open but it wasn‚Äôt appearing on the Home Screen. This meant there were no delivery drivers to actually deliver my order now and Grubhub does not know how to handle this when it happens. I contacted support and was told my order could not be cancelled but could instead receive a 10% discount . . . Woo. I attempted to contact support multiple times after but for some reason it would not reconnect me to anyone else, I did get reconnected to one person, however they said nothing the entire time, and after sitting in the call for about 5 minutes with no response, I left. This is definitely up there with some of the worst experiences I‚Äôve had with delivery services, I was honestly kinda impressed.",1
grubhub,302920553,2022-09-28 01:20:41,Worst Food Delivery App,"Time and time again GrubHub disappoints me. I order food, leave clear written instructions about where I live and never select ‚ÄúContact free delivery‚Äù because I know the app is going to navigate the driver somewhere else. Why?! I have no idea!! There are a select few drivers who go above and beyond. If they can‚Äôt find my residence, they call me, ask questions and eventually deliver my food. I always tip the drivers because I appreciate them delivering my food. However, there are some drivers who don‚Äôt even attempt to deliver my food, don‚Äôt go above and beyond to make sure I get what I ordered and are either rude or don‚Äôt answer my calls/texts after they‚Äôve dropped off my food at the door but it‚Äôs nowhere to be found. It is a waste of time, money and food ordering through GrubHub. Yes, my money gets refunded when I contact customer support. What I‚Äôd like to know is why don‚Äôt they update their apps navigation to prevent the drivers from not being able to find the home? Why don‚Äôt the drivers go out of their way to contact the customer? Why don‚Äôt the drivers respond to texts or calls? It‚Äôs beyond aggravating going through this time and time again. I‚Äôm deleting this and going to use Uber Eats or Door Dash instead.",1
grubhub,302920553,2022-09-12 02:06:49,Money back true but‚Ä¶,"I agree with the reviewer who said that customer service only response is to refund your $ but not to make it right.
 In this post Covid job apocalypseIt would be better if a company with his big name in food delivery as GrubHub, would value their drivers and delivery people a little higher and give them credit for doing the job that they are doing. I wouldn‚Äôt do the job myself but I‚Äôm glad there are people who do since I am a handicap shut in.
But I‚Äôve struggled with Walmart over almost 3 months to get them to honor the price quoted by one of their vendors. Apparently there are no companies anymore who value and honor their employees. The bigger they are the less they care.  
I wish there were someone out there who would create a delivery service where the money went all to the restaurant and  drivers and all the service did was broker their services.
Alas we do not live in that world. For whatever it‚Äôs worth GrubHub seems to serve things up just as well as any other delivery service I had to use.",4
grubhub,302920553,2022-09-21 02:43:15,Horrible customer service,"I received a text saying my order was delivered by the front door. I went outside. It wasn‚Äôt there. I texted the driver asking him where he left it. He says under the mailbox which didn‚Äôt make much sense given where the mailroom is in my building. I then described my building and asked him if that‚Äôs where he left it. He texts back no. I asked him what address he left it at. He texts back that he doesn‚Äôt have that information, and there‚Äôs nothing else he can do to help me. I went to the app and tried to use the chat to talk to customer service. I was in a queue for a while. Then someone finally joined the chat. They didn‚Äôt type anything or respond to anything. After 10 minutes of no response in the chat, I found the customer service number and called them. After a bit of time on hold, I finally talked to someone and explained what happened. She said she would reorder it for me but didn‚Äôt offer any discount or coupon or anything. She didn‚Äôt even really apologize. I finally received my order over an hour late. No discount, no coupon, no apology, nothing!",2
grubhub,302920553,2022-11-12 01:10:08,Unwilling Drivers to Find my House,"I had 2 experiences where the driver couldn‚Äôt find my house. Poor directions from Grubhub. I live on a busy street, right across from a high school, with a unique tower above the garage and the drivers still couldn‚Äôt find it! I even had one delivery person leave my order at the wrong house and do nothing. Sometimes I don‚Äôt have a car and so ordering my food to be delivered is the only way I can get it. I have never had this problem with Doordash or Instacart. I only started with Grubhub because of a promotion from my work.  I decided to cancel my $10 a month membership, after one of the drivers, who drove past my house twice, even with me telling him the directions very politely at the same time, threaten to drive off with my order and not deliver it. He then refused to drive into my driveway and had me run out to his truck to grab it. Once I did, I said ‚ÄúThank you!‚Äù And he said said uh-huh and drove off. I get it, he took longer to find my house, but I did tip 20%. I should not have been treated like that. I do work customer service and I do know how hard it can be, but in this case, how I was treated, was unacceptable.",1
grubhub,302920553,2022-12-18 07:26:03,Your negligence ruined my 30th birthday dinner,"I ordered from Tucanos for my 30th birthday dinner. It was set to arrive at around 5:40, perfect for dinner time. About 5:30 the driver called to tell me Tucanos doesn‚Äôt sell the thing I ordered. When I asked her to ask them for a substitution, they said THEY AREN‚ÄôT SELLING ANY TAKEOUT ORDERS THIS MONTH. By the time I could order something else from DoorDash and have it arrive, I was eating dinner at 7 while my kids were getting ready for bed, they having had grilled cheeses. You have ONE job, Grubhub App. Confirm the order so the driver can pick it up. Clearly Tucanos didn‚Äôt confirm they could fill the order before you wasted my time and the driver‚Äôs time on the order. I hope you paid her. Your process requires revision. You know what‚Äôs worse than having to go get your own food because a restaurant won‚Äôt do delivery? HAVING NO FOOD BECAUSE YOUR APP DROPPED THE BALL! I hope you fail by losing your customer base to Doordash‚Äôs superior app and process design. 

UPDATE: Developer has responded to my complaint by asking me to use their ‚Äúcontact us‚Äù option on their site. There is not actually a way to contact them at the link provided.",1
grubhub,302920553,2022-11-13 18:11:42,Food is always late,"I‚Äôm done with GrubHub after this order. Every delivery is late. The restaurant‚Äôs provide the correct items, but we always end up staring at our drivers on the map going to the restaurant then driving to the other end of the city, before updating to say the order will be late and they‚Äôve magically just picked up our food and are on the way. After complaining to GrubHub twice recently about cold food, both times they said they would issue a $5 make-good and neither time has that email been received. I always tip over 20% for the drivers, but then end up with cold food. I wish there was the ability to tip after delivery rather than before. I also wish there was a way to ensure deliveries came straight from the restaurant to our door rather than being the third stop on the way 45 mins after the food leaves the restaurant. I understand we‚Äôre paying for convenience of not leaving our house, but the markups on all the food is ridiculous. You‚Äôre basically paying three times the cost for poor quality.",2
grubhub,302920553,2022-12-10 22:31:00,Grubhub Meal Delivery Service,"I‚Äôve never used meal delivery services that require a membership to be more affordable. But not having to leave my house to shop for groceries and then spend time and effort making meals has been surprisingly rewarding!

Grubhub has changed the way I feel about ‚Äúbeing too lazy‚Äù to do it myself, because the convenience is a justified reward for worn out full time parents, the elderly and disabled people. 

Ordering is SO easy, from a growing number of participating top fast food, healthy and top-notch restaurants. It IS a little pricier but the minimal extra cost is WELL WORTH IT! Average time from submitting an order to delivery at your door is about 20-35 minutes, or 40-50 during holiday seasons. And everything is hot, fresh and ready to serve. 

I‚Äôve been happy with this app‚Äôs service, overall   However I do have occasional issues, especially within the last 3 months or so:  
1.  Orders that display a status of ‚Äúbeing prepared‚Äù or ‚Äúon the way‚Äù but are suddenly cancelled without explanation or notification. 
2.  Orders that indicate delivery completed, but never received. These are always cases where they delivered to the wrong address. 
3. And lastly, orders that are missing items, especially the drinks. 

I still recommend this app and I still use it often but I want people to be aware that the service is not without occasional delays, problems or issues. 

Ren√©e W.

grubhub,302920553,2022-10-06 22:57:25,Horrible Customer Service,"I have had to deal with their customer service several times. They have all been horrible experiences. There is no empathy to anyones situation and their solutions are laughable. Tonight we placed an order and 10 minutes later I got a notification that it was cancelled and then a phone call letting me know my order was cancelled due to a restaurant error and I would get a refund within 5 days. We made other plans for dinner and we‚Äôre sitting down to eat 40 minutes later when my phone rang and it was the restaurant that we originally ordered from asking if we were coming to pick up the order. I guess Grubhub cancelled it on their own without telling the restaurant. I apologized as if I knew, I would have gone over and picked it up myself. I went and read the email Grubhub sent and they stated it was a delivery error, but customer service blamed it on the restaurant. This is horrible for both the consumer and the restaurant that lost the money for food they prepared. We‚Äôve had so many issues, but I won‚Äôt be wasting money on this anymore.",1
grubhub,302920553,2022-10-30 18:51:05,Horrible!,"Horrible system just like Seamless. Do not follow there guarantee policy to cancel order if the order has not been confirmed yet. I‚Äôve had problems with drivers eating my food, delivering to the wrong location, not reading my directions, restaurants not following my specifications so because of that Grubhub and Seamless have dubbed my account suspicious of getting large amount of concessions so this would be a reason to not be able to follow there guarantee of canceling an order if you use the wrong credit card. They blame me not the drivers they hire or the restaurant that made the mistake or the fact that on multiple occasions I have lost my lunch hour due to there incompetence of not following directions or putting ingredients in my food that I am unable to eat or the restaurant is about 3 hours late delivering my food so they have a guarantee and I collect on that guarantee so if you do then your suspicious. I believe this company is run by a bunch of idiots. Here‚Äôs all these guarantees we offer but please do use the chat and collect on them!",1
grubhub,302920553,2022-09-11 21:06:28,Worst Delivery Service in KC,"I have had multiple times where a restaurant and/dasher calls because the order does not exist in their system or someone has given the wrong CC information. Grubhub jacks up the prices then processes your card meanwhile someone calls the restaurant and uses a company CC. I had a restaurant call me one time and said they wouldn‚Äôt let my food go because my CC was declined‚Ä¶they then told me how it Grubhub calls them and pays with a different card. I gave the restaurant another CC and my food was delivered. Meanwhile, Grubhub said my card was already processed and couldn‚Äôt cancel the charge or do anything‚Ä¶until I told them what that the restaurant already told me that Grubhub personal gave them their CC that was declined then all of a sudden I had an instant refund. The same thing just happened again but worse. This company is nothing but robbing you. And what about the ‚Äúfree memberships‚Äù with other apps? Are they really free if I‚Äôm charged hella dollars for a service fee every order AND jacked up prices. No it‚Äôs not free, just a scam!",1
grubhub,302920553,2022-11-10 02:58:16,First and last time I will use this service,"Placed my order and I could see tracking of driver picking up food. Then all of a sudden the driver is switched to a different person who then drives to the same location to pick up my food. After a confirmation of my food being picked up and the driver coming all the way to my hotel parking lot, calls me to question if I picked up my food already. I have been waiting over an hour (order was delayed due to the driver switch) just to then be accused that I picked up my own food?! So after waiting all that time, and then driving to my location to finally inform me my order was ‚Äúlost.‚Äù  I then get in touch with customer support who informs me it will take up to 5 days to be refunded and that my order could not be created as the place wouldn‚Äôt be able to make it  in time so then I had to figure out a different delivery as I was not going to risk my food being ‚Äúlost‚Äù again through this terrible service. Never using Grubhub again. Worst first experience.",1
grubhub,302920553,2022-12-18 02:04:57,Horrible customer service,I‚Äôve never had a good experience with this service and it‚Äôs always been the drivers fault but today takes the cake. Today we ordered and the order was delayed once which was expected due to how popular the restaurant is but then the order was picked up and then the driver took almost an hour to deliver the food at one point I kept track of his location and it remained stationary in the same spot for over 10 minutes when attempting to contact the driver there was no answer on his behalf. After going to grub hub to report this all they could say was sorry for the service and for the cold food here‚Äôs 5 dollar credit that expires in 30 days when asking if anything else could be done they said they can‚Äôt do anything regarding their drivers. There‚Äôs a lack of accountability with their drivers why wouldn‚Äôt they be able to cover for them it‚Äôs their employees not the restaurant‚Äôs fault. I have now deleted the app and account and now they have lost a user.,1
grubhub,302920553,2022-11-19 19:43:40,"Driver stole our food, customer service couldn‚Äôt reorder","We ordered lunch at 10:30 with an 11:15 expected delivery. Around 11:35 we start wondering where our food is. No correspondence from our driver. I look on the app and it says our food has been delivered. We check all door locations- no food. Start chatting with customer service and they won‚Äôt give the drivers number or any form of communication. They say the driver is no longer responding and that they cannot reprocess our order. By this time it is noon and to reorder, there is a 50-60 minute wait. We ordered $90 worth of food which they said they would refund within 3-5 days and offered a $10 coupon. So by 12:30, we have no food, we have an hour wait for anything else and we have a $10 reward to a company that clearly does not vet their drivers. I‚Äôm sorry but $10 is not enough to make up for the severe inconvenience and lack of ability to make it right in a timely manner. Will definitely be using different apps from here on out.",1
grubhub,302920553,2022-11-01 14:01:24,Worst Food Delivery App,I absolutely hate this food app. I will never use again. I actually get free delivery with prime but I won‚Äôt be ordering through them again. Everytime I order from them my order is either canceled or a couple times it‚Äôs extremely late. One time I waited over 2 hours for a burrito from a place 10 min away. I kept talking to customer service and they would not tell me if it was something with the restaurant or was it just that the driver was not going to pick it up from the place. Eventually after talking to about 3 customer service reps I canceled the order and went to get it myself. They also didn‚Äôt want to give me a full refund for waiting over 2 hours when estimated delivery was 30 min. A few other times my order was delivered in the dirt outside my apartment complex. Just left there. GrubHub did nothing for me. Even after sending pics and messages. They need serious work on customer service and driver issues before I will ever use them again.,1
grubhub,302920553,2022-11-17 07:41:50,Edited delivery address ended up paying for multiple orders,"App Problem #1 was that the app showed wrong delivery address type (home/business). The app makes it possible to edit the delivery address info. So I did. Bu the address type showing wrong type did not get fixed. I tried again and then gave up. 

App Problem #2 was that every address edit was interpreted as a new order. So got charged for 2 more orders. 

Restaurant Problem #1 was that they did not answer my call.

Restaurant Problem #2 was that even though I texted them them that I have been trying to change my address they still sent me extra meals of the same exact order. 

Restaurant Problem #3 was that they ignored the fact that they received 3 exactly the same orders from the same person to the same delivery location within 2 minutes or so.

Grubhub Support Problem #1 is that they are bot customer satisfaction oriented. They don‚Äôt have this predefined business instinct or making it right for the customer. They made me explicitly ask for a refund and then repeat my request. And then they wanted to refund only 1 extra order. I had to really insist for them to finally cancel those orders and issue the refund.  Haven‚Äôt received the refund yet. Writing right after my interaction with the support.",3
grubhub,302920553,2022-11-16 02:05:50,The worst customer service!,"The app is what it is a food ordering service.  What do you expect to receive from a company that adversities ‚Äúcustomer service‚Äù?  Well for me expect that I would order the desired product and that the order would be delivered as expected in a fair time.  I order the wait was almost an hour but okay I agreed to the price and the time.  Pay the fees and tip 20% of the ticket to the driver.   I called the restaurant after the time had passed 3 minutes from latest delivery expectation.  The restaurant informed me the food had been waiting on a driver for almost 16 minutes.  I started a text with grub hub and all I got was a cancelled order, five dollar off my next sixty dollar order and a I really apologize for this.  This is not the first time it has happened!  Just a word and maybe it is just my bad luck with these guys but I will not waste another 1hour of my life to cancel the order and get an apology.  I hate this app, and the customer service which is not!",1
grubhub,302920553,2022-10-15 16:43:58,Wrong order received,"Where is the accountability from Grubhub when mistakes are made?  You delivered the wrong order to my home this morning.  I call you and tell you what happened and you tell me you‚Äôve refunded the order and that‚Äôs all you can do.  We call the restaurant and our order is just sitting there. I ask why you can‚Äôt deliver my order?  Customer service says once the order has been marked as delivered there is nothing they can do. Absolute trash of a service you provide Grubhub.   Make the order right, send the driver to go back and pick up my correct order??  I didn‚Äôt call you for funsies, your job was to deliver to my food and a mistake was made.  Why is Grubhub not able to make good on their end??  Last time we use your service Grubhub.  Corporate pigs at their finest.  Talked to customer service and waited for over an hour after our wrong order was delivered to finally get someone on the phone who also wouldn‚Äôt accept any accountability.",1
grubhub,302920553,2022-11-04 22:13:59,Worse than Doordash,"So just had a conversation with customer support, I was waiting for my order and it said it would arrive at x time, so I waited and noticed that the driver was at one point just driving in circles near but about 5 blocks from my location, so I thought ok here we go again gps is going to screw things up, I message the driver no response, I call the driver still no response. Now I‚Äôm worried so I contact grub hub customer service and ask them to check up on the driver because I‚Äôm think maybe they got into an accident or something they are in the middle of the street and haven‚Äôt moved their gps location in about 10 mins. Well it turns out the gps was just freaking out and the driver was picking up an order for someone else and was waiting for almost 30 mins to pick it up when they could have delivered my food and then gone back.  I‚Äôm sorry but what kind of backwards algorithm are you folks in grub hub using to determine deliveries.",1
grubhub,302920553,2022-10-21 22:55:52,They know what they‚Äôre doing to hide bad reviews,"Not only is Apple somehow changing 1-star reviews to 5-star for this app, but in the app you can‚Äôt even review a restaurant or driver once you have a problem. Driver never delivered your food? Can‚Äôt leave a review to warn others. Restaurant forgot half your meal? Once you file for a refund you can‚Äôt leave a review. Forcing only positive feedback to make themselves and bad restaurants look good. I just ordered food and you can tell the restaurant intentionally ‚Äúforgot‚Äù all of the free items like sauce and utensils, as well as more than half my food. They only refunded me $11 so I ended up paying $32 for $7 worth of food. I don‚Äôt know who is worse, Grubhub or DoorDash. I‚Äôve also had MULTIPLE drivers just disappear for 45 minutes. Literally happened to me THREE times where I‚Äôve cancelled orders because of a driver who probably went home. Just pick up your own food folks. Or use local delivery services. Forget about these garbage corporations.",1
grubhub,302920553,2022-10-11 11:26:27,Meh,"Tried it out for the first time using a gift card. Ordered from a place we typically love. It was very easy. Driver was awesome we tipped well.  However, GrubHub managed a huge markup on everything in addition to multiple fees etc.  After everything, it almost doubled the price of our normal order. We would be crazy to use GrubHub unless it‚Äôs an emergency.  

Also, the app suggested to us to add-on drinks at 7-11 on the way. I tried to add drinks onto the order but it seemed to be missing beer from the app. Just suggested pop and energy drinks. No thank you.  

I‚Äôll just be picking up myself in the future.  Maybe I will try that next time‚Ä¶ assuming there aren‚Äôt tons of fees/markup.  I didn‚Äôt know it was an option but I just Googled it and found this is offered.  Honestly, would rather call the restaurant and order direct to support their business.",3
grubhub,302920553,2022-11-15 00:53:19,Worst Delivery Service EVER!!,"I order mcdonalds‚Ä¶. Got a combo, and an extra cheeseburger on the side. Came out to $20 i believe. Im checking the map because my food is taking wayyy too long. The driver isnt even NEAR the restaurant. It says ‚Äúon the way to you‚Äù yet he‚Äôs driving the opposite direction.   The receipt says my food was finished at 3:22pm,yet i received it at 3:56pm.  My food was COLD. Unedible, And my cheeseburger was made incorrectly. Ticket said NO PICKLES EXTRA ONIONS, Yet i received no onions extra pickles‚Ä¶ (which is the restaurants fault not grubhub)  so anyways i contact ‚Äòsupport‚Äô and told them my entire order was wrong. Even received dr pepper instead of coke. Literally my WHOLE ORDER was poor quality. They gove me a $4.77 refund for EVERYTHING. Literally stealing money from customers at this point just so your weak employees can cruise around town, then deliver incorrect, COLD food. Will not be using this app ever again, and will definitely be advising others to not use this poor excuse of delivery services.",1
grubhub,302920553,2022-11-03 23:11:59,Grubhub is Awesome!,"I pick up my own orders when I can, but when I am starving and don‚Äôt feel like going; Grubhub is awesome! The restaurant‚Äôs I order from are delicious and the drivers are excellent. I get my orders in a timely manner and the food is hot and the drinks are cold - winter and summer! So treat yourself! I first used Grubhub last holiday season! No traffic headaches and timely service! Holiday testing is a good measure for service. These folks have never let me down!  Steak Out has actually hung up on me when I called during the week. Not just once or twice - consistently. The weekend crew is great. However, Grubhub has never disappointed me no matter what day it is! Steak Out just loses my business on hang up days! And Grubhub comes through!!!",5
grubhub,302920553,2022-11-03 20:19:48,Just terrible overall,I‚Äôve been using Grub hub for about an year now and the amount of time my foods been stolen is ridiculous and when you do talk to customer support they think everybody is a child sounds like they are talking down to you then all they do you return your money when food is stolen but not like it won‚Äôt happen again but yep let me keep throwing my money at an delivery app that takes hours sometimes to deliver due to the fact how lazy there drivers are then you do meet some drivers that are nice and good at what they are doing but I only met 3 in the past year of me using it such a bad experience and customer support does not help this clause at all could at least give me a discount for the next food order after my food been stolen but nope and then get hanged up on twice by not only my driver but also the customer service love to see it and how I do much regret spending even one cent on this garbage app and service,1
grubhub,302920553,2022-11-06 19:10:23,"Good app, but the drivers are unpredictable","There‚Äôs nothing wrong with the app itself. I find it very easy to use, and it has many features that improve quality of life such as express reordering and multiple methods of payment.

Customer service I‚Äôve found to be divisive among people who use this app. I personally have had nothing but good experiences. The representatives were kind, helpful, and able to resolve my issues quickly. Hopefully you have the same care.

But those issues all stemmed from one thing: the drivers. I understand how busy they can be and how undertipped they are. But sometimes they can‚Äôt seem to follow simple instructions. I‚Äôve had drivers not show up until 30 minutes after I was notified they would arrive, had orders have missing items, and some orders weren‚Äôt even delivered to the right address. 

All I have to say is sometimes it‚Äôs better to go get the food yourself. Understand that you‚Äôre placing your trust in one person to get your food and bring it to you. Sometimes they‚Äôll fail to even do that. There are lots of amazing GrubHub drivers out there, trust me, but you‚Äôre likely to have a few bad ones.",4
grubhub,302920553,2022-11-13 00:57:18,Useless,"I received a grubhub gift card and tried using it, my order was over the amount of the gift card so i added my debit card and paid the remaining balance with no problem. my order went through and immediately got cancelled, apparently it ‚Äúdidn‚Äôt get processed‚Äù. customer service told me they‚Äôd refund me within 48 hours and here we are, 48 hours later with no refund. to make matters more frustrating, now anytime i try to order something it tells me to enter my credit card, venmo, or apple pay. i‚Äôve connected my venmo and my apple pay and neither of them will work as payment. i‚Äôve tried my credit card and debit card and it keeps telling me to enter the correct card number despite me doing so atleast 8 different times. i‚Äôm getting fed up to the point of just deleting the app and telling everyone i know to NEVER use grubhub ever. Uber eats is way better and their fees are cheaper anyways.",1
grubhub,302920553,2022-09-12 02:40:03,Delivery Issues,"As a person that works in the kitchen at a restaurant- I know first hand that when items are missing- it‚Äôs not a driver issue - it‚Äôs a restaurant issue. Some restaurants / fast food places will close up the bags so the driver don‚Äôt get access and that‚Äôs for food safety. If you are missing items from an order call the place you ordered from. They are responsible for getting the order correct NOT delivery drivers!!  
I‚Äôm so grateful that we see some of the best drivers who take their job seriously.  If they can double check orders they will but ultimately it‚Äôs the responsibility of the place you ordered from!!
Thank you GrubHub for providing a great service!!",5
grubhub,302920553,2022-10-28 00:14:25,Horrible customer support,"The reason I called customer care was because the driver left my food out on the sidewalk in front of my apartment building and didn‚Äôt bother to call or text through the app, just sent a picture of the food on the dirty concrete, and dogs use that area to relieve themselves often. I called customer care and the tier one person (Salim) was rude and made me repeat the grievance over and over rather than just giving me to a supervisor as I had asked. 

My husband had to reiterate the story of the crummy delivery drop off to both Salim and his supervisor before we finally got a refund for the inedible food, but no additional credits for our trouble. GrubHub‚Äôs customer care system typically allows customers to review their experiences with operators; however, the supervisor disconnected the call before my husband could do so. Thus we‚Äôre going more public with how terrible this experience was.",1
grubhub,302920553,2022-09-14 00:58:15,Order Not Delivered,"I placed an expensive order on Grubhub. The driver never delivered the order to my apartment and order was not at other units or at any of the front doors of the building. The driver never called or texts. And after the order claimed delivery, there was no option for me to contact the driver.

The app does not enable users to write reviews for poor driving service. Therefore it seems if a driver steals food or leaves food in an unsecured area, the driver gets away with what was done.

I did contact customer service and the order was replaced. However, there was no additional compensation for the additional wait time. After pressing hard with customer service, I was finally give a 20% discount on a future order, which expires in 1 month - why the expiration???

Regardless, I am frustrated that the driver is allowed to get away with this and that I have no way of being able to contact the driver to ask where the food is.

Customer service ought to be more generous upfront when things like this happen to ensure customers remain loyal to their service.

It was an awful experience. And my impression of Grubhub has significantly reduced. 

I hope this review is shared up the chain of command. Things like this need a solution and ought to be better handled so that their reputation is preserved.",1
grubhub,302920553,2022-12-08 23:07:12,Room for improvement.,"The map updates very slowly when you are viewing the progress of the driver. I was on the phone with one and trying to direct him, and the map was well behind his actual location.

Grubhub also fails to create driver profiles that are simple to view and rate like Uber does. With Uber, you can click on the driver profile and view comments, ratings, specific qualities, and other information. Once the order is completed, Uber has you rate right away to encourage a response.

On Grubhub there is no such thing. With Grubhub you have to go out of your way to do a rating for a driver, so the only people who will likely be doing that are ones who have a negative rating to give. I found this out trying to rate my driver for going above and beyond, which would have been easy to do with Uber but not with Grubhub. You cannot clarify any details with your order after the fact or anything else like you can with Uber.

The search option is clearly incomplete based on the results received depending on how you choose to sort them.

Other than that, the food is there, and it works the same as any other app.",3
grubhub,302920553,2022-11-03 06:31:28,Worst service ever.,So I order from a place 5 minutes away. The driver is positioned 10 minutes away from me. 5 minutes from the restaurant. I called to confirm the food was ready for pick up 20 min after ordering. The driver proceeds to just drive around for whatever reason for 40 min. Literally went back and forth to the street the restaurant was on 3 times and never once grabbed my food. Now finally after an hour or so I receive my food and it‚Äôs cold. So I ask for not even a full refund but atleast half my money back cause I‚Äôm not eating a cold sandwich that should of just came off a press. Then you have the nerve to say you can only give me 5$ credit back!? Then the agent ‚Äúhelping‚Äù me proceeds to say he is gonna transfer me to another department and ends the communication and hangs up on me. I hope your company gets shut down. Terrible service.,1
grubhub,302920553,2022-11-03 02:17:43,The worst,"Placed an order and waited 2 and a half hours, called the restaurant and was told the food was picked up a while ago, I couldn‚Äôt reach the driver nor the restaurant could.
When I chatted with customer service twice,
No one could reach the driver or call the restaurant, the restaurant blamed GrubHub and GrubHub blamed the restaurant. At this point my food was already cold 2.5 hours later- I asked for a refund and an email to write a complaint, BUT the chat was ended by the representative. Uber would have NEVER done this. The restaurant reported that the driver PICKED UP the order, but the driver CANCELLED IT- which means he got to enjoy my dinner instead‚Ä¶ and GrubHub still said it was getting delivered. As it is now. So safe to say, someone stole my food, a GrubHub employee, so I will never be trusting this company again. 
No help,  no support, no nothing.

Today, I ordered from shake shack and got a text from shake shack that my order was ready. I looked in the GrubHub app and it didn‚Äôt have a driver assigned to my order. I reached out to customer service and the agent, Ralph, after I said that I got the text from shake shack still told me that my order was in the works and they hadn‚Äôt assigned a driver as a result. I said it wasn‚Äôt still in the works because I received the text from shake shack that it was ready. As a response he just ignored what I said and repeated that the order was in the works and would arrive in about 40 minutes. (Meaning it would be ice cold). THEN they canceled my order meaning my order is sitting in shake shack being wasted and I don‚Äôt have time for lunch. Ever since GrubHub bought Seamless the service has been atrocious. I miss old seamless.",1
grubhub,302920553,2022-10-30 17:08:47,GrubHub does not validate your orders are processed.,"GrubHub places orders, but it does not check the response from the restaurant to see if the order has been received and will be processed successfully. They only time they confirm is when the driver arrives at the restaurant and reports a problem with the restaurant?!

On two separate occasions, I tried placing order to a local cafe that Google Maps shows is open.

On both occasions, GrubHub falsely reported that my order was complete, and it was on its way.  On both occasions, 10 minutes before my food was supposed to arrive I received an alert that my order was canceled and I would receive a refund.

I got no further communication the first time this happened. However, I got a phone call the second time. I asked GrubHub why did they wait until my food was supposed to arrive to tell me there was a problem. The rep then shared that GRUBHUB DOESN‚ÄôT KNOW THERE IS A PROBLEM WITH THE ORDER/RESTAURANT UNTIL THE DRIVER ARRIVES TO PICKUP THE ORDER!!!!

It is beyond ridiculous to expect customers to find it acceptable that GrubHub doesn‚Äôt do a verification via API that the order is being processed. Do the Product Managers pay attention to the customer experience?!",2

I contact customer service they say it will be another hr, and give me a 10$ perk. I cancel the order and place a new one. The new driver delivers the old order that had been sitting for 2 hrs and keeps the fresh order. I contacted the restaurant to find out if there were two orders so I know there was no reason for the food to be cold. The order I received had the initial time of the first order I placed. I contact support again for a full refund cause everything is freezing cold. Instead they give me $5 off my next purchase. Deleting my account and the app.",1
grubhub,302920553,2022-12-06 10:08:13,Better than Doordash,"So I‚Äôve always used different delivery services and Grubhub always hits the right spot. I‚Äôm so disappointed to see a lot of bad reviews on Grubhub, because there‚Äôs a lot of better support on Grubhub vs Doordash and Grubhub is an ethical service. My guess is on the App Store, Doordash dominates Grubhub unfairly. If you actually compare the prices from Doordash and Grubhub disregarding the prices, Doordash charges a lot more. And lastly Grubhub takes long, but somehow the food is always still magically warm? Compared to most delivery services? As a customer I hope that Grubhub get the recognition it deserves and doesn‚Äôt change.",5

grubhub,302920553,2022-10-23 21:42:59,No Control,"GrubHub has no control over your order. They are just there to take a fee. Customer service is very polite, but useless. Once you place an order, you have to hope for the best. Maybe it will be there on time, maybe it will be an hour late. Maybe your courier will pick up your order when it is ready or take a nap, grab some lunch, take a few trips via some ride app or just sit at home watching tv and cancel 45 minutes after your food was ready. You can‚Äôt blame the restaurant, can‚Äôt switch drivers even if they aren‚Äôt moving for 30 minutes, and you can‚Äôt edit a tip. Even if you could edit the tip, the person who made you wait an extra hour canceled so you would be punishing an innocent courier.",2

So many times they string you along with an order and tell you someone is on their way when in truth there‚Äôs no one coming and the order isn‚Äôt on its way. And nearly all of not all orders that do make it have issues. This is the worst, in my experience, of any of the delivery apps. And barring the Bezos investment, I fully expect this company to fail. The product and service is terrible. The customer service is terrible. And I don‚Äôt need to sell it any harder than that. As soon as anyone uses it, they will realize how bad it is and be sad about the fact they‚Äôve downloaded it at all. Jeff, wish you would have brought us something, but this company is terrible.

grubhub,302920553,2022-10-17 18:55:08,Lack of Online Coupon Acceptance,"Subway does this because it has franchises as individual owners, and screws the bottom line, but Arbys could easily get a boost in business if they put QR codes on their coupons. 

Sure, they lose out on a dollar or something for every one, but corporations can easily afford to do this. People don‚Äôt have cars, and when the weather gets rough for people who bike from place to place, things can get out of hand. Plus, it gives the coupons people usually throw away a solid use, while also giving people a means to get their money‚Äôs worth.

If college students get a ton of these in their mail every week, then why not make them worth the gas, paper, and landfill waste? Arbys can do better here, and it‚Äôd be great to see that happen.",1

Just missing condiments on all 3 of your meals. The second order the food was all wrong. Missing items. Incorrect burgers wrong condiments. The only thing they got right was the beverage and sides. The third order when the food arrived it was from a completely different restaurant that we ordered from. We gave the food back to the driver because it wasn‚Äôt our food. When we contact grub hub they said the have to do research on our Order and can take up to 10 days. They are holding my money with food that wasn‚Äôt even delivered.

Hoping your customers won‚Äôt notice? #2 it took me way too long to even find out where I could talk to a real human. Hoping that a hard-to-find option of real support means GrubHub is hoping that people will just give up when they need help instead of fixing their crappy policies. #3 the human I actually chatted with was incredibly helpful and solved my issue in less than a minute.

I once expressed regret to her for not hearing what she had to say. Instead of politely repeating the phrase back, this woman continues to blast the phrase at me. Additionally, even if it doesn't concern me, every time someone cancels an order on Grubhub, the business does not opt to at the very least phone the restaurant to inform them that the order has been canceled.

Not only that but whenever I try to place an order (without) the membership, it gets immediately cancelled. I‚Äôve also contacted them about the issue but they say it must be a glitch. They give me no solution.

Please, this shouldn‚Äôt be a thing and I feel like you guys are kind of punishing the drivers for my own incompetence in a way. Will change to 5 stars once it‚Äôs added.

Plenty of $ there?Customer service says for my protection??? But i can use the app in 48 hours. Well that doesn‚Äôt do me any good  now.

This last experience resulted in this review. I‚Äôve been disconnected from customer service and have had questions that were refused to be answered. 

This time was hilarious. 

My driver gave us a pizza from another restaurant, the wrong size and cold. No problem, but going to customer service was crazier. I asked for a refund, the asked if I could get the $$ right away to use I also asked if they had expedited delivery on Seamless. This person told me they couldn‚Äôt refund, I‚Äôd have to wait 3-5 days.. fine, what‚Äôs the total? I was told to check my email.. 

I asked what about my other question.. this person answered,‚Äùnothing.‚Äù

I switched to Grubhub and at first I loved it. The problem is if you order something far it comes faster than if you want something from a spot close by. I ordered from a McDonalds thats 5 min away and its been over an hour. The driver picked my food up but has been doing other deliveries. Now my food will be cold and at this point Id rather have loaded my newborn up in the car to just drive down there so I can have a warm meal.",2

The driver was amazing and even made it inside to put the food by my door rather than just outside, so I gave them an additional tip. Afterwards I made a claim with the toast and they refunded me everything. Tip included, with no warning. I told them that had they told me the driver tip would have refunded, I would have opted out of the refund.

They gave no warning and when I asked if there was no way around that, I get told ‚ÄúThey make salary anyway‚Äù. Tips can be everything to a driver and it was such a negative interaction that I wont be using the service again. Treat your drivers better, Grubhub (and any 3rd party delivery service).",1

Then my foods cold and gross. I understand I can go to the restaurant and pick it up myself, but grub hub if your offering a service and I‚Äôm paying for it then do what you say your business does.

The final straw was ordering food and then it being delivered almost an hour later where the food was cold and soggy. The solution, after I had spent almost $30, was a $5 credit to my account. I assume people order hot food so they don‚Äôt have to cook and here you are then having to heat up your food anyway.

I ordered lunch and the driver arrived, did not call me, ‚Äúdelivered‚Äù the food in my apartment lobby and when i went down to get it, nothing was there. 

- there needs to be a better system of communication with the driver and the customer. Drivers want to get as many deliveries as they can and so they wont even wait a minute, and sometimes it works but sometimes they loose the food. 

Second time: 

I ordered breakfast this morning, and when i checked the map, my driver was very far from both my home and the restaurant. When i called him he said that the restaurant was closed and he had just kept working. I did not get a notification from him, and the app said that the restaurant was open. 

- The app cannot offer food from restaurants that are not open. And if they are closed, again, there needs to be a better system of communication between the driver and customer so i can know that it was closed, instead of just waiting 20 minutes.",1

I called customer service and they told me they couldn‚Äôt tell me why I can‚Äôt order food. They said I would get an email in 3-4 days, which is obviously no help tonight. My credit card was charged for each of the deliveries they can‚Äôt deliver, they said I have to also wait 5-7 days for that to be refunded. I guess this service is okay if you have money to spend on food that will never come and that you have to wait a week to have refunded. Not for me!",1
grubhub,302920553,2022-11-06 00:14:36,A price gauging monopoly. very low ethical standards,"What grubhub has done has destroyed the restaurant business, they‚Äôve choked restaurants for a high percentage of their profits - they‚Äôre left with no choice but to work through grubhub to survive  

They dont pay their delivery workers enough and instead put the social pressure on the customer to pay the wage of their workers. A disgusting corporate tactic becoming more and more the norm. 

Companies like this work because in the beginning everything is so convenient and inexpensive, then, once they have everyone hooked on their system, they raise the service fees, they add another hidden fee, they rip the rug right out from under you and now were paying 15$ in fees BEFORE even tipping the only person actually doing the work, the driver, who makes next to nothing. 

I use it now, but the moment there is a more ethical and customer friendly company grubhub will never see another dollar from me. I look forward to it",1

Efficient, professional, & food comes closed in packaging so it seems safe but the price to order with all the fees adds up quick. I only order from 3rd party delivery sites when I‚Äôm being really lazy or sick or use a place that doesn‚Äôt have their own delivery ppl. It‚Äôs an expensive last resort, yet reliable. Way better than door-dash drivers who typically just don't care and will argue",4

I app will say driver has your order but the location can‚Äôt be tracked and it still shows as being at the restaurant.

The refund from the first order for the missing item was only $25, however to place the order alone cost me over $40. Had to do it to feed my guests. 

Customer service informed me they would refund the difference, that never happened, put in another ticket and the next customer service rep blew me off.

If I could I would go grab the food myself but there‚Äôs a reason I order it. Their only solution always is to give money back and $5 credit.

But when i do use grubhub, I‚Äôm milked for every penny I have. I ordered two 5-piece chicken tendies and it‚Äôs original price was $24. Grubhub then slams me with a delivery fee, a service fee, tax, and tip. The price doubled to $44‚Ä¶ for 10 chicken tenders‚Ä¶ and to remove the delivery fee you need a subscription for $8 a month.

Never again. I am removing the app and getting rid of the subscription. 

I constantly have items missing. 1 in 5 orders will have all of the items there. It is a fight to get a refund on the missing items. When you only order occasionally, they are fine giving refunds. But when you order 1-2x a week, they don‚Äôt like to give refunds for missing items because they think you are just trying to get a refund all the time when that‚Äôs not the case. 

Then there is the ice cold food. I‚Äôm not spending $100 dollars for cold food. Not only is that a major health concern, it‚Äôs not what I paid for, and they refuse to do anything other than give you a 5 dollar coupon for cold food. Not cool.",1

grubhub,302920553,2022-10-26 23:49:37,Here's my honest opinion,GrubHub is convenient and less expensive than other delivery places often food does get delivered cold and constant missing items. Most drivers are kind. GrubHub refunds quickly and has mostly nice customer service. Overall great. Just have had some incidents.,4
grubhub,302920553,2022-10-14 23:33:02,Random Delivery Times & Terrible Customer Service,"I‚Äôve had too many orders change the delivery time. Worst part is that GrubHub has a policy that says ‚ÄúFood late, we‚Äôll give you a voucher‚Äù but they change the delivery time before you can even put that option in. Customer service is hit or miss. Honestly you‚Äôre better off with UberEats or DoorDash.",3
grubhub,302920553,2022-10-12 04:11:47,Awful,"Grub hub never rings the bell or texts.  They just leave the food and hope you‚Äôll wander to the front door and see it‚Äôs there.  You can put a note on your order, you can click the little check that says ‚Äòtext me‚Äô, you can tip $10‚Ä¶..but it doesn‚Äôt matter.   Your food will sit there outside and you‚Äôll never even know it.   This has happened over and over and over again.  Completely insane way to run a delivery service.  Bye grub hub.",1

grubhub,302920553,2022-11-20 23:24:57,It‚Äôs almost always wrong,Not feeling well so have gotten grub hub this weekend for the family.  I‚Äôve ordered it 4 times in two days.  Three out of four times the order was wrong.  The last time it took 2x the length of time it was suppose to and when it got here the ice cream was almost completely melted.  Did I mention it was not even the correct order?  You pay extra for convenience but all you get is cold food you didn‚Äôt even want.,1
grubhub,302920553,2022-11-07 01:56:22,Bad Delivery Driver,"He didn‚Äôt drop off my food when I was waiting at the drop off. Refused to give any landmarks when I asked for them; and there are VERY obvious landmarks. Grubhub gave me a re-delivery but decided to assign the SAME driver who didn‚Äôt deliver the first time. Didn‚Äôt accept my order cancel which is fine, but still decided to do a second delivery. So the driver still got my money! I‚Äôm okay with the restaurant being paired but why should he get my money when he ruined my night?",1

Itemized receipts are a requirement most companies have when it‚Äôs time to get reimbursed. I was shocked when the GrubHub costumer care representative just told me I‚Äôd need to contact everyone of my coworkers who ordered food using the Group Order link that‚Äôs generated through the Apps

The first time a meal was left on the counter and the second time one item was missed.  Applebees said I need to contact Grubhub for a refund.  I was not able to find any contact info for Grubhub so I was out the food and the money.    On the second order I did tell them of the prior error in the comments but I surmise they don‚Äôt care.  They got their money at my loss.,1
grubhub,302920553,2022-09-28 23:48:18,Grubhub Review,"I like Grubhub. I order a few times a week through the app in spite of any issues that may arise. 
Firstly, their customer service is really outstanding. Each person tries their best to respectfully solve your issue. 
I have to mention the prices are quite high and by the time you come out of the app you are paying a pretty penny for your food. 
Many of the restaurant employees don‚Äôt read the order properly either. 
Lastly, time is never a priority. The drivers often come from all over to bring the food and by the time it gets here it‚Äôs cold. 
In spite of all this Grubhub is the best app. And by all but a few dollars worth the price.",3
grubhub,302920553,2022-09-24 18:59:04,Food never came,"After being delayed once I looked back on the map and the driver still wasn‚Äôt going to the store. Contacted customer service, said it would be around 30 more minutes (another delay). I had so much time to think about how lazy I am and decided to get get it myself. God as my witness the restaurant was 5 minutes to my house, terrible all around. First time using Grubhub too. Despite doordash having a terrible menu it‚Äôs much more efficient.",1
grubhub,302920553,2022-12-19 01:29:47,Just order from the restaurant directly,"It‚Äôs bad enough the amount of fees they tack on to every order, but most of the menu prices are dollars more than what the restaurant charges. What would have been an $18 order from a restaurant jumped up to $35 before tip solely from fees, taxes, and GH charging $3 more per item from that restaurant. 

Never again. I‚Äôve had my account since they came to Chicago, but I will not use them anymore at all. Nearly $20 surcharge is ridiculous.",1
grubhub,302920553,2022-12-16 02:33:25,Always missing food!!!,"Be careful‚Ä¶ Grubhub is NOT reliable. It seems like the delivery drivers are NOT trained to double check ‚Äúorders.‚Äù They simply  pick up without confirming they have everything. 

What‚Äôs worse is that once you claim that food is missing on the Grubhub help service, all they do is say ‚Äúsorry and refund you.‚Äù They miss the whole point of the inconvenience they have caused and the reason why we ordered delivery for a reason!! They‚Äôre ridiculous!!",1

When we called to get a refund, the lady said the restaurant had to. But when we called the restaurant, the owner said grub hub had to issue the refund.

Terrible business. I hope they get in trouble for all the people they are stealing from.",1
grubhub,302920553,2022-12-16 00:17:47,Horrible customer service!,Often the app tells me my food is delivered but it‚Äôs not! There‚Äôs no accountability! They will sometimes refund your money (3-5 business days) and sometimes not! The people in customer service (like Emily H) just stop the chat whenever you tell them that just getting a refund in 3-5 business days and no food is not satisfactory just hang up and get off the chat. For the high cost I would imagine better customer service!,1

Had I known it was hooters I wouldn‚Äôt have placed the order to begin with because hooters is one of those places where the food is only good if you‚Äôre right there. The lettuce was slimy and transparent, bread was soggy as well as the pickles, and the fries were cold and hard. Completely inedible.

grubhub,302920553,2022-12-18 01:31:52,Service fee,I just feel like it‚Äôs kinda expensive especially when the driver has to do all the work. A service fee? Yeah grubhub just take away the delivery fee only to charge me extra on a service fee. Sounds like grubhub is just taking advantage of their customers and drivers.,3
grubhub,302920553,2022-11-13 22:01:41,Late deliveries,"Food deliveries always late no matter how much time is provided . You could order food first thing in the morning for dinner and even after all that time it is late. Don‚Äôt plan on it for conferences when you have a specific lunch period.

grubhub,302920553,2022-12-16 21:06:07,Deliveries Are Often Wrong!,Would it take any more time for a driver to check the contents of the order with the restaurant as opposed to blindly grabbing a bag of food and having unsatisfied customers.

We waited two hours for the person to deliver our food and no one showed up! And last month when she ordered from GrubHub the Woman that was supposed to give us our food Was going the opposite direction! Never ordering from here ever again! üò°",1
grubhub,302920553,2022-11-27 22:56:39,Great app,Love the service and product but the app has a lot of competition. User friendly and has great deals in ur local area; also has a majority of restaurants and fast food in your local area.,4
grubhub,302920553,2022-10-24 22:51:46,Never use this app,They give you the option to have ‚Äúcontact less delivery‚Äù or in person delivery. When I pick the in person option they still leave my food at the gate. So many times someone else took my food or they just delivered it to the wrong address. Much easier to drive to the restaurant and pickup the food myself.,1
grubhub,302920553,2022-10-15 00:08:18,Bad Service,My account was suspended for no reason whatsoever. I was not allowed to order anything from anywhere even though my payment went through. They kept refunding me on every order. When I called customer service they said they could not tell me want my account was suspended. Such bad service and customer care. So disappointed.,1
grubhub,302920553,2022-10-31 02:15:25,Great app worth it,"Such a useful app, extremely user friendly, no issues whatsoever, straightforward and easy to earn money and even set goal.",5

grubhub,302920553,2022-11-21 21:48:43,Worst service ever,"Your app is terrible to many complications with the gps and delivery the drivers are doing there part by delivering the food just never to the right address I hope in the future this is resolved or this company is dissolved, very unsatisfied I only used this app because I didn‚Äôt see Wendy‚Äôs on Uber eats with 0 dollar delivery will never order from this app again.",1
grubhub,302920553,2022-11-16 21:42:15,Horrible Customer Service,They already don‚Äôt have the greatest selection of restaurants. Their customer service blocked my chat feature. They kept giving me the run around. To be told no one was there to help me? This was all over a $5 credit. Don‚Äôt waste your $$$ they don‚Äôt even have chic fil a. Use door dash Uber eats.,2
grubhub,302920553,2022-10-30 13:46:10,Delicious food,Picked up a pizza from one of Riverhead‚Äôs finest restaurants last night. If you want a pie that‚Äôs done right along with the authentic Italian food they prepare; this is the place to visit. Thank you Cucina25!!,5
grubhub,302920553,2022-10-19 15:58:44,Grub hub,We use it when we are out and need a bite to eat- No often- but everytime we have used it - It has been great- Convenient and easy to use.,5
grubhub,302920553,2022-10-17 01:12:45,Great food,"Asian boneless chicken wings are good, ask for extra sauce. Onion rings are amazing, my grandson liked his ham and cheese sub. They have kids subs. Over all wish the kids subs was a few dollars cheaper. I would recommend eating at Slacks.",5
grubhub,302920553,2022-09-29 23:57:57,Competitors Are Better,"I have the premium service for DoorDash GrubHub and Uber eats. I‚Äôve never had as many issues with the other two that I have had with Grubhub. Today, for the second time in a row, I‚Äôve wasted an hour or two trying to order through Grubhub. Either the food never arrives or the order is terribly incorrect. Cannot recommend the app any less.",1

grubhub,302920553,2022-12-08 23:12:44,Recently broken,"Congratulations, one of your recent updates completely broke the app. It spins on an orange screen while launching now. It might be due to an vpn or ad blocker, but I don't have time to debug your app for you. And if that's the case, it's ridiculous to track users that pay real money for a service.

grubhub,302920553,2022-11-12 02:27:37,Not worth it,"Grubhub is very poorly run here in North Texas. The lack of drivers, poor customer service, very long delivery delays are not worth a consumers time and aggravation. How can a convenience service be so inconvenient? Until Grubhub gets their act together in switching to another service. My order took over an hour and a half to be delivered which is unacceptable. It‚Äôs not on the restaurant, it‚Äôs on Grubhub.",1
grubhub,302920553,2022-10-19 19:10:27,Worst compared to Uber and DoorDash,"Wouldn‚Äôt bother using this service. They don‚Äôt hire drivers that have any common sense. They have drivers who deliver their own orders instead of urs, then call back telling u the drivers outside and wants to know if u have their order. Just really unprofessional, on top of the fact they dunno what they‚Äôre doing half the time. Will not use them again.",1

grubhub,302920553,2022-09-29 15:02:22,Never had a good experience,"Seriously, I was fine waiting, but after 30 minutes my order was just cancelled. No explanation.

No refund. If the driver is late? No refund of course the food is going to be cold; don‚Äôt even want the food anymore.,3
grubhub,302920553,2022-11-28 02:20:17,Worst food delivery service on the market,"They don‚Äôt even have drivers to deliver your food and when you reach out to customer service, they‚Äôre no help whatsoever and actually super rude.

grubhub,302920553,2022-11-18 02:26:49,Conscience,My second try with this app and there‚Äôs issues on communication between customers and distributors last time. Hope this is better.,4
grubhub,302920553,2022-11-14 17:28:45,Terrible service. Cancelled my order after we waited  minutes,"This is completely unacceptable. This is why we stopped using Grubhub a year or so again. Your service is terrible, and you are completely insensitive to the customer having a lunch hour.

Thought we would try you again, and sorry that we did.",1
grubhub,302920553,2022-10-29 17:58:48,Greed,"I think it‚Äôs past time for delivery services as well as the restaurants do away with the service fees, (to cover operating costs). Fake Covid is no longer an issue. If a restaurant is still having trouble keeping the doors open, they should close the doors!!",3

grubhub,302920553,2022-11-19 20:06:35,My review was deleted because it wasn‚Äôt favorable to the company,"Stay away from Grubhub. The drivers are lazy and customer service is horrible. I was a loyal customer until recently. Long story short, my food never arrived even though I contacted and talked to the delivery drive. I had to fight tooth and nail to receive a refund, spoke with two representatives until I got my money back.",1
grubhub,302920553,2022-11-12 00:30:03,Credits disappear without warning,"I had a $35 credit, but when I went to order food, it was nowhere to be seen.  I only got the credit a week or two ago.  There should be an email warning us they're going to expire if there's a short expiration date on it!",2
grubhub,302920553,2022-10-05 20:10:50,Food always cold ‚Ä¶,Not sure how this thing works but every time I‚Äôm forced to use food apps like this my food is always cold and nasty. One time at work someone even cancelled picking up my order so it took 2 hours. Really disappointed. Would not recommend unless you have no other choice.,2
grubhub,302920553,2022-12-05 18:15:45,Terrible Service-Cancelled all orders,"Grubhub has cancelled the last 7 orders I‚Äôve made!! I have been gifted food gift cards to help my family as I recover from a tragic accident, and they must not service the area. Once it was an hour wait, and they cancelled it an hour after order. Do not buy gift cards or order through grubhub if you are located in the north west Minneapolis suburb.",1
grubhub,302920553,2022-11-20 17:27:52,Love this service,"Four stars, because I wish that when restaurants did there own delivery I could track their progress to my door.",4
grubhub,302920553,2022-09-17 17:59:47,Restaurant list deceiving,"I love Grubhub but I do not love that some restaurants are just certain foods from other restaurants listed, I.e ‚Äúwild burger‚Äù being just a list of burgers from Buffalo Wild Wings. It is very deceiving because it doesn‚Äôt state that in menu.",4
grubhub,302920553,2022-09-17 02:17:36,Orders always late. No compensation ever,My order has been over an hour late or has been dropped an hour after purchase the last three times I‚Äôve purchased. You cannot get ahold of them on the phone due to ‚Äúusually high call volume‚Äù and the people you talk to through the app refuse to refund you. Use any other food delivery app,1
grubhub,302920553,2022-09-23 02:47:14,Incorrect menu prices lead to being charged extra without consent.,Restaurants should not be able to charge the customers extra money b/c the app hasn‚Äôt been updated to show the new prices. That‚Äôs not the customer‚Äôs fault.,3
grubhub,302920553,2022-12-21 03:26:08,Worst delivery app,"My order was already going to be delivered late, switched several drivers before being cancelled. Waited almost an hour and a half before not even getting my food. Then their offering was $5 off next order which is what I already used on the one that got cancelled. Pretty pathetic solution if you ask me",1
grubhub,302920553,2022-12-10 02:11:41,ALWAYS late and ALWAYS cold,"It‚Äôs suspicious that Grubhub has so many reviews that are overwhelmingly negative, but still show as five stars. Anyway, every time we‚Äôve used them, the map always shows the driver going to the restaurant, then going to a completely different restaurant and doing another delivery before they finally arrive with your order.",1
grubhub,302920553,2022-11-27 16:22:01,Delivery drivers do not care about the disabled,Time and time again the delivery drivers ignore the delivery instructions that I am wheelchair bound and need the food delivered to my door. Instead they leave it on the front steps of my 6 story apartment building where it is immediately stolen. They could care less.,2
grubhub,302920553,2022-11-26 03:11:06,This app is trash,They take orders even when they have no drivers logged in/available then just keep delaying the order so you‚Äôre waiting an hour and a half just for them to end up cancelling due to not being able to find a driver. You could have eaten 4 times by then. I could have made 7 different meals JUST TELL US THERE IS NOONE AVAILABLE INSTEAD OF MAKING US WAIT NEARLY 2 HOURS WHILE HUNGRY JUST TO CANCEL YA JERKS!!!!!!!!!!!,1

grubhub,302920553,2022-10-31 02:15:43,Expensive waste,"Prices keep going up while service and speed continue to decline. Unless you have no other option, grubhub is definitely not worth paying double for your food just to get it an hour later. If you get it at all.",2
grubhub,302920553,2022-10-24 00:26:37,Horrible drivers always get lost,We live in the metro area of Boston and CONSTANTLY have delayed drivers over 2 hours from when we ordered - and when someone finally is found they can never navigate their way to our house. In this day and age how someone can have this job without being able to follow a gps is unacceptable.,1
grubhub,302920553,2022-10-17 15:45:24,Terrible Customer Service,"Incorrect order (which happens) but then followed by a poor customer service to which my chat was ended by the rep because I couldn‚Äôt respond quickly enough.

grubhub,302920553,2022-12-02 19:34:44,App is super sketchy,App would not allow me to update my address. Took me 20 minutes to have to delete and re-add the app. to get the address updated.  Then I was offered $5 but when it was time to pay the option for the $5 off was no where available.,2
grubhub,302920553,2022-11-30 00:54:05,Refuses to give refunds when you don‚Äôt get items,I have a huge problem with drivers leaving my drinks and kids meals out. Which is pretty much the sole purpose of me ordering food to make them happy and I can‚Äôt even manage that by using this app. So I‚Äôm out the money on those items and I gotta go spent the money again and go get it myself.,1

I payed for Grubhub +(which would be 0 delivery fee) it‚Äôs not even worth it cause everything still cost a lot (I have all these random fees ) that would make it add up to a lot. You are better off going to the restaurant and places in person to save some money . This app is not worth it.",1

Grub hub jacks up the food prices and adds on fees plus their ‚Äúmonthly‚Äù charge to have access to the plus features. For those that want delivery and don‚Äôt mind way overpaying for the convenience. So yes, since this how these apps are- one star it is.",1
grubhub,302920553,2022-09-25 02:28:55,Did NOT give me proper Coupon,This service did NOT give me a $25 coupon off for my first order. This is the ONLY reason I used this app. WILL NEVER be using this ‚ÄúGrubhub‚Äù a g a i n!!!!!,5

grubhub,302920553,2022-12-19 17:05:57,Food almost always late,It‚Äôs ok but they have drivers that deliver to complete opposite locations of where you are pretty frequently so your food is cold and will need some microwaving. On average add 20-30 minutes on to the original estimate. They charge a lot for service fees and delivery fees to get cold food delivered.,2
grubhub,302920553,2022-11-12 21:59:06,Easy,The process of finding and ordering what I want is fast and simple no matter where I am.,5

I ordered for my family and only received food for one or two, leaving the rest of the family with no food. When I contact the drivers I‚Äôm told that‚Äôs all they were given. So either the drivers are stealing the food or the restaurants aren‚Äôt getting the full orders. I‚Äôm betting that Grubhub isn‚Äôt getting the full orders to the restaurant, otherwise how is a $70 order only two small food items?

They offered a refund, but what I want is what I paid for. 

Do not recommend using.",1

grubhub,302920553,2022-12-04 23:38:11,Mediocre,Frequently late with customer service that has one response. Have a $5 or $10 coupon. They also have absurd fees tacked on top of upcharges on the food. Other than that it's a delivery service.,3

I should‚Äôve stuck to Uber eats. Learn from my mistake.,1
grubhub,302920553,2022-09-22 01:18:24,Grubhub+,Grubhub + is very misleading. I go to school at OSU and get Grubhub + for free. Which includes free delivery.

So I told them I will never use them again, and the customer service manager said she didn‚Äôt care‚Ä¶ really? I spend on average $1200 a month with them, so I guess that‚Äôs not enough?

After contacting Uber eats immediately- with proof of calls and emails they asked me to replace the order and would remove the charges. After countless times they did not remove both charges or fees totaling of over $100 because I now had to place the order twice. Over 5-7 calls with customer service the issue was never resolved and the service reps repeat themselves countless times over and over to apologize but have zero idea how to communicate or fix the issue. I asked for a supervisor and she said they‚Äôd contact me in a few business days and did not. After going to an event and speaking to a representative they offered me a $30 gift card which I tried to use tonight. After adding it to my account and placing the order the app said not available. Again, I called customer service and she asked me to delete the app and redownload it. Now the promo is gone if my $30 and over 30 minutes on the phone she asks me to wait 1-3 hours to figure out the issue. So again you have taken my money with no service and terrible customer service. Now the restaurant is closed and I have no gift card.

Both said they had been delivered, and I had been charged for both, but the hotel only had one. The driver of the entr√©e left a note that he couldn‚Äôt find the place. Apparently that doesn‚Äôt matter & I had to pay for it anyway because I ordered it in advance (the order was placed over two days from delivery). Absolutely no recourse for a refund. And I didn‚Äôt have dinner. I ordered a small grocery order for the following morning, water and 2 bottled coffees to be delivered by 8:20 am so that I could receive it before I left for services. By 8:45 it hadn‚Äôt arrived. I pushed the help button a number of times- BY THE WAY THERE IS APPARENTLY A HEFTY CHARGE FOR ASKING FOR ASSISTANCE FOR A SCREWED UP ORDER. So if you do make the mistake of downloading this app, don‚Äôt push that button. I had another order for lunch that was supposed to come that afternoon but was canceled with the explanation that ‚Äúthe restaurant couldn‚Äôt get your order together, sorry‚Äù. It was at that point I canceled all remaining orders, 3 or 4, switched to Grubhub and had zero problems. I‚Äôll not likely ever Uber anything again. Skip this disaster.",1
ubereats,1058959277,2022-11-30 15:05:49,Thanks for letting me get robbed multiple times and refusing to help,"I hate this app and have officially stopped using it after being played for the last time. For a month now, I have a petty neighbor because he beats on his girlfriend and I defend her by calling the police or telling our landlord. So I‚Äôm retaliation l, he‚Äôs stealing my stuff: groceries, deliveries and my food. I‚Äôve told this app about what was going on and why I was having to recive so many refunds this month and even told them about the police report I‚Äôve made because of all of this. They deleted my account‚Ä¶..their ‚Äúcustomer service‚Äù calls me a lier and ends the chat. Now they are claiming I have multiple accounts. I‚Äôm sorry that people scam you guys a lot but that isn‚Äôt every case. I barely order out anymore because of what my neighbor is doing. I ordered maybe 3 times and each time he‚Äôs stolen it. I‚Äôve even had a driver last night just not even deliver my food and THEY REFUSED TO REFUND ME! I sent a picture of the driver pretending to drop off me food, pick it up and leave with it (yes I tried to stop him but I‚Äôm 7 months pregnant, can‚Äôt really move that fast) all I wanted is my money back and I was made to seem like I was a liar and a theft. So I don‚Äôt recommend this app at all, honestly I don‚Äôt recommend any of these ‚Äúdelivery apps‚Äù DoorDash allows too many thefts, ubereats refuses to listen to their customers and grubhub is ridiculously expensive.",1
ubereats,1058959277,2022-11-26 23:18:08,Totally disappointed,"This app worked fine for a while, then it started to involve some operations that failed the customer satisfaction for sure. I just ordered a dinner a couple of days ago and everything was just fine until minutes after the order was placed and almost ready to deliver. So it happened that I opened the app to check order status and my order was canceled, and the stated argument was that I called the restaurant to cancel the order over phone. Besides that Uber customer service told me when chatting that they were sorry and my $ can‚Äôt be refunded because I have canceled too many orders recently which was totally false and not demonstrated. Then #1 how is it possible that Uber may allow a customer to cancel and order over phone that he placed online through the app instead of canceling using the app, and #2 how is that you can tell me I won‚Äôt receive full refund for a non-demonstrated action. Guys you need to improve your operations or if this continues happening you will totally lost many clients. I uninstalled the app and hope to find some other new app or an entrepreneur who can do a little better with less complications because this is a difficult time to waste $ for no good reason. I better call straight to the restaurant and make my order than handle my $ to such an irresponsible entity.",2
ubereats,1058959277,2022-12-12 15:55:05,Refund,So as of today I deleted this app and I‚Äôm no longer giving my business to Uber for them to steal from me. I ordered an item from a restaurant mango‚Äôs grill Keller but on the same day i decided to cancel it and order something else from the same restaurant. Upon my cancellation the app told me it would be a standard 4-7 business days for my refund to be processed so I was alright waiting but it was already 5 days and I had not received my refund so I decided to follow up and see what the hold up was just for Uber to transfer me over and over and end up not resolving my issue just to receive an email that I was not eligible for a refund. I tried to call and a customer service agent from Uber notifies me that because it was past 48hrs of me contacting uber about my refund that they would not issue it back to me because they have ‚Äòprocedure‚Äôs‚Äô in place to be followed. I am not going to get my refund because I followed the process that the app told me to but apparently I was supposed to call Uber to cancel the order for me. How does this make sense? Why are there not steps on the app then to be user friendly and also give out information about cancellation and what not. This app has left a bad taste in my mouth and please be careful anyone using the app. This is daylight theft. Save your money and go get your orders to go or dine-in. My two cents. If I could put 0 stars for this review I would.,1
ubereats,1058959277,2022-11-13 21:23:39,Wow wow wow wow,"I cannot believe what just happened, Uber eats randomly charged me a 30$ ‚Äúauthorization fee‚Äù (this‚Äù fee‚Äù was only labeled after hours trying to get someone to help me), right as I was placing my order- so when I agreed to it I was under the impression I was saying okay to my order being placed. I was placing an order around the same price, slightly higher than this ‚Äúfee‚Äù, which at the time I assumed it was the discount being applied like the button I clicked on, said would be applied. It goes through, and when I go to check my orders eta- no such record of the order has been placed but the money sure has been taken out of my account! Customer service pretended to check on my order then claimed they were transferring me to someone with more resources than they currently had, and ended the chat with me. No transfer was made, no contact was attempted. So I go through the process again- this time I am told to check my email. All the while I am out the amount of my order and no order has been placed and no one is offering me any type of solution. I check my email and about an hour later I get the explanation that this is an authorization fee that will be released in 3-10 days. It would have been better if they just said, ‚Äúwe‚Äôre sorry we messed up‚Äù, vs. the ridiculous explanation I was given. I‚Äôm sure it‚Äôs for legal reasons, but I feel like I was politely robbed.",1
ubereats,1058959277,2022-10-21 00:52:53,Great until your order is messed up,"I like the convenience of using Uber Eats, however, there‚Äôs been too many times where my order was either missing items or incorrectly prepared. Now in this situation, of course most people will contact support for assistance, to request a refund of those missing items or incorrect order. The problem with this is, Uber gives a cap on how much they will refund over a period of time. 

Now, I understand there‚Äôs limits, due to help prevent abuse, but if you request a picture and description of the issue and it‚Äôs provided, then something should be done to help the consumer. Say I ordered a chicken sandwich and received a hamburger, and I clearly show that I received something different, then saying you can‚Äôt provide a refund and you‚Äôll reach out to the merchant to help prevent it from happening again, doesn‚Äôt help the consumer. This penalizes the consumer and makes them less likely to use the service again, due to something outside of their control.

Some people spend a lot of money on delivery food to have food missing or incorrectly prepared food, only to be stuck with no solution from the service provider. I nearly signed up for an annual subscription, I‚Äôm soooo glad I didn‚Äôt. Be careful for anyone that does sign up for the annual plan to save money. Once you reach your cap on support, you won‚Äôt get any more assistance with messed up orders.",1
ubereats,1058959277,2022-11-19 23:15:04,So many bugs,"I wrote this review a year and a half ago. I STILL cannot understand for the life of me why this broken app gets anywhere near 5 stars. Even the bad reviews have five stars. I am at a loss. This time I came back to point out that they removed the option to add a note of instructions. Now I can‚Äôt tell them to hold the lettuce. Maybe it‚Äôs all the people in the US, because Uber would rather invade and colonialize Latin America than actually try to fix their app. It‚Äôs well and truly baffling that they get this much praise. One example is that the app can‚Äôt figure out where I am nor where places are. Either it puts the delivery guy a block away and doesn‚Äôt let me fix the location or the application simply changes the location to somewhere I am not. I literally had to add a location in Google maps and name it as if it were my own business in order to get them to come to that point on the map. Worse yet it‚Äôs profoundly frustrating that there is no in app support or chat, the only possible place I have ever gotten a single helpful response is on Twitter. Twitter is a social media application not a support platform and now it‚Äôs been tanked by Elon. I guess when you manage to undercut everyone out of the market and secure the back pockets of politicians through US imperialism and begin dominating the industry, you have zero incentive to fix anything or provide support.",1
ubereats,1058959277,2022-12-20 11:46:45,Scammer drivers one click away,"My large taco order to help a friend who was running low on food at his party was never delivered. I tipped up front to boost the odds my order arrives quickly and safely. Then, all of a sudden, the app alerts me that the food was delivered. Uhhh, no. I‚Äôm pacing the front yard in the sub-freezing weather to ensure a quick handoff. Not a car in sight. Using the app‚Äôs map,  I saw the driver, Ryan, about 2 blocks away. I frantically tried to call him via the app but after multiple attempts was never able to get thru. As soon as I heard ringing, the call would be disconnected. Over and over again, that was my experience. Then the order in the app converted to delivered and that‚Äôs that. I kept trying to call and searched for helpful menu options, which were limited, until I suppose even Uber fatigued and suddenly presented me with a refund option that wasn‚Äôt there before.   I requested a refund but only the food cost was refunded. The driver happily cruised away with a tip, and presumably 24 tacos. 

Needless to say, the party guests were shocked at how easy it was to be scammed by an Uber Eats driver with no repercussions. I‚Äôm done with Uber Eats until I hear they have scamming under control.

Frankly, even refunding the tip isn‚Äôt enough. The stress and hassle and embarrassment of chasing down the driver via the app only tor walk back inside empty handed isn‚Äôt worth it.",1
ubereats,1058959277,2022-11-27 18:57:13,Buyers beware,"Received a promo for $30 off a grocery delivery. I was curious to compare using the grocer‚Äôs app. TLDR, Uber eats was more expensive than going through the grocers app even after the promo. All the prices were about 30+ cents more expensive on Uber eats. I created the same delivery order in the grocery‚Äôs app and the total after taxes and hidden ‚Äúfees‚Äù (about $15 on Uber) came to $6 less compared to Uber eats and that included a 20% tip where the Uber eats total did not, so it would have been even more expensive. Note there was no promo used on the grocer‚Äôs app other than automatically applied coupons. 

The odd thing is I‚Äôm pretty sure the Grocer still goes through Uber eats for delivery. Perhaps it‚Äôs door dash.. Crazy how an order on Uber Eats with $30 in promo credits costed more for the same items BEFORE adding a tip. Additionally, this cost comparison would still hold true even if I got an Uber eats membership which would have saved an additional $7 unless I didn‚Äôt tip on Uber eats for a total savings of $1 (which is lost to the membership fee). I‚Äôll go with the grocers app that also automatically applies various coupons and free pickup if desired. 

The promo appears to be misleading and could trick customers who might not be aware of alternatives, so 2/5 for the deceptive practice.",2
ubereats,1058959277,2022-09-16 17:34:37,Support will scam you,"I signed up for the plus membership which promises free delivery on most places. When browsing places to eat I found one that had the plus membership symbol, and stated free delivery. However at checkout I was being charged a delivery fee. I spoke to a support rep. and supplied them with pictures of the app stating no delivery fee on the front page and also at checkout where one was being applied. The rep. assured me that the way it works is that I will be refunded the delivery fee once the delivery has been completed. I voiced my confusion with such a business model to which they just kept reassuring me I could place my order and I would be getting my money back. It has been a week since and I was never refunded so I contacted a rep over the phone this time to which they told me the initial rep was wrong and I won‚Äôt be getting my money back. I then asked to speak to a higher up as they now scammed me into placing an order that I told them I would not be ordering if I had to pay the delivery fee since it was almost as much as the order itself. The new rep assured me their supervisor would contact me by the end of the night. That was 3 days ago. I even saved the chat log and would gladly supply it to them if they actually bothered to contact me. I will not be ordering from this service again, scammers.",1
ubereats,1058959277,2022-10-29 19:21:22,No refund on stale food,We usually order from a restaurant close to our place. We usually do pick up. When you go there and order. The food comes out to be really tasty. It‚Äôs a top rated restaurant. They usually are very busy on weekends. It‚Äôs from past few months that‚Äôs Uber eats are giving offers on orders. We ordered from this restaurant and the food comes out to be stale. Only the rice was okay as it was eatable. It was too salty. And the chicken was soggy it was smelling badly. Firstly I did not receive any response in 15 hrs. So I raised the request again. I have never wrote a review on AppStore. But this time it‚Äôs quite frustrating as the support manager says that they cannot give a refund this time as it will be not fair for everyone using the app. I didn‚Äôt understand. My simple concern was why should I pay for a food which is stale? Is it fair for a customer? I also attached a picture of food which I trashed. Isn‚Äôt it enough to prove that your customer is loyal? Also I have ordered online seven times from same restaurant. Whenever I order directly from this restaurant the food is good and whenever I order using some offer I receive food which is okay or stale. So is it about the offers? I am sorry as customer I am disappointed about the food and not the refund.,1
ubereats,1058959277,2022-11-10 14:51:49,Borderline scam artists,"I have been an Uber customer for 7-8 years now. Am an Uber one member for years now also. Am always grateful and appreciative and share the same. Until a couple weeks ago when my order was processed without proper promo. So I cancelled the order right away and then processed a 2nd order with the exact same items just with promo also being included properly. Uber then allowed the restaurant to charge me for 2 orders, stating they had started my first and had lost the food from it which was totally nonsense from the beginning. I figured given my thousands of Uber trips and maybe close to 1000 Uber eats orders that I have placed and never once had complained for no reason and this case is even clearer seeing as I ordered exact same items maybe 2-3 mins later and had no problem paying for them. Went thru Uber support and was actually told by Uber employee that I was going to be credited for first bogus charge. Then few minutes later I receive a separate message that stated that NO they were not going to make this right and that I have no recourse. Meanwhile like I said thousands of Uber rides and a 4.9 star gold member and this is way I have been treated. Uber is total disappointment and should be ashamed of themselves.",1

I then tried to contact customer support to see what was going on and the bot thought I wanted to cancel my order and charged me a $20 cancellation fee when I didn‚Äôt even want to cancel. After spending an hour texting customer support (because they don‚Äôt have a phone number), they tell me they processed a refund and to wait 3-5 business days. That never came. I contact them again two weeks later and they tell me there was nothing they could do because I need to contact them within 48 hours WHICH I DID.

ubereats,1058959277,2022-12-01 04:57:22,Uber eats has become a terrible app with terrible customer service.,"I was a Uber one member until it wouldn‚Äôt let me add a payment method and I just couldn‚Äôt use the app. When trying to resolve the issue they kept saying they were getting a tech error and I would be contacted back when I didn‚Äôt. When finally asked for a screen shot of the issue, it accidentally finally worked with one payment method and accidentally signed me up for a year which I didn‚Äôt want. I asked for a refund and to cancel my plan, when they tried to put it through again they said they were having a technical error and tech support was supposed to reach out. TWO WEEKS later I am still trying to contact and get the issue resolved and I have had no help. This app has become terrible.

I provided pictures for ‚Äúthe delivery,‚Äù yet I was still charged for the order, including delivery charges! How insulting is that?!

ubereats,1058959277,2022-09-21 18:14:53,Didn‚Äôt even get my order,"I recently tried to use Uber eats to get some Chinese from one of the restaurants in town. I ordered from said restaurant and patiently waited for my food to get to me. The driver never even moved to pick up my order. The app tried to find a new driver after 30 minutes, but no one was found. I waited another 30 minutes before I ended up canceling my order. I feel bad for the restaurant having to waste $25 worth of food because an incompetent driver didn‚Äôt pick up my food. I feel like I‚Äôve just been scammed and I won‚Äôt be giving UberEats another try. I‚Äôm currently waiting for my refund and won‚Äôt be ordering from you guys again.

Update: I got my full refund. I will say that the refund system is much better than DoorDash‚Äôs system. I got my money back right away. I did try to order through them again and basically the same thing happened to me. I had to refund again and got my money back right away.",5
ubereats,1058959277,2022-11-30 02:51:35,Horrible takes your money shame on you,"I have ordered from Uber eats numerous times as a graduate student. I have received ordered where my food is messed up and had items I am allergic to and had to be thrown away. No refund no help. Today I ordered food that was never delivered or was delivered to the wrong address and I got on chat and was told I made too many adjustments or complaints about past orders being the ones I received with either missing items or the orders were wrong!!! Several I had to throw away due to allergies. Then I am told I cannot receive a refund on a 50 something dollar order I never received. When I called same answer. The driver was not able to be reached on either end of Uber or I. You have a lost a customer, your competitors will go above and beyond to resolve issues and I have never once been refunded any missing incorrect and or wrong orders from Uber Eats. You treat your customers like trash. I am a graduate student who was treating myself to a nice meal for my standards and now I have no food and I‚Äôm our money (not cheap either). Shame on you, I will never be using your services again and will tell all my friends and family the same.",1
ubereats,1058959277,2022-12-02 14:28:32,Terrible Customer Service,"I was charged a ‚Äúcancellation fee‚Äù worth 2/3 of the order because the App didn‚Äôt update my location when I changed states and I had to cancel an order immediately after making it (less than 15 seconds) because it was going to the wrong state. First ‚Äúagent‚Äù gave me vague excuses about technical difficulties and ended the chat. Second agent assured me that the entire charge was a temporary hold. Contacted third agent because I was still charged and they told me, contrary to the second agent, that I was charged because the restaurant had already started the order. At the very least Uber needs to address the inconsistency. Moreover, if their system is truly so sensitive that an order can be irrevocably locked in as soon as the order is submitted, they either need better safeguards in the app or better integrated systems with the restaurants to prevent a trivial mistake like forgetting to change an address at checkout from costing the entire cost of the food. I understand paying for the cost of the user‚Äôs mistake to the company, but the one I was charged was outlandish relative to the mistake.",2

I was there when it said delivered in the place I asked her to take the food, and she‚Äôs weirdly enough a diamond member with like a 99% good rating. Though today, I believe she took my food or threw it away or something due to low tip. I called her 3 times, I was forwarded to voicemail after a few rings each time. I reached out to customer service with 3 different people and all of them said my account wasn‚Äôt eligible due to already receiving a refund on a totally different order like 6 months ago?

This has happened to me before where I tried picking up but it autoset to another location, it‚Äôs definitely my fault for not double checking but when you‚Äôre working all day and ready to get food you don‚Äôt really think about worrying to see if it‚Äôs the right location, especially since the place I go to is only 5 minutes away. On the phone call with customer service, I couldn‚Äôt even hear the lady. It was so loud and rowdy that I couldn‚Äôt make up on what she was saying, it sounded like a party and  then she had to put me on hold. So at the end of all that waiting, where I literally wasted 20 minutes trying to get a refund she flat out says we can cancel it but you‚Äôll be charged the full amount.

You can call Uber eats, but they have no way of elevating a situation like this which I have experienced many times  Customer service will apologize over and over, but they can not elevate this particular situation above a low level supervisor‚Äôs level so top management has no way to track their own company‚Äôs service. Not the type of company I would want to invest in, personal opinion only. 
I am old and no longer drive. I live on a fixed income so this service is extremely expensive for me. There are many people like me that depend on services like this.  Fortunately there are alternative service such as Grub Hub and Door dash. 
If management responds to this review,, I will reevaluate my position, otherwise, I will not use this company‚Äôs service anymore.

ubereats,1058959277,2022-11-23 02:58:27,Terrible customer service and no protection for users,"UberEATS doesn‚Äôt protect its users‚Ä¶ I ordered delivery over the weekend, when my food arrived, I noticed the restaurant overcharged me for an item (I paid for 50 frozen cheese breads in preparation for the holiday season and only received 12). I reported the issue to them immediately and they told me they don‚Äôt issue refunds and that I should reach out to the restaurant directly. I reached out to the restaurant, they admitted the mistake, and said they would offer the refund via UberEATS. A few days later, I haven‚Äôt seen the refund credit come through and contacted UberEATS to a response stating that I reported the issue too late and they don‚Äôt issue refunds. Also something about I have large amounts of refunds on my account‚Äîlast order mistake I reported was 3 years ago for under $20. It is such an arbitrary excuse on their part.

Basically, the restaurant admitted the mistake, I reported the issue immediately after receiving the order, asked UberEATS to issue the refund, and they refused. I just deleted this app. This is terrible customer service and now I am owed money I cannot get back‚Ä¶it‚Äôs extremely frustrating!",1
ubereats,1058959277,2022-10-20 15:14:30,HORRIBLE SERVICE WAITED 2 HOURS,"I usually always order Uber eats, so I know how it goes . I ordered yesterday night high priority. Well, the order submitted and the restaurant took the order. It literally took 2 hours for them to get a person to deliver it. As I spoke to customer service, they said a person was on the way. I was upset over it taking that long and I paid priority. The customer support asked if I just wanted it canceled and I said no. Next thing, after I waited (2 hours!) just get a person on the way, they canceled it after I said not too! Then the customer service person said they didn‚Äôt do it and ended the chat abruptly.  So my question is if the driver had the food why was it canceled and where did my food go? I do not care if I got my money back. That is BEYOND ridiculous  and unprofessional. I don‚Äôt want to order from this app again if that‚Äôs what they do. I waited for food until after midnight just for customer service to cancel it against my wishes. I could have ordered somewhere else for that. Now, I will use another app since this one is incompetent. I have the whole conversation and it‚Äôs horrible service!",1
ubereats,1058959277,2022-09-18 23:09:15,Unreliable delivery - no customer service,"This year, my husband threw me a surprise birthday party - we ordered a meal thru the app- it went thru but the progress bar was stuck for over 2 hours on the ‚Äúrestaurant is preparing your food‚Äù there was even a driver assigned to it - then the order was abruptly cancelled with no explanation - just the usual -we are sorry for your inconvenience- here‚Äôs a $5 credit towards your next meal- which you may or may not get - 
So here we were - no food - not enough money to order again - the credit back was slow to appear - since apparently 
I DMed them and posted on social media - they responded quickly - but only made things worse with that meaningless - ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre sorry we ruined your evening- here‚Äôs $5 - go away‚Äù then they just stopped responding 
Later I found out that the restaurant was closed that day -Uber eats stopped responding - 
Sorry but a $5 credit is not going to cut it here - they do not take any responsibility for their own errors - and you get no response - other than a canned reply  - I deleted the app",2
ubereats,1058959277,2022-11-29 03:51:19,DON‚ÄôT USE THIS!,"Gross, Awful, and unprofessional. I thought I liked the app at first, but the people who run it along with its drivers are AWFUL. A driver spat in my food after I already paid SEVEN dollars for a delivery fee. Was a $2 tip not enough? Sorry I didn‚Äôt tip to double the cost! When I went to report this order, I sent a complaint about the driver. After I sent this, I get a notification saying I tipped THE DRIVER almost $3. The same one who completely disrespected me. I didn‚Äôt know a complaint came with money attached?! They need an ACTUAL confirmation button with information on WHAT you‚Äôre doing. You can‚Äôt just charge for everything you press on your screen. Based on what you tip and how much you spend depends on how you get treated, whether your order comes triple the time after it said it would, and if you get your food hot or cold. And let us not forget that you can‚Äôt cancel your order once a driver picks it up. Well dang, I didn‚Äôt order an atrocious and slow delivery guy and I‚Äôm sure nobody else would. Disgusting, never again. It‚Äôs not worth your time or money. Watch out for ratchet people named Steven!",1
ubereats,1058959277,2022-12-19 00:13:34,Terrible customer service/illegal business practice,"Uber will actively try and bully you into not complaining if an order goes wrong. I‚Äôve had a terrible week with Uber having messed up items or finding multiple hairs in my food and customer support emailed sayin I might get banned from customer support claims??? First, why would I ever use this service again if that‚Äôs your attitude? Secondly, maybe do anything to actually improve the gig economy work flow and you‚Äôd have less mess ups. Third, Uber takes at least twice the amount for services than what the driver makes in a delivery fee. The driver also has to maintain the vehicle with gas, etc. Uber doesn‚Äôt feel like they deserve to be real humans so they give their drivers 0 worker rights. Uber is now back door punishing me for my support claims by making me wait hours for my food with no ability to cancel. Uber your trash and you‚Äôre never getting any of my money again.

Terrible app!!! They continually adjust the estimated delivery time so they‚Äôre not wrong. Paid for fast delivery and it still took a long long time for the food to get here.",1
ubereats,1058959277,2022-11-19 15:33:45,Worst Experience Ever,"Listen guys don‚Äôt waste your money on food deliveries it‚Äôs not worth it at the end of the day. Ever since I got this app I‚Äôve had one problem after another. They always get my order wrong or deliver my food to someone else, the drivers rarely at times check if they are even delivering to the right place to begin with. I on 3 occasions have gotten spoiled food and that‚Äôs including last night. I spent a total of 40hrs max trying to get refund and all the help I got was bot responses. I had proof of the inconveniences and they still denied to refund me because I wasn‚Äôt eligible even though I was eligible according to their guidelines. I fell sick to my stomach and I had to throw my food away. After fighting for so long I managed to get the attention of two supervisors and a manager, can y‚Äôall guess what they said? They all responded with the same bot messages lol, I was about to lose it. This company makes $57.6 Billion and they are fighting so hard on not refunding me my $36. Would you imagine if I ate more than I should‚Äôve of that spoiled food my accident and gotten food poisoning or something else?",1
ubereats,1058959277,2022-10-18 19:29:31,Absolutely lousy customer service‚Ä¶ And I am a gold member!,"update: I tip the driver five dollars cash and Uber eats felt that they had the right to put a four dollar tip on my credit card‚Ä¶ And two days later I am still waiting for customer service to remove that. Seriously? Avoid these losers at all costs! At first, I had a couple of great experiences until I didn‚Äôt! My orders were completely wrong and incomplete. They would forget the drinks or whatever. Then there were people delivering my food that were not the right driver etc. Finally, I complained and I was offered a $5 credit. The app would not allow me to use this credit and when I complained to customer service they ignored me! Yes, they are really truly rude and do not care a bit about customer service. You would think with all the fees they put on, they would care a little bit more about pleasing the customers like myself who is a gold member. But they do not! Just call the restaurant directly. You‚Äôll have better luck and save money. These guys will eventually just sell to DoorDash anyway because customer service is not where it‚Äôs at.",1
ubereats,1058959277,2022-12-10 05:20:39,My first app review ever.,As the title says this is my first time ever leaving a review here on the App Store. Do not waste ur money with uber eats. Delivery fees are true the roof. And you have to spend at least $15 bucks in order to get the ‚Äú0‚Äù delivery fees that the alleged to give you for signing up for a monthly membership yet the fees are rarely are zero. Granted they do bump it down a bit. But the false advertisement that Uber eats has going on is beyondDisgraceful. My main reason for writing this review or I guess I should say as I write this review. I have been waiting 45 minutes for an order that the app said would take 15-30 minutes. And the food will not be here for at least another 45 minutes. Disgraceful to say the least. I understand that your estimates are not going to be perfect but there is a big difference between 15 to 30 minutes in an hour and a half to two hours. I will be leaving Uber one once my pay period is up. And deleting the app. Do not waste ur time and money with these folks. But that‚Äôs just my opinions on this trash excuse of a professional company. Do what ya wants with the info,1
ubereats,1058959277,2022-12-10 22:13:22,Uber Eats App Meal Delivery Service,"I‚Äôve never used meal delivery services that I require a membership to be more affordable. But not having to leave my house to shop for groceries and then spend time and effort making meals has been surprisingly rewarding! Uber Eats has changed the way I feel about ‚Äúbeing too lazy‚Äù to do it myself, because the convenience is a justified reward for worn out full time workers, the elderly and disabled people. 

Ordering is SO easy, from a growing number of participating top fast food, healthy and top-notch restaurants. It IS a little pricier but the minimal extra cost is WELL WORTH IT! Average time from submitting an order to delivery at your door is about 20-35 minutes, or 40-50 during holiday seasons. And everything is hot, fresh and ready to serve. 

I‚Äôve been happy with this app‚Äôs service with only a couple rare exceptions: Twice my order was delivered to the wrong address, and a couple times they forgot to deliver the drinks on the order. However, with their excellent Customer Support, I was reimbursed for the entire order or the missing items.

This app is definitely worth checking out and is especially a life SAVER for working parents who just want time to unwind after a long day‚Äôs work without having to shop for groceries and cook. I highly recommend Uber Eats!

ubereats,1058959277,2022-11-10 12:53:07,Terrible service,"I used to use Uber and Uber Eats regularly. I work more locally now and do not need to get rides often anymore. Without the rewards program, don‚Äôt actually see any reason to choose Uber over a different service with cheaper pricing when I do need a ride. For Uber Eats, I‚Äôve been a loyal customer and even paid for Uber One (and before that, Uber Pass).  Out of all of the orders I have placed, only a small percentage has led to me requesting help. Unfortunately, most of the requests have been recent because my food keeps arriving incomplete. A couple of nights ago, I was missing some food so I put in a help ticket, only to be told that I didn‚Äôt qualify because of past requests. I wasn‚Äôt expecting a full refund, just for the missing item! Why am I being punished because a merchant didn‚Äôt care enough to check the order? Needless to say, I will be cancelling my Uber One subscription and switching to a different delivery service. This was the final straw in a long line of issues that has led me to this point.",2
ubereats,1058959277,2022-12-10 06:16:30,Have time on your hands,"This app likes to waste people‚Äôs time. Your order WILL take longer than they say almost guaranteed and on top of that they give you 3 different times. They will tell you 25 to 30 minutes when you are ordering and then give you an estimated arrival time 35 minutes from now. Then you will get a ‚Äúlatest arrival‚Äù time for an hour after you ordered. They say any order that arrives before this time is technically on time meaning as long as you get your order within a whole hour that‚Äôs fine with them. Idk about you but I dont like hour old food. But guess what happens when your order doesn‚Äôt make it within the hour. You would think a refund or some type of compensation but nope, they just push your latest arrival time back as if the last latest arrival time wasn‚Äôt supposed to be THE LATEST TIME YOUR FOOD WILL ARRIVE. Of course this comes complete with a notification letting you know the obvious that your stomach was probably telling you for an hour and a bogus apology. With all the time wasted on this app you‚Äôd be better off cooking.",1
ubereats,1058959277,2022-09-25 23:03:38,Horrible Customer Service-Losing a long time customer!,"I have had several interactions with the customer service department at Uber eats. They refuse to work with their customers when the customer and the delivery driver both acknowledge that the problem was originated on the restaurant‚Äôs end of the order. I have now been denied a refund on 2 separate occasions when a restaurant did not contact me when they were out of an item on my order (which the Uber eats guidelines specify they should do) and when I chose to cancel the order instead of accept it with an unwanted substitute, I am still charged! 

Not only am I irritated and frustrated by the lack of regard of company policy by its customer service department, I cannot even get a person on the phone to speak to! All of the customer service interactions are done by a chat feature on the app. I don‚Äôt want to chat with a computer , I want to speak to a real human!

Uber eats, you have lost a long time customer today! Shame on you for not hearing out the CRAP your customers are tolerating from some of your restaurant partners!",1
ubereats,1058959277,2022-10-29 08:45:41,So many scammers and Uber will side with them,"I am absolutely fed up with Uber Eats and the extremely scamming drivers on there. This is the second time a driver scammed me out of an order, and this, Uber sided with them and did not provide a refund at all. They told me I accepted full responsibility for where it was delivered, even though the driver never communicated with me at all and didn‚Äôt follow any of my instructions. I made a $25+ order and when it said the driver was ‚Äúdropping off‚Äù the food, he literally took a picture of a random street/side walk and said delivered. He basically stole my food and provided ‚Äúproof‚Äù with a random pic, because they know the representative are too incompetent to do anything as long as there‚Äôs a pic. I‚Äôm totally over it. I wish I could post screenshots too, just to show how messed up this company really is. Now I‚Äôm choosing to file suit at small claims court because this is completely unacceptable. They are basically getting away with stealing and I‚Äôm not standing for it. I don‚Äôt care how much money it is. Please just stay away from delivery apps, especially Uber Eats.",1
ubereats,1058959277,2022-10-12 00:17:29,Very Bad Experience,"We placed an order through Uber Eats. Having waited for over an hour, we found the order magically disappeared from the app, after it presented in the app during this hour. No notification has been sent to us about this in any forms, not to mention why this happened, at all. We had to reach out to customer service, and then found that the customer service number is also not available in the app. We googled it, found it, called. The customer service associate told us there should have been notifications, and this might be an technical issue. I explained my disappointment about no communications, and she offered to send me an email notifying this after the call and suggested to place another order with the app. She also confirmed all they can offer is an apology and a refund. The former doesn‚Äôt resolve anything, the latter should naturally happen anyway. We totally understand that things happen, but this was how this was handled throughout the process when things happen with this app and company. You all should be aware of this.",1
ubereats,1058959277,2022-12-19 19:19:05,Never got my order and have to call back later for a refund??,"Worst food delivery service, will never use Uber Eats again. Placed an order for lunch and delivery est said 25-30 mins. Waited over an hour for the delivery driver to arrive only to find out he did not have the order at all. ‚ÄúSomeone else picked up your order‚Äù Because we gave him our PIN number, we could not submit a complaint through the app (the automated response was ‚Äúyou gave your driver the pin, enjoy your food!‚Äù Wish I could, but it never came! So we tracked down the customer service number to speak to a real person and get our money back. They called the driver to find out what happened but could not get a hold of him. The rep offered to give us a full refund but said we would have to call them back after our credit card payment has fully processed, in 1 to 2 days. Why can‚Äôt you just void the credit card transaction? Why did the driver come all the way to our house just to tell us he didn‚Äôt have it, and then collect the pin so we could not cancel the order? Scam!",1
ubereats,1058959277,2022-10-06 21:53:20,Worst delivery ever,Thanks to chat team member Mariana P. I wont order Uber for a month from today. Because my orders arrived damaged and incomplete from the grocery store after I bought nice hot pizza half hour earlier with the Uber eats app. I provided picture of what was received and even found a recipt in the bag proving thus more nearly half menu items were just not there . Secondly my milk came damaged and not fit for consumption a store Isn‚Äôt allowed to sell bashed products . Milk is something ingested of all ages. Mariana a uber representative said there was nothing she could do as a chat customer service member and just write a review and they will learn. They won‚Äôt take it back and nor is this a joke so the items are being thrown out and I will be taking my car and capable body for food and grocery‚Äôs now . Mariana as the front face of Uber did absolutely nothing to resolve the issue but sent me to rate my experience. Don‚Äôt let a big day ruined shop the day before and schedule food day before also . Comes to my realization now . Bless everyone these are the facts of using the app.,1

ubereats,1058959277,2022-11-12 02:31:59,: /,"Supposedly, they allow you to order in advance for up to a week. However, without notice, they canceled ALL of my upcoming orders, and pretended that something was wrong with my debit card, totally freaking me out. However, what had actually happened was they didn‚Äôt like it that I ordered the exact same meal for every day, so they just decided to cancel them. I tried a different restaurant and they also pretended like something was wrong with my debit card. When in reality, my debit card has now apparently been BANNED from UberEats, all because they don‚Äôt approve of me ordering the exact same meal every day. I immediately went to DoorDash, and was able to place an order, no problem. In other words, literally NOTHING is wrong with my card. I have since made other purchases elsewhere as well without problems. Again, NOTHING is wrong with my card. Needless to say, I have since deleted the UberEats app. Also, since I could never get a fully straight answer, the restaurant in question is called El Castillo. I am now COMPLETELY DONE with them as well. That is all.",1
ubereats,1058959277,2022-11-24 04:57:35,Seriously?,"My Uber Eats Driver was 5 min from my house (according to the app) when it was cancelled. I even texted her prior to her arrival to give specific landmarks, and description of the house WITH ALL THE LIGHTS ON. I was cancelled about 30 seconds later. 
I have never been so disappointed in Uber Eats. The rain was NOT a factor, I was outside myself working and it was a light sprinkle. 
I expect a call, an email, anything to explain why my daughter had to wait an additional hour by ordering through DoorDash. I was partial to Uber Eats and just signed up for the monthly charge for whatever promo y‚Äôall were offering. I feel quite sure I will be cancelling. That was ridiculous. We had already been waiting over 40 min and for her to decide she didn‚Äôt want to deliver seemed irrational. I‚Äôm a surgical transplant nurse for a major hospital in FTW. Next time one of our surgeons or vendors wants to treat us to lunch, I‚Äôll vote Door Dash. It‚Äôs a shame bc prior to this, Uber Eats would have been my vote. I expect to see my refund in the AM considering it occurred PRIOR to the holiday and I paid $60+ for two entrees.",1

We had to have a reorder because it wasn‚Äôt telling the drivers our house number so the first driver just left our order at a random house even though the box of food they were delivering had the full address with house number on it. On the redelivery, same issue happened but the delivery driver very rudely told me that I need to make sure I put my house address in so he‚Äôs not wasting his gas trying to find the house since they barely pay enough to cover the gas. When I explained that I had indeed put the house number in and he should talk to the company since clearly there‚Äôs an issue on their end not giving the drivers the house number. He told me I sound confused and must have put it in the wrong place and I should be grateful he even decided to deliver it to us as most people don‚Äôt deliver to our area. I think we‚Äôll be deleting this app and sticking with the other companies from now on.",1

I should be applauding their customer care and service for that, but instead it has completely ruined my experience with Uber Eats. Whenever I press checkout, I get an error message that says ‚ÄúThe promotion you applied couldn‚Äôt be processed‚Äù and cancels my checkout. Since this promo was a part of the new account process, I can‚Äôt take it off and thus can‚Äôt order.

I‚Äôve reached out twice to customer support about this, and both times been told there‚Äôs nothing they can do, and that they are referring me to someone else over email. That email has never come. It boggles my mind this company is ok with only disrespecting their customer‚Äôs time and money. I even asked if I could just take the free delivery off and spend MORE money and that‚Äôs also not possible.

I waited and waited for an email that never came and ended up going to bed hungry. If that doesn‚Äôt speak volumes for their values, I don‚Äôt know what else I could say to change your mind.l",1
ubereats,1058959277,2022-11-24 00:50:57,Worst App Ever,"Between UberEats & DoorDash, UberEats has been the worst app. I‚Äôm constantly missing items from my order every single time but this time was my last straw. I place an order and was waiting forever for it. I could‚Äôve drove myself to the location and got the items myself but I wanted something convenient due to me not feeling too good and needing some items to help with my pain. 
I contact support the first time to ask them if it could be canceled and support tells me delivery is taking too long due to it being busy today and not a lot of drivers on the road. 
So when I contacted support a second time to cancel my order, the person tells me to wait until the store closes and if no movement then they will refund me. Refunds take 5-10 business days so not only did I spend money for no reason, i have to get up and go to the store and spend EXTRA money just to get what I need when I could‚Äôve done this in the first place.

It started with a mess up here and there but now every single order I have placed in the past 4 months has had either missing food, canceled after an hour, or delivered to a completely different place. They used to atleast refund your money right away but now it will either take 10 business days or it can be credited it back to your account which only helps if you can afford to pay for you meal twice (or sometimes 3 times) initially and then be credited back your money. I kid you not - I had to spend $80 for a single burrito because the drivers kept messing it up. I‚Äôd be more understanding if I hadn‚Äôt used this as well as a driver and know how easy it is to double check yourself. With all the different delivery apps nowadays - I‚Äôd save yourself the money and frustration and use someone else with better standards.",1

But what I hate about it is how it tries to obscure you from the true cost. First when you‚Äôre adding items to a card, it only shows you the cart total. Then in the checkout, it actually shows you the cost with fees. What‚Äôs the point of showing me the cart total if that total has no bearing on what I  actually pay? Then, only after you finally completed the last step of the check out, do they ask you for the tip. They base the tip on the entire order cost including all of their fees. And then when you select the tip at no point do they show you what the total is with both your order and the tip.

They try hard to make sure you don‚Äôt actually realize the true cost. Of course this is what all apps in the industry. But I do find it very frustrating. I wish they would be more upfront about the true cost.",3

Before and when I hit the cancel button, the app did not say I would still be charged if I cancel the order.  I was told that I have been be charged of $147 after the cancellation was completed.  I contacted their customer service right away and asked the representative to reinstate my order if the restaurant had already prepared my order.  However, the customer service lady came back and told me that they are unable to reinstate my order nor issue me the refund.  I called the restaurant too but the restaurant told me that since I canceled the order, they will not be paid by Uber.  In other words, Uber stole my money without fulfill my order nor paid the restaurant. I am going to file a class lawsuit against them because I believe this is not legit.  The customer service rep said the manager will contact when I requested to escalate this issue but they never did.  Stay away from UberEats!",1

Today my order (which was medicine I could not go get) was delivered to the wrong address, the picture of the delivery showed it was not my house and I didn‚Äôt have the items on my porch. I spoke with 2 customer service reps and they both argued with me and said it was delivered to the correct address. It was NOT. Literally standing on my porch arguing with a rep who said it‚Äôs there! They were insistent on not refunding then ended the chat. I am beyond frustrated. I wound up calling and a refund issued, minus the tip which is a joke since it‚Äôs the drivers error. Whatever. Never using this service again. Mistakes happen and I get that, but don‚Äôt argue with me telling me my order was there when it wasn‚Äôt. Get better GPS for your drivers, or have the drivers actually answer your call when you call them, as the driver declined my call.

It took three times for me to be able to use my gift card, the first two times I tried to order breakfast at dunkin, and then again tried to order lunch at Bolay and it kept telling me to remove the promotion from the order. The promotion it was talking about was because I just signed up and gave me free deliveries for a month.  There was no option to remove this anywhere.

Finally the restaurant I chose to use this time had an option to have it delivered directly to me so I paid my delivery fee and  then it allowed me to use a gift card and place my order. I honestly was so frustrated with this app and the whole situation not being able to remove the promotion uber gave me, That I didn‚Äôt even add it to my order.

They have devolved into the single worst company I can think of based on customer experience. They‚Äôre genuinely horrible.

Their drivers never check order accuracy, so it‚Äôs often wrong, has missing items, etc. Uber support tells me that ‚Äúdue to my refund and adjustment history‚Äù they can‚Äôt issue any type of refunds any more. ‚ÄúA significant number of refunds or adjustments‚Äù reflects poorly on Uber Eats and their quality of service, not on my account history or trustworthiness. I submit images when I have an issue ‚Äî there‚Äôs literally photographic proof of what happened. My integrity is not in question, and to insinuate that I am being dishonest is deeply offensive.

Perhaps Uber should be more concerned with improving their order accuracy, drivers, and truly terrible customer service. It would be a better use of their time, rather than blaming customers for their issues.

Whatever the competition is, they can‚Äôt be worse than Uber.

‚Äî

A final thought: looking through these reviews, I can‚Äôt help but be suspicious that there are so many reviews that show 5 stars but describe horribly negative experiences. Given how untrustworthy this company is, it‚Äôs not a good look.",1
ubereats,1058959277,2022-11-22 02:32:19,Terrible Customer service,"Experienced total dissatisfaction with the whole app and services. I did not appreciate the way in which their customer service rep implied dishonest behavior on my part. There had been a 3 separate incidents back to back in which errors were made to my orders. As expected I‚Äôd reported those issues and the first 2 times they‚Äôd issues a refund. And although the refund is great it still did not make up for a total waste of time and a complete let down when the food I expected to received was not delivered as expected. However on the last reported issue, not only was I denied a refund but my issue was not taken seriously. I had picture evidence of the fact that I received 2 orders that were wrong. In addition, one pint of ice cream was missing it‚Äôs safety seal. The customer reps just kept saying that my ‚Äúrefund activity‚Äù did not allow for a refund. In addition they just said to rate the merchant directly so that those issues could be avoid in the future. I‚Äôd highly advice not to use this app!",1
ubereats,1058959277,2022-10-31 00:23:49,Looking for the worst food delivery experience possible? Look no further!,"An app and a company that actively lie to their customers, pay their delivery people as poorly as everyone else - all while lining their grubby little Silicon Valley pockets and delivering little to no value.

I‚Äôve confirmed (multiple times) with both restaurants and delivery people that Uber Eats, as mentioned in others‚Äô reviews, ‚Äúdispatches‚Äù delivery people (they actually choose whether or not to show up and often don‚Äôt) to the restaurant at their whim and with no relation to when diners‚Äô food is actually ready.

Curious, then, that the app will say, the restaurant is ‚Äúwrapping up your order,‚Äù when nothing could be further from the truth.

Last night was the final straw, as I placed my initial order circa 8:30p. Uber Eats then sent a delivery person to the restaurant who opted to stay there for approximately 10 seconds (before the kitchen could get to food out to him, he‚Äôd left) and canceled the order. No text notification or call; just an email that showed up 15 minutes later.

I was able to resubmit the order so fortunately my food wasn‚Äôt tossed, but 90 minutes later - after having spoken directly *with* the kitchen, who confirmed my food had been ready since shortly after 8:30 and had been *closed* for the past 45 minutes - guess what Uber Eats was claiming as to the status of my food?

Yup. The closed-for-an-hour kitchen was ‚Äúwrapping up‚Äù my order.

Anything to say for yourselves, Uber Eats?",1
ubereats,1058959277,2022-11-18 04:54:15,Worse Membership Treatment,"I order through this app at least 2 times a day. Usually I have no issue but when I do have an issue, they have very bad customer service. I had an order that got delayed 3 times. From 8:15 to 8:30 to 8:45 to then 9.

When I complained about the delayed order the customer service would not even acknowledge that the order is late. After repeating multiple times they offered me $5 for compensation. How is that ok? I should just be happy with $5? No apology, no acceptance of responsibility and no respect for my time? How is that fair to someone who is a member and orders daily?

There is no option to make complaints and the customer reps would not let me escalate the issue to a complaint. There is no option at all. Absolutely horrible service. I discontinued my membership at that point because it really gives me no value. It's not about just the money but customers want to know they are valued. Specially when they have been loyal to you for years. ABSOLUTELY HORRIBLE SERVICE. 

Since I cannot make any impact in their business, because there is no option for anyone to make a formal complaint, I decided to write this review, hoping they change. They used to be good and trustworthy but not anymore.

I hope you have a better experience than I did, sincerely! Best of luck but I am out. I will keep looking for an app that actually treats their customers right.",2

The company needs a over hauling in its management department because they should be ashamed of taking people‚Äôs money when they screw up. Grub-hub is a complete rip off tho takes 3hrs to get a Order or half if it‚Äôs missing or someone‚Äôs else and it‚Äôs cold from being last on there 30 person delivery. So thank you Uber drivers you deserve more respect because you guys are why I choose Uber eats. Sure isn‚Äôt the crooks running it sad sad sad people they must be to be okay of ripping ya off with there ‚Äúpolicy‚Äù on order details. Offer no apology or refund nothing but oops to late or we can‚Äôt do anything but we‚Äôre keeping your money. Yeah your just lack of options Uber eats.

When I order a meal, a missing drink could ruin everything and it happens all the time. Missing drinks, missing utensils, damaged containers, etc.. They also don‚Äôt honor the deals that the restaurant is running. Every time I order through Uber eats it feels like crap shoot on weather my order will be right or not, it‚Äôs very annoying. I use to order through Uber eats all the time, like a couple times a week but after so many issues I stopped using them as much. Now I only use it when I absolutely have to like today and guess what?

Usually comes as a wrap with either no sauce or regular. Dont order the extra sauces like ranch or what ever from anywhere because it is a 50/50 youll get it. Uber IS good at giving you the change back though. Again i dont THIIIINK its the restaurant, i dont ever blame a driver. But how the app is set up and reports orders, gottta be a problem.

Weeks have past and I figured I‚Äôd try again after seeing a new $30 promo. To no prevail, it still is not working.

The second one told me the same copy/paste nonsense the first one did. When I asked for a supervisor they stated that they were the highest level of support and kept refusing to assist me in just simply adding my card to just buy food. Ya know.

ubereats,1058959277,2022-10-10 19:28:49,Worst Customer Experience Ever,I created an order and after waiting 20 minutes it was canceled and it said due to an issue with the restaurant. So then I re-ordered waited a couple minutes and thought better of it and canceled and decided to call the restaurant. Then I got a message from Uber eats that they were charging me for the full amount because the restaurant had already started the order. So I called the restaurant and he said no they hadn‚Äôt even gotten the order or started it. So I called Uber eats customer support let them know that and she said that she would help me and then she put me on a hold so she could call the restaurant and confirm then she got back to me and said the system would not allow her to process my refund even though the restaurant had not started on it yet and that that‚Äôs just the way that it was going to be. She apologized and said there was nothing she could do. Absolutely ridiculous the worst experience I‚Äôve ever had and I will never use Uber eats again.,1

Talked to driver. He said I delivered it, it was the house with the gravel path. I said not our house. I asked driver if he read the extra instructions I put in the app. Driver said I never read those and then hung up or call was disconnected. Called thru to driver again. Straight to his VM. Left message. He never returned the call. Texted customer support. Person kept telling me it was delivered and sorry this wasn‚Äôt the support decision I hoped for but nothing they could do. Asked to talk to a more senior support member because this decision made no sense. Same response. Frustrating as can be. Cost me $50. 2 days later our neighbor delivered to our front door. Clearly he delivered somewhere else. Surprised years of use and no customer support interactions like this mattered not at all. Definitely done with UberEats and Uber. Time to move on. Something changed there in their support.",1

I get that it‚Äôs not necessarily Uber‚Äôs fault if the restaurant messes up, but I expect Uber to take care of an issue with the restaurant should an issue arise. For the most part, Uber Eats has had decent customer service. However, I‚Äôve noticed the past couple of times when I‚Äôve had issues, the customer service agents have been less than helpful. They won‚Äôt respond for hours, then when they do respond they simply offer a $5 Uber Eats cash credit. My last order for example, the restaurant forgot 2 separate items, & the 2 items I did receive - the first item was gross & soggy & the 2nd item was missing half of the item (burger but didn‚Äôt have any sauce, any toppings or any cheese). Uber eats simply said here‚Äôs a $5 Uber Eats credit, even though that didn‚Äôt even cover the cost of the missing items, much less the rest of the messed up & nasty order.

I go to pay and my first card won‚Äôt work. Says t try a new one. Second card doesn‚Äôt work try a new one. Third card doesn‚Äôt work so I switch to Apple Pay and use the first card I tried on Apple Pay and it works. Also it took me almost 30 minutes to order because I kept having to retype everything and couldn‚Äôt pay. It‚Äôs bad business to make it so difficult to get food. Honestly if I wasn‚Äôt so tired from traveling and hungry and since I have no other options I wouldn‚Äôt be using Uber at all if I had another option.

ubereats,1058959277,2022-10-24 21:30:12,Overpriced food that is always wrong - use another app,"I can‚Äôt remember the last time I got an order that was completely correct. My order is wrong pretty much every single time, and it‚Äôs wrong in infuriating ways. You only get refunded a small percentage when there are missing items, so be prepared to pay even more on top of the apps already high price hikes. Drivers also hardly ever deliver to my place despite clear instructions. This is an overpriced and difficult experience and it‚Äôs probably better to use a different delivery app.

UPDATE (10/24): I am officially done with this app and it is clear that they treat everyone ‚Äî customers, drivers, and restaurants ‚Äî terribly while reaping huge profits. Recently, I ordered from a restaurant the following items: a side item that came with a side of sauce, lo mein, potstickers, and a drink. Guess what came? Only the side order, but with no sauce. And the won‚Äôt refund me. Tons of money down the drain.

ubereats,1058959277,2022-12-01 01:54:49,Needs to work on driver acceptance rates/ out of radius,"There is no reason why a driver should be able to accept an order and then go on about their business completely out off the way of the restaurant that they accepted the order for. I placed an order for a fast food restaurant that is less than 10mins away. The driver proceeded to accept the order, drive past the restaurant, and then drive 20+ mins away from the area before heading BACK towards the restaurant to pick up the order. I understand that there a surely a shortage of drivers, but a driver should not be able to accept an order and then drive x amount of miles away from the restaurant and delivery area. The order should be able to be accepted by someone else if a driver proceeds out of a certain radius, if they have not actually picked up the order from the restaurant yet.",3

The app told me I could leave a message, yet repeated calls just disconnected me. My internet/phone signal was strong, so it wasn‚Äôt that. My order status switched to ‚Äúdelivered‚Äù, yet the food was never delivered. The driver simply wouldn‚Äôt answer their phone, and the app gave me no way to actually contact a human being.

For example, I placed an order with a merchant and realized I had a wrong item, so I canceled the order within seconds after placing it. I then proceeded to place another order with the same merchant. Uber charged me for both orders even though I received only one. I understand if there is a cancel fee, but it should equate to the full amount of the order. This is an extremely poor policy. If Uber is still going to charge for the full amount, the ‚Äúcancel‚Äù icon should not even be an option. I do not understand why this is. It would be logical to deliver the customers canceled order if the customer will charged for that order either way.

I heard the driver filing a complaint with Uber after she spilled Ofer half of the drink on her seats.

All Uber is concerned is cutting their losses. Out of the three orders to the same place I made that day, only two of them made it to my door, and only one wasn‚Äôt spilled.

ubereats,1058959277,2022-10-17 15:18:14,Runs the app using a 'Hands-Off' approach,"Nine times out of ten, you'll receive your meal lukewarm. Unlike most food delivery services, Uber Eats does not require an insulated delivery bag. It is only a suggestion, but ultimately up to the driver. This is a major food safety issue.

You should also make sure you're alright with giving your driver either a thumbs up or thumbs down. There is no way to rate specific aspects of the meal, star amounts, or even provide a description. Drivers who have an interest in improving their delivery quality have no clue how to do so without feedback. 

Theres also increased charges, more than the usual rate of the restaurant if you were to order directly. A $14 meal cost nearly twice as much after all the fees. You need to stay vigilant because if youre not careful, they will take money out from under you.

Lastly, if you have an issue with an order, just consider it a loss. Customer service will only feed you pre-written lines, sometimes giving you 'help' that doesn't even apply to your issue. And thats if they even choose to respond. 

I tried uber eats once before, and only tried it again so i could use some of my uber rewards. Yeah.. Not doing that again. Order directly through the restaurant if they offer delivery, and if not, use anything BUT uber eats.",1

Most drivers will cancel on deliveries to high population areas, even though the service charge can go up to 15 dollars. If I were them I‚Äôd take that 15 dollars happily and deliver to even the most complicated residences. But why do they still cancel? Because Uber takes ridiculous amount of cut. They even take a cut from the restaurant itself. This is the most shameful and the most shady business practice I‚Äôve ever seen in my life and I have no idea why people continue to use this god forsaken app. Do America a favor and delete this app.

Not only that, customer service agent has been replaced by bots. I beg you people, just don‚Äôt use this service.",1

I am livid at this point that someone would say they deliver food and has probably just kept it for themselves which is why they didn‚Äôt leave a photo or anything! Upon calling support they told me the couldn‚Äôt confirm with the driver that the order was delivered nor could they process a refund because I requested a refund for over cooked food in the past. I am extremely upset as I spent my last $20 to feed my children and myself and they don‚Äôt even offer the common courtesy of redelivery as I am NOT asking for a refund. DO NOT use this app I now have no food and no money left to order dinner‚Ä¶ I am disgusted by my treatment!,1

Now, I have come to expect cold food arriving moments before, or even after the maximum time suggested.  This is still the case if I‚Äôve paid more for a direct delivery. It could be driver related, but I don‚Äôt believe that is the case.  The app asks you to tip in advance on the total amount including taxes and fees versus the order itself.  If the app is set up to tip just like the Uber drivers taking passengers, maybe Uber would realize a change should be made to their process.  I‚Äôm frustrated when I give a decent tip at the beginning and get a cold & nearly late food order nearly every time.  I‚Äôve stopped using Uber Eats when I‚Äôm hungry or in somewhat of a time crunch.",3

My food takes hours to arrive, once it arrives I discover the driver stuck their hands in there , sometimes they over schedule pick ups. They pay zero to no attention to the time frames they provide. Many hidden fees. I get all kinds of notifications saying I‚Äôll get this or that discount / offer / special etc. All to end up paying the exact same. 
Today I reached out to try to see if they wanted to redeem themselves for all the trouble I‚Äôve gone through for years, and they said it wasn‚Äôt  approved. Ok, bye! Never ever using this service again.

I went to pick up the food and got home a ate some fries it was cold and nasty by then, my bread was also cold and my veggie platter was cold leaving me to throw it all away. I msg support about a refund but they said it‚Äôs nothing they can do. That is unfair and cheated out of money because if u guys at the time didn‚Äôt have a driver, I should have been received notification to just pick the food up instead. I already had to wait 45 minutes then drive 20 minutes to get the food and 20 minutes back home. You guys have the audacity to tell me I can‚Äôt get my money back.",1

We proceeded to place the correct order to which the driver cancelled on us. The 19 dollars was refunded however the first order of 30 they refuse and then this morning I woke to find they had taken another random 18 dollars out of my account. This is the second time they keep charging us randomly. The first time I was resolved and they were the kind the second time the help line basically said you should have contacted us that night sorry there is nothing else we can do and would not further explain why we were charged three different times for food we did not get. This is the second time they have done this to us. Watch your account because they seem to make random charges.,1

I was frustrated and canceled my order because the food was nowhere close to being ready. When I contacted support regarding the issue they refused to give me a refund even though I recieved no food or service. $40 they stole from me after lying to me about my order being ready. I will never use Eats or any Uber service again because of how appalled I was at the lack of customer service regarding this issue. I had been an active Uber customer for 8 years, and even paid for their premium service Uber One.

Lo and behold, It was sitting in front of my neighbors house! I checked the option where it allows you to just click on ‚Äúcurrent location‚Äù and it picked up my next door neighbors house‚Ä¶Fix this problem dammit! If this was to happen to someone else, the people next door wouldve claimed the food and blame would‚Äôve been on the person who ordered for not checking the delivery address.

I noticed the app was still connected to my old address. I have never used the app before but wanted to give it a try today since I am sick and needed food brought to me. Even after changing my address and getting everything sorted. It changed drivers more than 4 times and I got my food about 45 minutes later. Cold, nasty, and stale. Usually I‚Äôm not one to complain but I felt like I was being ripped off. Instead of a refund I got half the price worth of app credit so I can use their app again. It‚Äôs a very slimy business that just wants to take advantage of you like most other big corporations. I‚Äôm very disappointed in the outcome that I had with this company.",1

THATS not even the worst part. When I called customer service (multiple times), they sent me to automated voice recording and when I was able to talk to a real person, they told me I was not eligible for a refund due to ‚Äútoo many refund requests‚Äù when I had never made one in the past. When I asked to give me dates of these so called refund requests, they would not. Moral of this is I spent over 100$ for food since Uber eats upcharges, and has a tip fee, and i had to order all new food since my order never arrived. 
I was absolutely horrified by the way the delivery driver treated me and how the company has treated me.",1

He just drove away with my food to a stranger!. Please be mindful who you handed your food!. I‚Äôm working overtime for 16hrs for a double shift and I‚Äôm too tired to go to a restaurant so I decided to use Uber eats, but Uber Eats drivers makes me starved and makes me delete this app and never use this anymore.

When I called the restaurant directly(there appears to be no way to call Uber Eats directly), I was told that quite often Uber drivers pickup the order then fail to deliver and keep it for themselves.

This order would come out to 50$‚Ä¶ Not only that, They tell you an ETA but food doesn‚Äôt arrive for 2 hours later even when it says being picked up or on the way without stops. This app is no longer good and is a vampire to money, use DoorDash or get the food yourself. App has too many issues, drivers smell like weed and smoke, untrust worthy. Safety is not important, food is always smashed or spilled. Restaurants do not secure your food safely, poisoning for food has happened and drugged. I high advise not to use Uber eats anymore.",1
ubereats,1058959277,2022-11-05 17:29:24,Do Not Use UberEats,"The restaurant doesn‚Äôt start making your food until a driver confirms the order. But if the driver cancels, your food can sit for a very long time before another driver confirms it. That being said, my food arrived 30 minutes later than expected, and it was cold. To top it off, the new driver completely ignored instructions. 

This morning, I also found out they charge an authorization hold. If I didn‚Äôt have a little extra money in my account, I could have been charged an overdraft fee because I‚Äôm struggling financially right now. The only reason why I ordered in the first place was because I had $30 off and figured that‚Äôs how I‚Äôd feed myself this week, but I found out it was for delivery only. The delivery fees and additional fees are more expensive than the other popular food delivery apps. And their tipping range is so weird (like 9% or 11%).",1

He asked to look at the store address on the receipt that he‚Äôd figure it out. 5 minutes later, he knocks on my door and says he can‚Äôt find the store address online and to just contact customer service for a refund. Are you kidding me?  It took 20 minutes to correspond with customer service in a selective one-way text. I had only one opportunity to write my issue. Good thing I‚Äôm a person of many words and details! I want that driver‚Äôs tip back too.

Ever since they bought Door Dash they‚Äôve figured that they own enough of the market they can price gouge us. The sad part is the driver gets a tiny percentage. Also the prices are higher than at the restaurant yet the restaurant actually gets paid less when someone uses Uber Eats. Google how much their drivers make and what amount the restaurants get paid and compare it to what you pay. I‚Äôll be using other services or picking up my food until Uber eats pays their drivers fairly, the small businesses get a fair cut, and they stop price gouging consumers at the same time. Go to specific restaurants websites/app and see if you can order. You‚Äôll save money plus the small business and the driver will make more!",1

I tried to get in contact with my driver about a missing item after waiting much longer than I should have and he wouldn‚Äôt answer. Then I tried to get ahold of Uber Eats about the missing item and only was able to submit a complaint with no hope for resolution. It used to be much easier to resolve these issues, but it seems like they don‚Äôt even have a chat function for customer support anymore.

There‚Äôs an existent business model built into this already, that every 17 year old with a second honda and a desire to earn money has figured out for the last 50 years. Explicitly stated, your customer base is interested in exchanging money for food, delivered in a timely manner. There‚Äôs really no need to introduce customer-adverse complications. I‚Äôm available for consulting if you need a picture drawn.

And stop adding single percentages to a tip already based on your garbage fees, rather than the food totals. You think no one‚Äôs going to notice that 21% is the new 20%? How long do you think that will work? Is this really better than remunerating your drivers? Lame scam behavior. Be better.",1

I just had to watch my neighbor wait over 2 hours past her estimated delivery for her driver (who had their phone off) to finally mark it ‚Äúdelivered‚Äù. 15 til midnight and she is having a borderline blood sugar crisis, and I‚Äôm having to drive to Taco Bell because the original restaurant (BJs) is closed.

I have even tipped someone who had a horrible delivery and they told me they could not take the tip back because it had been past the 3 hour time frame but I reported straight after the delivery. The fact that drivers can see if you tip or not ahead of time says it all. Uber is ridiculous especially if you pay for a membership and receive mediocre customer service.

Do yourself a favor and do NOT use Uber eats. My father died recently and I simply needed food delivered, as I was too depressed to go out. 

I paid extra for ‚Äúpriority delivery‚Äù so my food would arrive at ‚Äò6:20pm latest‚Äô according to the app. At 6:50pm I start getting upset as my order was now over 30+ minutes late. 

Why did I pay extra money for ‚Äúpriority delivery‚Äù to have my food delivered much later than the advertised time? I then tried getting connected to support to be refunded the ‚Äúpriority delivery‚Äù cost, since that was false advertising. I asked to speak to the manager and was disconnected from TWO extremely unhelpful customer service reps. The second one was named pranveet, I believe. Both reps said they would send me an email so I could file my claim. 

Neither of them ever sent me an email. Staff was lazy; they lacked basic compassion and effort. Because of 
A) False Advertising and 
B) Unhelpful and Lazy Staff 
I immediately deleted my Uber Eats app. I will NEVER use it again and would NEVER willingly give my business to such a dishonest company. 

DoorDash & Postmates treat customers with a much higher level of respect and integrity. I highly suggest going that route instead of being scammed by UberEats. Your choice.",1

Hopefully my bank provides better support I have discontinued use of this trash service and hope more will report their discrepancies and so the same. I had to pay money but they don‚Äôt have to provide anything.

ubereats,1058959277,2022-10-17 00:55:02,"Really bad service, no way to remove tip, cold pizza and no refund","Uber Eats customer service and delivery is overpriced and horrible.

Our estimated arrival time and ""latest arrival times"" kept changing further and further back. We finally contacted customer service, who apologized for our order being delayed, and offered to cancel it or at least partial refund.

Then the system kicked us out.  Delivery guy chose to pick up an extra delivery even though the delivery was listed as delayed, didn't show up for another 20 minutes, and the pizza was cold.

On hold the entire time to reconnect to an agent.

First thing from the new agent ""Sorry for the wait, our system keeps rebooting""...so he knows it's kicking people out.

Despite that, he then says ""The pizza arrived when it was supposed to. I'm sorry it's cold but in accorance with our policy it is not eligible for a refund.""

When I told him we were in the middle of being refunded by ""Dennis"" the first customer service agent, he said ""Nope, that's not possible."" And hung up on us.

Waiting 2 hours for cold pizza to arrive and then being treated this badly--I'm baffled by their high rating here on Apple apps--their Facebook rating is in the one-star. We won't be ordering with them again.",1
ubereats,1058959277,2022-10-05 21:26:03,Tipping Issue,"Uber eats has a ridiculous policy where you must tip before you receive your food. They no longer give you the option to change the tip after you receive the food. The only purpose of tipping is to reward good service. But if the service is bad, you cannot change the tip. This is absurd. If you don‚Äôt tip when you place the order it is likely that no Uber eats driver will pick it up. This is because they are able to choose jobs based off of the tip amount. This results in an obscene amount of wasted food being thrown out because it was not delivered. This also hurts Uber because customers demand cash back. I have no clue why Uber eats would implement this policy. Tips are meant to reward good service. You can‚Äôt anticipate whether your service will be good or not. Please revert this Uber. Allow editing tips again.",1

Uber eats wasn‚Äôt accepting none of my payment methods so I bought a gift card to try to use to pay for the food now it‚Äôs not even allowing me to use that. I contacted Uber and all Uber could do for me was transfer me to a ‚Äúspecialized team‚Äù which they have no idea how long it can take to even get the problem situated. They wouldn‚Äôt even offer me a refund for a gift card that I can‚Äôt use. For some reason the app isn‚Äôt working on my phone. That‚Äôs alright though I will call every single day until my situation is resolved. So great of a company to offer this kind of solution and steal 25 dollars from me rather then offering me my refund due to the fact that I can‚Äôt even use the gift card.

if you don‚Äôt want to require a tip from customers, maybe consider giving up a small percentage of fees you take and using that money to increase the minimum pay per delivery for drivers. it would also be nice if you did more of those events where you earn $5 extra for every 3 deliveries, etc.",3

The ‚Äúsupport‚Äù is non existent. My orders have been messed up multiple times but when you contact support you could be waiting up to 3-4 DAYS for a response. Then when you get the response they ask for information that you would‚Äôve had 3 DAYS ago (which was not asked for at the time of the original claim) but now you don‚Äôt so they throw you 5 dollars in Uber cash and say F off for a 45 dollar order that was ruined or wrong.

When I am paying a delivery fee and other stops are added after my order is placed, i should not have to foot the bill for someone else‚Äôs delivery or my order should at least be delivered first! I have been using Uber eats for YEARS very very often (even had the special membership at one point) and am so sick of these issues coming up so frequently.

They either never delivered it and I would always have to get a refund and wait again for my food to be redelivered or they delivered it to the wrong address and I would have to go look for it which would be housed away. By the time I would get there the food would be eaten by the people there and would again have to reorder.

I asked to speak to a supervisor after multiple times asking how much the refund was for and another agent entered the chat and said that a supervisor wouldn‚Äôt be available for 2 hours.

In the last year or two the prices have gotten a bit out of hand. It‚Äôs hard to justify paying $25 for $8 worth of McDonald‚Äôs. The service is also inconsistent - I have had orders with and estimated delivery time of 30 min take an hour and a half to be delivered (cold food). I‚Äôve had courier cancel after picking up my food. I‚Äôve had drivers ignore the delivery instructions and leave food on the sidewalk in front of my apartment building. Other times the food gets delivered quickly. Also there is little recourse if your order is wrong or missing items.,3

They offered me $2 when it was a $47 meal. There won‚Äôt be a next time. I have had this happen on DoorDash where I didn‚Äôt receive my food and they gave my my money back immediately plus credit. I highly recommend using DoorDash over Uber eats. It‚Äôs insane how this many people have problems after reading your reviews and you haven‚Äôt fixed your customer service.

I just wanted to go get something else at that point and do it myself but ofc I couldn‚Äôt because you have to wait 30 minutes to get it canceled and the timer resets after people decide they want to go get it. This loop has really agitated me and I think I‚Äôll be my own driver from now on‚Ä¶",1
ubereats,1058959277,2022-11-05 19:46:08,General review,"I use Uber Eats all the time. I gave it 4/5 simply depending on the driver. If your order doesn‚Äôt arrive or an item is missing you can call Uber and they will refund the money spent on the order or item. Also messaging your driver is useful. Especially if you requested some thing specific or have had missing items from a certain restaurant. Uber Eats can be pricy at times, but the more you order the better deals you receive. Using the deals section can help with this too. If you‚Äôre saving $5-$10 dollars it off sets the cost of the delivery üòâ, delivery without added cost.",4
ubereats,1058959277,2022-10-29 09:23:22,Scams and rude customer service,"The app is trash , customer service is trash, pricing is misleading . I ordered groceries because my car is in the shop . I linked my store reward card items that were showing reduced price and buy one get one free I was charged In full for everything., I pre tipped a percentage of the order I was unable to change the amount based on the items I actually received  and did not approve the tip but was charged. Went to chat support and I don‚Äôt know it it‚Äôs an automated system or if the person simply couldn‚Äôt read. I provided specific examples and chat was ended on me  in the middle of me typing . This company just ripped me off over $50 easily. Way to take advantage of someone when they are down. I will never use uber or uber eats after this.",1
ubereats,1058959277,2022-10-01 23:41:16,Waste of Time,"My experience with this app in the Chesapeake, VA area is that many restaurants simply don‚Äôt partner with Uber Eats. The restaurants that do end up charging a hefty delivery fee or cancel orders. This has led to, at times, everyone picking a restaurant, each person going through the menu, placing the order, having it cancelled (or getting a pop up halfway through the order that the restaurant is ‚Äòno longer available‚Äô); just to have to go through the whole process again. Generally, you don‚Äôt pick a delivery option for dinner until your already close to dinner time. It‚Äôs not just a waste of time, it‚Äôs exceptionally frustrating and puts a hungry family in the position of scrambling to then come up with a dinner option that will actually be available.",1
ubereats,1058959277,2022-10-27 02:03:27,Love the deals but get option anxiety,I can trust a restaurant way more if I can tell their photos are authentic. ALMOST EVERY TIME I‚Äôll check yelp reviews and photos before buying Uber eats. Have you ever thought of partnering with yelp? Seeing REAL authentic food pics makes me want to get the food way more- if it looks good. Also I almost always come back for the 40% off promos cause it feels way cheaper and convenient then eating out. I got a full Thai meal for myself and my roommate for 27$ and that‚Äôs really good. But yeah if there were REAL photos from REAL people in Uber eats I‚Äôd trust it a lot more and wouldn‚Äôt switch between apps.,4
ubereats,1058959277,2022-12-17 23:41:07,DELETE THE APP,"I talked to two customer service on chat, called and got connected to a supervisor and my issue was not fixed. My order was delivered at the wrong unit. I contacted the driver, and he said he would try to get my order back to me but he never came. And stopped answering his phone. They are not able to give me a refund for an order I didn‚Äôt receive. It doesn‚Äôt make sense to pay, without receiving anything. At least someone else is eating good with a free meal, however my son isn‚Äôt able to eat I have to reorder through doordash. Please run and download doordash delete this app to save u some money. When the time comes that your delivery driver takes ur food somewhere else beside your doorstep, uber will not care and leave you dry. Save your money, order somewhere else",1
ubereats,1058959277,2022-09-28 11:48:18,Terrible!,"I decided that i wanted to order some donuts for the office. Everything look good but as soon as i hit placed order it said it was to far. I was bummed but said okay i‚Äôll just pick it up. Well i chose pick up and ordered. As soon as i placed the order it said unable to proceed and denied my card. Bummed AGAIN i just decided to go to the donut shop in person. Then i see my bank account to make sure i was not charged and guess what i WAS!  Called costumer service they said don‚Äôt worry it‚Äôs just pending but it‚Äôs not going to go through. That was friday, I checked yesterday (tuesday) and it went through. Called costumer service and they kept transferring me to different people. No one was able to help me. So now i have to call my bank and do a claim because they stole my money.",1
ubereats,1058959277,2022-09-25 01:35:39,Estimates are off by hours,"There have been 3 instances in which my food delivery has been late by over 1-2 hours / didn‚Äôt arrive. The customer service afterwards was dreadful. One order from Prince St Pizza was late by 2+ hours after pick up by the driver, who ultimately cancelled. Uber eats gave me a refund on the food and a $5 credit‚Ä¶ not sure how that‚Äôs supposed to help when I‚Äôd been waiting for food to feed 6 people and it‚Äôd been that late. 2 other orders were late by over an hour. 

Before ordering from a restaurant, I look at the arrival estimates. If I knew that they‚Äôd be much later (I‚Äôm talking hours) than expected, then I wouldn‚Äôt have ordered from there at all. They need to do better about getting estimates from other customers and actually factoring that in.",1
ubereats,1058959277,2022-09-20 03:12:13,"Great App, WORST SERVICE","Discrimination to the highest level. I had issues (several) with eats and switched to DD. And wanted to check if they have upgraded their services, but gone downhill. Just a day ago before writing this review, ordered through eats and the delivery person‚Äôs car broke down right in-front of the restaurant. Though the delivery person contacted the support they took staggering 30 mins to call me and update that my order will not be delivered. When asked on the call to connect to a supervisor they apparently don‚Äôt have a way to do so. Also, when I asked them to place another order on the call, they couldn‚Äôt do that either. I wanted to raise issues, but for that I had to drop off the call from the support team and call them back; what a JOKE!!!!!!",1
ubereats,1058959277,2022-10-30 06:27:58,No accountability,"Uber Eats this is the last dollar you take from me. I‚Äôm done. Every time it‚Äôs something wrong. So inconsistent. My orders are constantly delayed. It will give you the approx delivery time and then it gets delayed 30 mins or longer. 

Fees are out of control. Always missing items or getting them wrong and they never refund or credit you for the mistakes. Over it. This app was my preferred app even though it‚Äôs pricier than others but I‚Äôve had it.  I ordered nachos and they should of been here by now but instead it got delayed over 30 mins. I‚Äôm sure these soggy nachos will full fill my hunger. Should of just gone to pick them up. I have a twisted ankle so this is why I‚Äôm relying on this app so heavily lately‚Ä¶ but dealing with Uber Eats is much more painful.",1
ubereats,1058959277,2022-10-25 23:01:55,Great app,"I think that it‚Äôs a great app, but one thing that I think they could add that would make my experience a lot better in this app, is if they have a way to tell the restaurant that your ordering from like a custom note or a message, because sometimes there isn‚Äôt a certain customization option.

For example, if I want less ice in my drink because a restaurant puts way too much ice and that‚Äôs not an option in the customization menu, then I should be able to write a note that says less ice. They could already have that feature but idk where it is.",4
ubereats,1058959277,2022-09-27 19:09:47,App works fine but notifications are insane,"Never really had an issue with the Uber/Uber eats app itself but my main issue is the number of push notifications they send through. I‚Äôve never once seen an ad for some promo and found it important or worthwhile, but I have considered fully deleting the app after getting 5-10 push notifications like that in a day. 

You have to HUNT to find the settings to turn them off and they always somehow mysteriously turn back on after a month or two. Please consider being more thoughtful in your push notifications to customers and stop bombarding with nonsense.",3
ubereats,1058959277,2022-11-07 23:09:48,Charged $85 dollars for cancellation,"Uber eats charged me $85 for cancelation. I placed an order and cancelled it 20 seconds later because I wanted to change my method  of payment. I cancelled it and placed the order again  with the method of payment I wanted to use. They delivered the order and everything seemed to be okay, but one day later I cheked my bank account and realized they charged me $85 for cancellation. I call them and they said I should have read all uber eats  policies(you know the small tricky letters) so be carful while using this service.",5
ubereats,1058959277,2022-12-17 18:07:35,Limited refunds,"I like the app but when it comes to missing items beware of the times it happens. They can only reimburse you a few times. After that, you will be paying full price without any type of credit or reimbursement for missing items. Which I think is completely unfair because that‚Äôs your money. Unfortunately, I have had the bad luck of always missing an item in my order and there‚Äôs nothing I can do about it. I think the person in charge of picking up your order should verify everything is there to avoid missing items. Especially when the item is obvious. For example the drink. Additionally, some drivers have poor communication skills and they make unexpected stops without warning.",1
ubereats,1058959277,2022-11-21 16:03:41,Terrible customer service,"I‚Äôve been a very loyal Uber Eats customer for the past few years.  A couple nights ago, I ordered food, and one of the items had a very long hair in it.  Absolutely disgusting.  I wound up throwing away the whole order because of how unsanitary that is.  I contacted Uber Eats customer service, and they refunded me for the one item that had the hair in it, $7 of a $40 order.  I have messaged them 5 times requesting the full refund since I had to throw the food out, and they tell me it‚Äôs their policy to work with the restaurants to resolve food safety issues and won‚Äôt refund the rest of the order. 

I am done with Uber Eats after such terrible service.  I paid for food that was thrown away.  A full refund should have happened immediately.",1
ubereats,1058959277,2022-10-19 14:51:01,No customer service,"I typically use Dash Pass but wanted to try Uber One out. This isn‚Äôt about the restaurants, because I‚Äôve learned they are all trashy at making food and getting orders correct. But when there is a problem, Uber can‚Äôt help, there‚Äôs no person to talk to. Dash pass takes 10 seconds to fix or refund me. Uber takes 10 years to find the help button and still doesn‚Äôt fix anything. You are left waiting for an email that never arrives! Going back to dash pass, they also don‚Äôt allow you to change the tip, which I fear for the Uber drivers getting ripped off when it‚Äôs not there fault the order is wrong!! I still give good tips because gas is expensive!!",2
ubereats,1058959277,2022-12-04 01:37:35,Flat soda because of marketing scheme,I‚Äôve been using Uber eats for a few years now but lately my orders have been arriving late. Today I ordered food that was more than 20 minutes late. My food was cold and my soda was flat. In the past Uber eats has offered a discount on my next order. But lately I have been receiving emails instead to sign up for Uber one or something. Trying to get me to have a free trial as an ‚Äúapology‚Äù. It‚Äôs just a marketing scheme. I think they are directing the drivers to purposefully delay the food to either get people to pay the ‚Äúpriority‚Äù fee or get people to sign up for this Uber one thing. It‚Äôs disingenuous and shady and I deleted the app because of it. I won‚Äôt be using it any more and will happily give my business to other food delivery apps.,1
ubereats,1058959277,2022-09-22 01:21:36,Disappointed,"I wish I wasn‚Äôt writing this negative review, but it‚Äôs gotten to the point where I need to say something. I used this app all the time when I was very sick about a year ago, and basically relied on it to get food. Everything worked great‚Ä¶ that is until I stopped paying for Uber One (for financial reasons). So far since the DAY of cancellation, every single order WITHOUT FAIL has been wrong, or something has been wrong with the app. I‚Äôm not talking about just a few orders too, I‚Äôm talking about dozens over the past 6 months, with little to no help with returns. The same thing has also been happening to my boyfriend, so I know it‚Äôs not just me. This used to be my go-to app for ordering food, but now I‚Äôm heavily considering switching to Doordash.",1
ubereats,1058959277,2022-11-04 22:10:46,Competing w DoorDash and doing it wrong?,"They‚Äôre competing with DoorDash‚Äôs ‚Äúability to add to your order with a $0 delivery fee‚Äù but the weird thing is that DD has your deliverer pickup both orders. Uber Eats hires a totally other person, so you‚Äôre left waiting for the second part to your order and probably not paying the other guy as much since you tip differently when its combined vs two individual orders assuming its the same person. Like on DD I would add to my already placed tip, as a bonus. With UE, you have to tip completely separate people. Its just a weird method and I wish they clarified that so the first few times I used that extended service, I tipped correctly and don‚Äôt waiting confused for the second half.",2
ubereats,1058959277,2022-12-13 17:06:45,Never sent my order to the restaurant - was for a business meeting,"I showed up at the same time Uber eats alerted me that the order was sent to the restaurant bc I was paranoid it would be done on time. When I got there, they had not received it. Luckily they agreed to get stated on the list I had from the app. 15 mins later they still did not have the order and didn‚Äôt get it until o reached out to help to have it pushed through. Terrible customer service from Uber eats. You are literally telling me it was sent when it wasn‚Äôt. The first thing offer d to me from help desk was to just cancel the order but I needed this food for a business meeting with our ceos. Horrible all around Uber experience. Thankfully the restaurant was able to come through.",1
ubereats,1058959277,2022-10-24 14:51:55,Garbage - gotta pay twice to get what you ordered,"If your order is wrong. You have to pay an additional delivery fee and tip to get it corrected. Customer service is a joke. It took them 3 hours of going back and forth discussing this issue. Then they told me to contact them when I ordered within an hour of the original order. It was already three hours later that you told me this! Well after an hour after the order. When I reordered and contacted Uber, they said they can‚Äôt help because it was past an hour after the order. Really? There is no point to using this service. When you have an issue you get no real help to set everything right. I should not have to pay more money to get my order corrected.",1
ubereats,1058959277,2022-10-01 18:02:23,When it comes to customer service,"So I had an issue where I didn‚Äôt receive some food items. I one of the food items that I did receive had a hair in it. The customer service  made it seem like the main issue was the hair in the food. Which was an issue but we wanted a refund for what we didn‚Äôt receive. Which was literally half the order. The customer service was very automated, scripted and not helpful at all. Which convenient as according to the terms, nothing could be done as they disregarded we were still missing half our order and only made it about a hair. By the way they wanted a photo by the time they got back to us was four days. This seems like a greedy corporation with bad customers service.",1

This is the business that you created, now these things should‚Äôve  been dealt with in the planning stages. Okay, say place an order at 7. That food will  take 3 hourssss to get there. That‚Äôs IF you get lucky and get a driver who doesn‚Äôt cancel the pickup halfway through(bcuz they are waiting to get the freaking food from the restaurant). Which btw is Forcing you to wait even longer to be accepted by ANKTHER DRIVER!

ubereats,1058959277,2022-12-17 23:15:26,Some Coupons and discounts are pointless ..,"The coupons aren‚Äôt really worth it. I get it, everyone has to make money somehow, but don‚Äôt give coupons if they aren‚Äôt going to actually do anything. Like not all of the coupons are bad, but you guys do things like say ‚Äú$15 off of you spend $40 or more‚Äù then , after putting $42 worth of stuff in my cart , you take off $15 just to put it back in taxes fee and delivery charges, bringing it back to $41. Pointless. Or you‚Äôll do ‚Äúup to 25% off $30+ orders‚Äù and then take off $8, then put it back in taxes fees and deliver charges! At that point, why even give the discount?",3
ubereats,1058959277,2022-11-13 09:36:15,The truth about Uber Eats,"I barely write reviews, and when I do, I love to write a nice opinion, but unfortunately, this is a very horrible review. I wasn‚Äôt driving for a while, so I was dependent on an app like Uber Eats. The problem is that they ripped me off in many ways. I am a big guy, so I can eat. I was being charged almost $50 to $60 for 2 to 3 items. When I was eating a lot, I could probably walk into a store and get about 8 items for the same price. This is because they not only hit you with so many fees and charges, but they also raise the cost of the item. Now the time it takes to get to my home is being delayed. My best advice is that if you have the transportation to get to the restaurants, go there instead of wasting valuable money.",1
ubereats,1058959277,2022-09-17 13:06:37,So upset & hungry,"I placed an order for breakfast while at work, I even paid for it to be Priority. I get a message saying my order is being delivered on a bicycle. & then a message to rate me order ? i never revived my order, & never received a message if it was left somewhere. The phone number keep going to voicemail.  I am upset that I waited so long & never even received my food. Now I have to go & do the process over & I have a health condidtion that needs food at certain times. Totally disappointed with Uber Eats Drivers. & it‚Äôs not about the refund, i needed food, not my money back.",4
ubereats,1058959277,2022-10-18 18:59:38,I deleted the app,"They charged me for an order I canceled. I asked for customer service because I canceled said order not even a minute after I ordered it (took three days of repeat questioning to even get an agent and when they answered they said the restaurant was already preparing the order and closed the chat). They said the restaurant (Dunkin) was already preparing my order. However when my friend tried to order from them they said they were too busy to take delivery orders. On the same app within the same minute. I heavily doubt they had started on my order. Not to mention I just ordered donuts, Dunkin doesn‚Äôt make donuts to order so it‚Äôs not like it was special items.",2
ubereats,1058959277,2022-09-12 15:16:04,Much worse than other apps like DoorDash,"Restaurants routinely join and leave this app. It says restaurants can‚Äôt deliver to my address that Door Dash and other always deliver to. The standard delivery time says 30-45min but is consistently ~1.5 hours or more long (therefore always late, and I can‚Äôt use this app if I have a client meeting right after lunch because it won‚Äôt come on time or will be cold). If the order is wrong Uber Eats‚Äô customer service has the nerve to yell at YOU for requesting a refund. 

So to sum it up: horrible customer service, routinely late, crappy app. I only use Uber Eats because my company gives me a monthly allowance on it for remote work. The rest of the month I happily use Door Dash.",2
ubereats,1058959277,2022-12-21 06:12:53,Where‚Äôs my refund?,"Placed an order through this app.  Items were missing when the order was received.  Contacted the driver through the app, his response was that we could get a refund.  Called the restaurant, their response was that they would send another driver with the missing items.  The items never arrived.  Then contacted support via this app in chat, response was that the ticket will be closed because they are experiencing some type of difficulty.  If the ticket is not resolved it should not be closed.  This isn‚Äôt over until a refund is received.  When you go online you will see many people who have experienced this same issue.   This is not how you conduct business or treat your customers.",1
ubereats,1058959277,2022-12-03 23:17:57,Steals customers money,"They lie on their website saying if you receive incorrect items and missing items, you‚Äôll receive a refund. I ordered pizzas that were never delivered, the driver and restaurant can confirm. I have a picture of brownies in a pizza box to further prove it. They put brownies in pizza boxes instead. I never submitted a refund request before. They keep saying my order is not eligible for refund but won‚Äôt explain why. When I asked why it isn‚Äôt eligible, they stopped responding to me through the app and twitter. DO NOT RISK LOSING YOUR MONEY. The worst customer service I have ever experienced and I will never use any Uber services again. A billion dollar company stealing money from their customers is a shame. Do not use Uber even if it‚Äôs a last resort.",1
ubereats,1058959277,2022-10-04 18:33:37,Convenient but not much else,"I use Uber Eats primarily when working conferences or other all-day events when going to pick up food myself is not an option.

The good news is that it‚Äôs convenient and offers lots of options. 

There are several things that make me want to delete the app, however. 

The biggest issue is freshness; drivers almost always pick food up late so it‚Äôs been sitting at the restaurant for 20 minutes before it even gets out the door. I tip well, so I can‚Äôt understand why this happens consistently.

It also drives me crazy that you can‚Äôt search or sort by distance. I don‚Äôt want food from a restaurant that‚Äôs 9 miles away. It will be gross by the time it arrives. I have to use Google Maps to see nearby restaurants, then see if they‚Äôre on Uber Eats.

Drivers forget to bring beverages probably 75% of the time. And they bring napkins and utensils about 10% of the time. 

Really, the only reason I don‚Äôt delete the app is that Grubhub is somehow worse.",3
ubereats,1058959277,2022-10-27 23:33:09,Good service,"Compared to door dash it‚Äôs like getting a five star restaurant to a a 2 even if you order to the same restaurant.  Other companies forget your sauces, half your order and provide a credit without even talking to you, I don‚Äôt want sweet and sour chicken without the swerve n sour and a credit for $2.00 off the $10 sweet n sour chicken doesn‚Äôt make it right.
Then you can go to the chat room, wait 30 minutes to get literally cussed out by the overworked twenty something unprofessionally handling the situation.",5

It took over 2 hours for the first ordered, and for the one today, the restaurant hadn‚Äôt even finished preparing the other when the ‚Äúpriority‚Äù time expired. So, we either need to work with our restaurants to make sure they are following your estimates, you update your estimates so we know if you are actually going to make it her on time make it more of a ‚Äúdeadline‚Äù, or you just quit taking everyone‚Äôs money for priority delivery because it especially seems like a scam.",2

Now for regular orders that are just late but still fulfilled you expect me to enjoy? i had to wait forever for cold/soggy food? why is the restaurant preparing this food immediately after accepting the order, they shouldn‚Äôt be making the food until a driver has confirmed they will deliver it‚Ä¶ that food sits out for over an hour before it gets to me‚Ä¶ that‚Äôs barely safe/healthy depending on what it is‚Ä¶ rework this entire app, get a new strategy.",1

Largest issue is that the app will not default to your nearest location, even when ordering from the same franchise. Multiple times I've had to cancel, or wait longer than I should because it auto picks a location 8 miles away, when the same eateries are located less than a mile away. Lastly, menu options do not reflect what is actually available from a location, and alterations are not sometimes possible on the app, when it would not be an issue in person.",3

So because other restaurants make a mistake, I have to be penalized for it? pretty much, they stole my money! gave me something that I didn‚Äôt ask for and said sorry lol I‚Äôm deactivating my account, and there is no promotion that they can give me to make me come back.",1
ubereats,1058959277,2022-11-19 03:02:15,Major Flaw,"What REALLY bothers me about this app is if the order doesn‚Äôt go through because either a declined payment or the restaurant is out of an item, instead of sending a NOTIFICATION to you, it just doesn‚Äôt submit the order and waits for you to open the app again. 

This has happened to me twice in the past two weeks where I open the app 30-40 minutes later to check the order status, and it turns out that my order never even went through but now I can‚Äôt fix the problem because the restaurant closed. Incredibly annoying. 

PLEASE fix this.",3

My other favorite ‚Äúfeature‚Äù is when the search shows you dozens of restaurants but when you tap them, it warns you ‚Äúthis place will close in 3 minutes.‚Äù  If the business hours are available, why not show them in the search results, or filter places that are closing soon?

All in all, Uber is ran by venture capitalists and overpaid programmers in Silicon Valley, and they underpay their contractors, who actually get the job done.   I want to stop using it but the alternatives aren‚Äôt much better.",1
ubereats,1058959277,2022-11-16 14:58:59,Why so much increase in money?,"I appreciate the convenience and am willing to pay and tip well but explain to me why they food or drinks have an increase in price when ordered through the app (Uber eats or door dash) plus the deliver fee of 2 or more dollars plus the tip. 

So Uber Eats, how much money are you making? Does the restaurant I am ordering from see the profits of the dollar or more increase on the product or is that your profit?

This has caused me to change my mind and not use these platform. I‚Äôm going to put my money in the restaurants so they are still here for us to enjoy instead of bankrupt from this corruption.",3
ubereats,1058959277,2022-12-03 15:29:27,Great except for communication and delivery times,"I love using the app and ability to order from many restaurants but when there is a problem with an order it‚Äôs difficult that you can‚Äôt speak to someone. Sometimes it‚Äôs resolved properly and others it‚Äôs not. Also when you pay for priority delivery or even just regular delivery and the time increases 15+ minutes from the latest time originally stated it‚Äôs not fair to have to pay for priority still and not being able to do anything about it being so much later than originally stated, which happens often",3
ubereats,1058959277,2022-11-09 23:01:50,"The app is pretty cool, but‚Ä¶","The app is pretty cool, I‚Äôve always had good experiences with delivery , but: 1. Prices are often higher now for each item (thus used to distinguish Uber esta from DoorDash in usa). 2. Moreover there are additional charges for Uber, such that even paying for the premium you are not breaking even before tip. 3. If you go to a new place, it doesn‚Äôt realize that you are traveling. This can lead to some confusion while you look for restaurants that you know should be there (maybe even cause you to order from the wrong restaurant I imagine)",4
ubereats,1058959277,2022-09-26 13:18:31,Don‚Äôt deserve NO stars!,"I been using Uber just because I have little kids with no help. Never fails to give me the worst experience. Order always takes longer and the food gets here cold, bad shape, missing items because drivers don‚Äôt take a second to make sure everything is ok. Adding to that, drivers take multiple pick ups! Customer service is the worse ever! Refunds un most cases I don‚Äôt get back. You pay a lot of money for a service that don‚Äôt have nothing to do with you after something‚Äôs goes wrong. Drivers are crap amd don‚Äôt care how much you spent they just want to make as much deliveries possible to make money and they expect a tip on top of that. Delivering cold, damage, and missing items for you.",1

I was not informed that cancelling the order would have made it so that I couldn‚Äôt even order food at all because it stops at 10:30 in my area. THIS NIGHT my Five Guys order took 90 MINUTES to get cancelled BY THE DRIVER! The driver had asked me an hour prior to the cancellation for my address because the app was bugging out (which it was), so I gave it to him. No status updates for 40 minutes so I message him and 10 minutes later he cancels my order after reading my messages. After TWO experiences like this I am highly unlikely to order from Uber Eats again.",1

Doesn‚Äôt give a warning that it may close within 3 minutes of starting your order. App is not stable and crashes. Found new restaurant, spent about 5-7 minutes placing order, went to check out and app was non responsive to the ‚Äúcheckout‚Äù button. You could add more things to your order or view info about the restaurant, but still couldn‚Äôt complete the purchase. Restarted app and placed order all over, worked this time. Really sad considering the markup, and today‚Äôs technological advances.",2

My hope is that they don‚Äôt sabotage themselves with those extra-entree-sized fees, because they usually mean the difference between me ordering via an app, or going to get my own take-out.  I will never pay the same price for a delivery experience as I do for an eat-in restaurant experience, so be careful what fees you slip in there.",4
ubereats,1058959277,2022-09-24 03:19:52,Would have could have,"Mod pizza had an option to add sauce on top of their pizza at the end just like in person if you were to order. But, they got rid of or don‚Äôt have that option to add their previous sauces that they normally provide as options at the end in person via the app here. 

It‚Äôs late and I just wanted to have the same experience with options but I‚Äôm guessing due to complying with the chain‚Äôs rules and updated regulations, I don‚Äôt have those options anymore. 

I think the chains should really come together and figure out geolocations where if you are in a certain town that will allow additional last sauce toppings, it should be more intuitive and allowed instead of a general overall consensus of the franchise decision to make every single pizza place comply with locational standards. 

Not fair to people that know the menu and then get cut on location regulations and restrictions.",4
ubereats,1058959277,2022-11-22 19:41:21,Customer Service is not great,When there is a problem with the order and you have to talk to an agent it‚Äôs such a pain and so time consuming. Sure they‚Äôll give you a refund if the order is wrong or damaged but when it‚Äôs time to give you a credit you must ask for it AND the credit will be so small. It‚Äôs amazing how it SEEMS like they WANT you to tip the drivers but when it‚Äôs time for them to give a credit it doesn‚Äôt cover anything more than the tip you give a driver. If you‚Äôre tipping the driver then the credit is what covers their tip and you get nothing more for the inconvenience.,3
ubereats,1058959277,2022-09-11 11:26:58,Customer Service,"My family ordered a pizza using Uber Eats service.  Our pizza took a good amount of time & came ICE COLD & tasted rubbery.  We contacted Uber Eats immediately & was told sorry there is nothing they can do.  So you pay extra to order through their service for convenience but they accept zero responsibility & told me to contact the establishment.  The establishment loses money because some of their price goes toward Uber Eats.  So basically the customer pays extra to use their service for convenience & the establishment pays toward Uber Eats losing profit but Uber Eats accepts zero responsibility that they are serving anything with quality.  It‚Äôs absolutely horrible business service.  Use Grub Hub, Instacart or just order through the establishment.   Uber Eats is trash.",1
ubereats,1058959277,2022-11-20 01:06:32,"Love the app, hate the service fees","Love this app, hate the service fees. It‚Äôs next to impossible to get a hold of anyone to resolve any issues that arise and not easy to get refunds. This app is a necessity, however for all those late, cold and rainy nights and the days and nights where there is nothing for miles. My two biggest pet peeves are that they allow people on bicycles to deliver, so if the driver does not insulate your food properly it will be cold, and the fact that it asks you to tip as you are completing your order. It‚Äôs like, let‚Äôs see how the service is, right?",4

It is the most absolute terrible display of customer service I have EVER experienced!! not only that I can count on three sets of hands maybe more the amount of times that I received my orders with missing items, cold food, food that‚Äôs been tampered with, and the list goes on. And they do not care. do yourself a favor save your money and order food elsewhere I promise you if you don‚Äôt, you will regret it.",1

If you leave on notifications , you get bombarded with ads for junk food you never in a million years would order ; all day long . App is a total failure and makes it unusable as far as I am concerned for this reason . No one wants coupons all day . Further , their drivers often make more than one stop , taking FAR FAR longer than if you order from the restaurant direct. I got food poisoning the last time and have had dangerous delivery drivers lie about their location . Uber refunded me ; but nonetheless , ordering direct from the restaurant eliminates all of this an is always at least 25% cheaper .",1
ubereats,1058959277,2022-11-05 22:01:15,Frustrated,Had a driver steal my food for the first time last night. First the order was delayed which I was not too concerned about since they gave me a $5 credit for the inconvenience. The driver claimed my order was at the door but no order. I contacted customer service & they told me my order was not ‚Äúeligible‚Äù for a refund because it showed that the driver reached the drop off location. This is terrible customer service! I‚Äôve never had this issue or had a complaint until now & yet I could not get my money back? The rep offered a $10 credit & never even provided that. Ubereats really needs to do better when it comes to its customers! I never received my food but was treated as if it was my fault.,1
ubereats,1058959277,2022-10-28 12:05:02,The promos not like they use to,Used Uber eats often; I drive so I order Uber eats on lazy days  and it would be either a hit or miss sometimes when it comes to ordering delivery for a good deal. The promotions they use to have were the best because the promo could be used at any restaurant or at least the restaurants in my area that i would normally eat. Now the promotions are for places that either doesn‚Äôt have a good variety of choices or the prices are 5x as more as what i would would spend normally so The promo isn‚Äôt really a promo. Please stop being greedy and let me choose my places to eat,3
ubereats,1058959277,2022-10-21 23:07:23,You can take bets that the order will not arrive as described,"I almost never write comments or reviews. This one has been overdue for sometime now. I have lost track of how many times did I NOT receive the correct order, sometimes items ordered were missing, and other times the order itself was missing. I know it‚Äôs not Uber who prepares the food, however, they sure deliver it and that‚Äôs the company I pay. It would be extremely nice for a driver to verify the food items (may be not open the boxes) before they pick it up. I am very dissatisfied with Uber yet I order from them cause I have found very many options on other apps. I would love to be an Uber member if they can improve this for me.",1
ubereats,1058959277,2022-10-05 14:27:47,Terrible! Do not use Uber Eats/Postmates,I have ordered using uber eats multiple times and time after time my orders arrive wrong. They do not hold the restaurants or drivers accountable at all. There are no places for notes and they decide to not refund your money if you‚Äôve had refunds in the past. It is not our fault that they don‚Äôt have any quality control measures within the system they are creating. I basically paid $50 for two child subs (literally) and two drinks I did not order. After reviewing they pretty much said ‚Äúsorry for this but no refund.‚Äù Basically by using this app you are prepaying for a good/service you may or may not receive. It‚Äôs not worth it for all the delivery fees and up charges.,1
ubereats,1058959277,2022-09-27 19:46:48,Something is wrong,I am not sure how to get in touch with anyone in this company but you are over charging for taxes on food. I want to see the additional charges on the receipt and where they are going. This seems very suspicious. Then you calculate the tip by the highest amount before any discounts. I would like proof the drivers actually receives the full amount. Seems odd to calculate tip by the price of food and not the distance they drive. They have no association with the restaurant you are ordering from. It should require a higher tip the further away the restaurant is from the delivery address.,3
ubereats,1058959277,2022-11-15 13:01:28,Incorrect Items/Billing,"Billed me for incorrect items. I brought it up when the issue was discovered (2 days later as item was a bouquet of flowers and I ordered them for my wife while out of town). Uber Eats refused to address this; said I should rate the merchant. I took it up with the credit card company, who refunded me. Uber Eats billed my other credit card on file without authorization. Took up the issue with the second credit card company, who again refunded me. Six months later Uber Eats billed me the incorrect amount again for the previous order. Uber Eats continues to say there is nothing they can do and that I should be on the hook for paying more than 2x the purchase price of the product I received.",1
ubereats,1058959277,2022-11-06 05:07:38,Do not recommend- VERY UNHELPFUL CUSTOMER SUPPORT,"I was considering switching from doordash to ubereats until I made an order and received no driver info or tracking capabilities. Ubereats said order was delivered yet I didn‚Äôt have photo confirmation and it never actually did show up. I contacted support and they told me I entered in an address I never heard of and refused refund even though my confirmation email had the correct address. I had to call and they told me they‚Äôd make a ‚Äòone time exception‚Äô to refund me since they said I didn‚Äôt provide the correct address despite never using a different address and having confirmation of the address sent to me and shown on the app. Way sketchy compared to my experience with doordash, NO THANKS!",1

She cancelled our order. It‚Äôs pretty clear that she dined and dashed. I‚Äôm sure she will be punished, but that doesn‚Äôt help me. The issue is that at 9 pm, we have no food that will be delivered before 10 and uber eats policy apparently doesn‚Äôt allow customer support to do more than refund the order. For our wasted time, in which the app assured us it would just take 5 minutes longer for a good hour, we got nothing besides 10 dollars in Uber eats credits. It‚Äôs not worth it to spend that on this app where I end up hungry and angry and eating at 10 pm. Don‚Äôt waste your time.",1

ubereats,1058959277,2022-09-23 11:27:06,Annoying Notifications,"Would be five stars except for one very annoying problem. The app will send random notifications that are nothing more than advertisements for uber eats. I want the notifications when I actually order something so that the driver can contact me if needed. But, if I forget to turn off the notifications, I will inevitably be woken up by a stupid advertisement a day or two later. Seriously uber eats, if I trust you to be able to give me notifications for the purpose of using the app as intended, please do not violate that trust by sending unwanted notifications that are nothing more than an advertisement, especially in the middle of the night or early in the morning.",1

I tried canceling on my end this time because I didn‚Äôt want to waste my time and the app prompted me to cancel and didn‚Äôt refund me at all- I finally got a hold of a live person and they told me it was ‚Äúin the terms‚Äù that no refunds are given- so now I‚Äôm without food and money?!

After a long back and forth with robots answering, they said my purchase was not eligible for refund and that my account had too many refund requests..
This was my first time asking for a refund. I was shocked to hear that their first answer was the quality of my account which was they based on wrong information. They would not bring this up to  a supervisor ( of course, this only a robot answering always the same crafted response ).
This is just too risky to order on this site and prefer grub hub for their management of the same issue",1

In a pinch I am able to order food on-the-spot, and as a partner I am able to work on my own schedule, and thus far I feel like Uber treats me fairly as a partner, which is so important to me as I run and manage my own business.  Thanks Uber and to those who support all of us!",5
ubereats,1058959277,2022-12-02 17:36:57,Uber delivery taking too long,Uber eats takes way too long to deliver. It does not matter if the place you are ordering from is near or far from you. I have had multiple issues with the delivery time in the latest arrival. Sometimes the latest arrival is an hour after I place the order that is unacceptable. It is unacceptable that if I place an order at 11 AM that the latest arrival is 12:25 PM. By that time my order is cold and I am upset because I have had to wait over an hour for an order that should‚Äôve taken about 30 minutes to deliver to me or less.,3
ubereats,1058959277,2022-11-30 19:28:34,Worst experience of my life,I ordered a large Starbucks order so that I could get the $25 discount thing on my first order and the driver. Micheal sent it to the wrong address and I called him telling him so. He told me to wait till after he was done with the order he was working on and I did because I am a pleasant person and the order never showed up and I can‚Äôt find a way to contact him again. so I issued a refund to my Uber Eats account so I could re-order my order and no I don‚Äôt get the first order discount so I can‚Äôt use the money and have to spend more money if I want the same order and I‚Äôm still waiting on the first order because he said he would bring it but he never dead.

I could‚Äôve easily gone out and got it myself, which is exactly what I‚Äôll be doing from now on instead of using this money-grabbing scam of an app ever again. Believe me, you don‚Äôt wanna waste your time and money with this app. You‚Äôre much better off ordering delivery through the restaurant itself.",1
ubereats,1058959277,2022-10-07 01:49:48,Uber Eats,"This was the last time I use UBER EATS. The app platform has apparently been modified to discourage any of their users to complain about an order. On several occasions, they have automatically entered a tip when none was given due to poor service, eg dropped out front before anyone could get there and the food was taken (live in an urban setting). On attempting to view the receipt, you are informed to look at in 24 hours, apparently assuming correctly that most people won‚Äôt come back to it. Lastly, they will not allow you to use the microphone on your phone so you have to type everything out.
 Maybe Door Dash or another app provider is better- I guess I‚Äôll find out. Done with UBER",1

There are people like me that rely on this service.

You order, says being prepared, arriving by, latest arrival etc. 1/2 hr to over an hour later you get a cancellation order alert leaving family with no dinner. Plus you lose the promotion for that order. Reaching Customer Service is often additional long waiting time or not reached at all. Trying them out this free month for their Uber Eats plus type program. So far a failure.

ubereats,1058959277,2022-09-21 12:33:35,Scammers,I ordered food from Uber eats and at the exact same time Uber rides charged my card as well. They acted like it was something they never seen before even though they are linked apps and obviously give your card and information to other partnered companies to charge your card so do not install this app because your card info goes to other apps to charge your card who knows what other charges id get if I didn‚Äôt notice. Never got a refund only ran around then sent an email then ignored after my first reply. They are obviously scammers. Promotions aren‚Äôt worth it if they charge your card for a ride to make up for it then play the scammer deck with a skip card in it.,1

Well after not even having any price adjustments in months they refuse to refund anything off my order even when it‚Äôs their own fault. Their systems are faulty and will not refund you if you‚Äôve had more than a certain amount so you cant rely on them as a delivery service, this is outrageous considering how the whole point of having uber one is to be certain your food is here correctly and on time. charging me for food that never even got delivered feels more like a scam than a proper service.",1

Worst of all, the proposed tip (starting at 20%) is on top of the delivery fee, Service fee, and tax!!  Highway robbery!  Lastly, I have received 3 emails for promotions in the last month- all of which when I tried to redeem I was told I‚Äôm ineligible!  Then why are you targeting me?!?

My nuggets had pieces of someone‚Äôs hair cooked into the batter, as well as I had received the wrong size milkshakes. I contacted customer service as my wife was unable to eat her food due to the foreign hair that she found in the nuggets. It took customer service over 8 hours to respond to me and then refused to help my issue due to I had already thrown the food away at this point, and they wanted a picture of the hair. Customer service also refused to fix the issue with the milkshake sizes as well. So I basically got inedible food and got skimped on large milkshakes. Uber eats learn how to treat your customers.",1
ubereats,1058959277,2022-11-14 01:39:47,Terrible customer service wait,I‚Äôve never used this until today. My friend is always raving about this delivery app so I wanted to give it a try and I also had a 25 dollar off coupon and free delivery so I thought why not! Wrong. I put in the right address but took the driver to a completely different place..was on the phone with the driver trying to look for him but he couldn‚Äôt do anything about the order. He had to cancel and I wanted to get a refund but customer service wait was long and the wait time kept getting bigger and higher.,3
ubereats,1058959277,2022-11-01 20:07:30,Basically a scam,"So I understand that the convenience of ordering online and delivery can sometimes be more expensive. I had found a deal for a restaurant that allowed free delivery if I spent X amount delivery at that location would be free.

Well low and behold when I go to check out there is a 20+ fee attached to my order‚Ä¶ my bill doubled because there was a lack of drivers. I get that when there is a shortage of drivers you have to find some way to pull them in but tagging a 20$ fee onto a 20$ order is absolutely absurd. I will not be using Uber Eats again because any company that‚Äôs thinks it is appropriate to do that to their customers is not worth giving my money to.",1

I was not contacted either by the app, nor by phone, nor the delivery guy dared to ring the doorbell. He left with my order and I was charged 64 euros. I contacted the customer service which refused to refund me because they say the driver contacted me and waited 8 mn. Which is false, I dis not receive any phone call and he did not ring the doorbell, this a house! He just left with order and Uber eats think it is right to charge me not even leaving the food at the door. This is an absolute scam. The wrong practices of this company are frightening, I will never order again on this app. The restaurant I contacted told me it happens all the time!",1

Example #1: A restaurant refused to fill my order due to being busy. They told the Uber driver, but Uber did not notify me. I wanted almost 2 hours because my order showed as delayed, but still in progress.

I have blood sugar issues so this is a big deal. We called to offer feedback on how important it is to update people. The response I had was crude and 100% not helpful..

Example #2:  I have had many instances of a driver picking up my food, then canceling the order to steal my food. Uber is allowing this by not disciplining the drivers. I know this because I‚Äôve driven before. I really wish they would heed this feedback..

My fianc√© and I work a lot, so we use Uber all the time. I now order from DoorDash when my sugar is low so it arrives on time.. It‚Äôs sad to see a company like this go to waste..hopefully THIS review will get somebody‚Äôs attention.",1

The second driver drove around my hotel for 10 minutes then left it inside the lobby at a different door on the side, not the main door! My order was ICE COLD! I paid $36 for a cold burger and fries and they have the nerve to give me back only $12. I don‚Äôt appreciate not being able to contact someone representing a company when I have an issue.

Probably because I‚Äôm paying with gift card credits rather than me credit card. Does this matter to DoorDash? Nope. When an issue happens, Uber HATES you talking to humans because it costs them money. So what do they do? They make it literally impossible to talk to someone unless there‚Äôs an emergency or a safety issue. I was mistakenly charged the delivery fee AND not given my 5% credit. I had to use an old order to get the chat window to appear. On top of that, they definitely have higher prices and charge more fees than DoorDash.

I know you can change it later but that doesn‚Äôt always go well. It took me a couple hours to find out that the driver took my food and by then it was too late to change the tip! I encourage anyone who has an issues with their order to start returning ALL the food and get a FULL refund tip included and see if that makes Uber Eats adjust how they do business. Ridiculous!!!!",1

BUT after digging a little further into safety concerns, just saw how an Uber driver broke into a passengers house after he dropped her off and Uber didn‚Äôt fire him until AFTER it went viral on TikTok. That‚Äôs disgusting! I use to love Uber but it has seriously gone down hill since the pandemic. I will be using other delivery services and using Lyft.",1

I spoke with representative Kurt at 7:24am, who states I should have edited my tip up to an hour after my refund‚Ä¶when I desperately tried to already, multiple times, and the godforsaken app wouldn‚Äôt let me.

The restaurants have been very kind and said it is up to Uber. With that being said buying something and not receiving it is stealing.

They told me I can‚Äôt refund an order I already placed. I told them I wanted to apply a coupon to an order I did not place yet. 

They told me, again, I can‚Äôt refund an order I already placed. I told them, again, I did not place any orders.

This repeated 3 times. I told them I felt like I wasn‚Äôt being heard and that they were doing their job poorly. I had my chat closed on me and all further conversations ignored.

I gave up on the coupon and took the $25 service fee hit and ordered anyways. Then the same support member, Anamika, manually cancelled my order and I got a notification about it. So I called customer support and relayed this story and they confirmed everything with my account history.

So they gave me $10 in credits and refunded my cancelled order, then I made the order again.

I can deduce the last is limited drivers in area based on pricing but how‚Äôs about adding to the Help section what the logos in the app mean?  That would be super useful!  I‚Äôll be honest seeing confusing logos with no meaning (context) attached to them irritates me to no end (actually kinda pisses me off).  As a software developer myself I don‚Äôt appreciate when developers do things to make themselves look clever.  It‚Äôs about the users not how clever you are.  Sorry rant over.,3

I went into the help menu to change the time but there was no option. I went through the menu and selected cancel in order to state a reason. I only wanted it to change the order to a later time. 

However, the order cancelled and charged me a delivery fee for $13. The total was $20. I contacted customer service but they told me since you cancelled it, you were charged the fee. I explained to them the app malfunctioning as well as the lack of an option to change the time, but they insisted that there was nothing I could do.

I am extremely disappointed by the accountability of Uber eats and will not use their service again. DoorDash has never been an issue for me and I only tired Uber eats because of a 50% promotion.

Highly inappropriate. Update: attempting to use the app without notifications means you also won‚Äôt receive any notice when Uber Eats randomly cancels an already confirmed order after the fact.

At 3:00 am the app told me the food would be arriving at 3:50 which was over an hour after the original delivery time.

With the increasing service fee and the disappearing discounts, I feel so disappointed towards the app. Customer services cannot explain their ‚Äúnewest Uber one loyalty program‚Äù properly; all they could say was ‚Äúah please check updates‚Äù.

They want you to pay extra or else they front load orders in front of your delivery so you get cold and soggy food. The delivery fees and taxes are crazy high. Sometimes $10 or more on a $25 order. After the tip, delivery fee and taxes you‚Äôre paying double the price for your food than what‚Äôs advertised. Also the orders are almost always ridiculously late. Sometimes more than an hour after what it predicts. Then when it gets there on time or a little earlier than predicted they send you a notification to tip more because it‚Äôs early.

I‚Äôve ordered maybe 10 times from them. Different places different drivers. MOST orders arrive cold. If I were at a restaurant and it were served to me I would leave and I would never come back. Maybe Uber customer service should take a look at the pretty sharp decline of Uber‚Äôs stock price. It‚Äôs not a coincidence.

And a different driver brought the food. Even after getting a refund for a non-delivery, I was still charged for a tip for the driver who never showed. After contacting Uber eats support, they tell me I had to remove the tip within one hour of the order for it not to be charged. we waited on our food for over an hour and a half and finally received it, however, the first driver was tipped for doing nothing. Uber eats would not refund the tip. if the order is not delivered, and a refund is issued, then why is a tip still allowed?",1

Repeatedly I will pay high fees for the delivery just to receive my product 15+ minutes later than promised, usually up to 45 if I receive my items at all. I have had to cancel a shocking amount of orders myself because delivery drivers will show up to the restaurant and not let me know there were issues with my order. I have grown more and more disappointed as I have continued to give this app chances. Never again.",2
ubereats,1058959277,2022-11-18 04:15:51,Never got my order and it still charged me,Uber not only lets people that can‚Äôt follow a gps deliver for them but they also have the worst customer support system I‚Äôve ever seen. My order never showed up after an hour of trying to get in touch with my delivery driver. The app wouldn‚Äôt let me cancel and then when I try to report my issue it takes another 30 minutes to get through to someone and then ends the chat on me. So I never got my order or a refund. This happened to me years ago as well and this was only the 4th time using the app since then. Just know if your order never comes don‚Äôt expect a refund,1

It‚Äôs almost impossible to get a refund for the difference of an incomplete order that the restaurant messed up; then they try to make you feel as if you‚Äôre getting over on them. I had to file complaints with the Better Business Bureau and email randomly executives just for a partial refund on an order. There‚Äôs been times when food arrived and items were missing and I didn‚Äôt report it because I didn‚Äôt feel like arguing with customers service. Once a month, I am forced to deal with Uber Eats or risk losing my monthly Uber credit from American Express.",1

The entree was $20 and they ‚Äúrefunded‚Äù me $5 uber cash. I don‚Äôt want uber cash, I want my money back! I had to wait an hour for my food just for it to be incomplete and inedible. Terrible service and there‚Äôs no way to contact customer service through the app about the problem, they just keep saying ‚Äúwe already refunded you $5 uber cash for this order‚Äù. To even USE the $5 I‚Äôd have to spend more of my own money! Literally try any other food delivery app because they will at least pretend to care about their customers experience.",1

They delivered a box of rotten food with an expiration date of more than ten days away.  We opened the box two days later (when we actually needed it) and saw it was rotten WITH a smell which we couldn‚Äôt see at delivery because the label covered the food- so we took photos of it.  Spent an hour texting support and getting no response on hold- then tracked down the number to call. They acknowledged it was rotten, but Ubereats wouldn‚Äôt refund the money even with the photos because we didn‚Äôt open the box for two days.   Use instacart instead- we never have this problem.",1

The picture that the driver took even showed it was at the wrong house. I find it very frustrating that they still charged me the full amount for the food and the full amount I tipped the driver even though I never received my food. I don‚Äôt appreciate just being out the money for a mistake that was not mine and that I could do nothing about. I will be warning everyone I know who uses Uber about this and encourage them to use a different service that I know will not charge their customers for items they don‚Äôt actually receive.,1

I can‚Äôt give somebody a $5-10 tip after paying for my food, the delivery fee, AND ‚Äútaxes and other‚Äù fees. Also instead of sending me 40% discounts every week on places I‚Äôve never eaten and never will, what would it hurt to give me that same 40% off the few I actually order from. Uber one is completely useless. ‚ÄúFree delivery on eligible stores‚Äù, but it doesn‚Äôt tell you all which stores(not that you have many to pick from) I love Uber eats delivery times and communication between drivers but everything else outweighs it all.",1

After getting my food it gave me an option to edit my tip, so I tried to change it from $5 to $10. Instead, it ADDED both and made it $15. I spoke with support TWICE and both time they claimed a ‚Äúspecialized‚Äù team must address this and closed the chat on me. I then get an email with OUTDATED instructions claiming I can manually change the tip, which USED to be the case but now it ONLY lets me add. I have not received follow up and will only use DoorDash for now on. Better prices for the SAME THING and more selections.",1

However I feel the actual owners of the app should treat the customers better. I waited 2 & a half hours for my breakfast during a slow time when everyone should be awake (8:30) they ended up canceling my order with no explanation or credit for the inconvenience.

No phone number to call except delivery person.  Who upon being notified of error notified Uber Eats.  The app said to go through app fir resolution.  No response except by email to go through app and also through email. Neither produced any results except saying they are not able to refund.

The Uber driver still took it upon herself to still get the items that I didn‚Äôt want which was the soup. They didn‚Äôt have chicken noodle soup so I said forget the soup she instead got clam chowder. I asked for AAA batteries but instead got AA Batteries.

I use both DoorDash and UberEats but I‚Äôve permanently deleted this app after too many bad experiences. The problem has never been with the restaurants - always the app communication and delivery. The last straw was paying premium delivery fees, having 3 different drivers scheduled, and food that was ‚Äòallegedly‚Äô delivered nearly an hour later, but in all actuality never arrived from driver #3.

But on my last order when my food arrived the paper bag was soaking and my food fell through and onto the sidewalk. I had cleaned it and through it in the trash at that very moment. After I cleaned up I went through the app to let them know about my issue and they said they could not refund me and there was nothing they can do. All they said was better luck next time.

Several times the delivery guy took my food and i recieved no solutions from the support team. I didnt even get the chance to rate the delivery guy. So obviously he's going to keep stealing the deliverys and uber eats is going to keep making millions at the expense of my cold food and the delivery guys salaries.

A week later as I‚Äôm  back at school trying to order food I find that they not only still charged my card for the full amount including the $5 tip I added for my delivery driver, but they also took another $5 tip from my Uber cash.

Manager picks up, hears me, and then hangs up

I call again and ask to escalate to a manager

I was told that's not how they structured their calls

I told them that's a lie, as it just happened to me

Customer service tried to threaten me by saying these calls are recorded 

I asked them to simply refund my order as the app clearly glitched

I was told I needed to pay $40

I hung up, got my delicious food, disputed the charge with my bank and won my refund

It costs Uber Eats 0 dollars to refund, since they don't technically own these restaurants. Greed kept them from refunding me so I had to get my money back the hard way

ubereats,1058959277,2022-11-30 22:16:11,Horrible experience with Uber Eats,Never received 2 milkshakes they refunded me for one of them but there was no option to explain I ordered 2 even though it was on the receipt!! every time I tried to report there was another item missing I just kept getting the same message that I‚Äôd already been refunded the entire amount of the order of 8.65$ lol the order was 65$ 8$ was the amount of the one milkshake so not only did I not get my shakes I still had to pay for them and no one even offered to go get 2 more for me no. This isn‚Äôt the first issue I‚Äôve had with Uber Eats but it will be the last,1

Over years with Door Dash we have only had a couple of issues.  This time our food was bad, the delivery was awful, and I ended up getting food poisoning.  Uber Eats would not help with the issue because the few times I have used them I have had problems.  That is a reflection of Uber East not me.  If they don‚Äôt want to adjust the price that‚Äôs fine I‚Äôm not super worried about it.  But their customer service is bad all around.  I should have known better and just used Door Dash.",1
ubereats,1058959277,2022-11-18 21:01:00,can be an unexpectedly bad experience,"normally the app is fine (it still almost always lies about delivery times). but out of my last 50 orders, about 5 times the driver doesn't go to the restaurant. just now it happened again. i ordered at 8pm and support forced me to wait until 9:30 before allowing me to cancel. it's absolutely silly to not be compensated after being hungry for 1.5 hours, you've basically given them a free loan in exchange for being hungry and a wrench thrown into your schedule. i even pay for Uber One. all the agents are fine, but the design of their customer service is pathetic",1
ubereats,1058959277,2022-12-07 20:57:43,Did I miss something?,"Been using grubhub cause Uber eats was way expensive a year or two ago. Now the delivery fee is 4$, the base prices seem lower, you can pay for 2$ faster delivery if you want. I might just use it regularly and not have a subscription to a service anymore. 4$ is reasonable and I won‚Äôt feel obligated to use it more because of the membership",5

We ordered a bunch of Chinese food for dinner, my fianc√©e didn‚Äôt have his meal. It took UberEats 2 days to respond and they said the order wasn‚Äôt eligible for refund. First reason was that the restaurant doesn‚Äôt offer refunds, then they said it was because we had requested too many refunds in the past - this was our first time ordering, we downloaded the app that day. They are no longer responding. Most other companies do what they can to do right by their customers.",1

The biggest issues I have are; orders in my cart disappear, items are unavailable for next day delivery, items are multiplied on the order, and lately many restaurants are unavailable, even if they are open. Ordering group meals has been frustrating to say the least and when I speak to a support agent I get no real good answer or my order gets screwed up even more.",2

The order should be allowed to be passed on to another driver instead of making the person order it wait 30 minutes, then cancelling the whole order and then having to redo the order just to wait another 30-45 minutes. This order was placed for someone who just got home from the hospital and could not drive. Drivers should not be allowed to cancel an entire order due to some issue on their part. Do better Uber.",1

I placed my order and was not able to edit it because of an app error. Also would not let me edit it on my computer or tablet because of errors. Reached out to customer service who told me to wait for delivery and then contact them again for a resolution. So I did. In no way is this the drivers fault, but Uber customer service told me there was nothing they could do because the order was complete. Want screen shots of the conversation?

My order (after paying extra for priority). They instead closed the chat on my face and gave me Uber cash. I am DONE with this app. We should all just go to restaurants for pickup (and save money) instead of supporting this unethical tech giant. I‚Äôll be doing that going forward and when I absolutely can‚Äôt make it to a restaurant, I‚Äôll be using door dash or anyone other than Uber!",1

They have absolutely no accountability for their vendors or drivers who deliver to PAYING customers that expect what they pay for! Deplorable. Then will tell you, absurdly, that they can‚Äôt rectify an incorrect order because it‚Äôs happened multiple times. Who‚Äôs fault is that!?!? It‚Äôs not the customer. Pick better vendors, or vet better deliverers, but don‚Äôt punish your customers! Like myself, who orders frequently for business trips. I think DoorDash just got a new customer.",1

After canceling the order i was charged for the entirety of the order stating ‚Äúthe food had already been made‚Äù when contacting customer support they said i had to pay for it even tho their driver said to cancel, i even provided proof and they still did not care.

I‚Äôve already rated the bakery involved, because the entire experience amounted to ‚Äúthis isn‚Äôt my problem‚Äù, and the customer service all around was a wild ride of indifference.

So now my $100 is tied up in ‚Äúprocessing‚Äù since they only put a hold on your card.

They did not give me any credits and when I was speaking with an agent (the agents name was Cesarlo) they did not address my issues and took awhile to actually respond to me.

I accepted and it got postponed another 10 mins to 40 mins. The ironic part was that by the time I left the spot they finally sent a driver.

Within the past 4-5 years the user interface has created an entirely toxic tipping culture. I do not, and will never tip before my order is delivered. Tips are optional and percentage is based on the quality of work. It seems agents find it to be acceptable to not deliver orders when there is a low tip, or zero tip applied BEFORE it‚Äôs delivered. It‚Äôs wrong to ask a customer to tip before the order is delivered, it‚Äôs almost as if you‚Äôre suggesting it‚Äôs required? Fix this please.",1

I deserve a full refund! Food was cold also! Ridiculous and never again!! This has happened a few times through Uber Eats so I do believe I will use someone different!!

ubereats,1058959277,2022-09-11 01:00:30,Horrible Customer Service,I had an order cancelled by two different drivers without an explanation after waiting for over an hour for my food. I called to complain and get some explanation and recieved no help from Uber‚Äôs customer service. Maybe if Uber paid their drivers enough we could get decent service and I wouldn‚Äôt have had to complain. Instead they rip off users and don‚Äôt provide any decent assistance when you call. Deleting both Uber apps since I refuse to give them any more of my money if they can‚Äôt provide consistent service.,1

They charged me 21 dollars worth of food and I didn‚Äôt even order anything‚Ä¶ I didn‚Äôt get a refund. I checked my email to see if I accidentally charged myself but no receipt. And I have checked my past orders but there‚Äôs nothing with a charge of 21 dollars within that day it was taken from my account. I called they did help me out but they told me to send them a screenshot of my charger and since then I haven‚Äôt heard anything from them. No emails no refunds not even Uber cash.,1

Even if your order is cancelled by the app or merchant as soon as you place it there is still a 3-10 day authorization hold on the money that twice now has ended up sticking.

The app was glitching and I couldn‚Äôt see the tracking. No one accepted the delivery that I could see from my end. I definitely would use a different ordering app because how the agent handled it was unprofessional and rude. It should not take over an hour for a drink that is 12 minutes away. I am very frustrated and would not recommend it to anyone due to how the agent handled it. I am paying money for a service to deliver food.,1

They‚Äôre allowed to change it to a higher number based on some ‚Äúlimited access program‚Äù (which I was not informed at all before placing order).

ubereats,1058959277,2022-10-11 21:03:23,How to trick Uber to pay you more $$$,"Here‚Äôs how I‚Äôve manage to get over $200 a day for driving just 5-6 hours:

When you get a notification from Uber, check at the amount you will be receiving for the delivery. 

If the offer is below $10, do yourself a favor and do NOT accept!!!! This is their way to cheat you out on a good offer.

What will end up happening is that they will increase the amount of $$$.

When no one accepts the small amount of $$$ Uber or the buyer of the food will be forced to increase the amount of the offer.

When everyone follows this rule of thumb, everyone doing deliveries will be expecting a higher pay. 

Or else Uber eats will go broke.

Moral to the story?

Don‚Äôt say yes to everything.

Know your worth ( your time and efforts )
And stick to it.

Let‚Äôs go ahead and make this paper!! $$$$$",2

ubereats,1058959277,2022-09-28 16:39:58,"It‚Äôs great, when it works.",Some of the restaurants allow you to order from them and then cancel your order. Uber doesn‚Äôt hold them accountable so the experience becomes frustrating and bad for the drivers. This is why Door Dash is winning 8 out of 10 times. Customers should be aware that restaurants have stipulations before ordering and UberEats should hold them to terms and conditions. What‚Äôs the point of being on a major platform if you can‚Äôt place high volume orders??,2

Drivers deliver to wrong place and not held accountable. Orders not complete. And then they won‚Äôt refund or send another order to you. PLEASE HELP STOP THIS SCAM! Delete app and leave bad review on google play or App Store. This company is stealing money from you! Up charging all products by double and you will not get your order full 90% of the time and now will not get refunded.

We contacted Ubereats to confirm they were verifying these transactions before we fulfilled them. UE said yes orders are verified, these are UE customers and to please fulfill orders. 

-We don‚Äôt have access to customer info to double check, so we fulfilled orders.

The driver upon delivery is supposed to verify customer name and age before hand off. If there‚Äôs a discrepancy, the item is supposed to be returned to the store at the customers expense.

We eventually process $3500 in orders of high end items. Uber subsequently contacts us days later to inform us our account is closed and we won‚Äôt be receiving payments due to fraud.

I tried to dispute it and got locked in a spiral of automated email responses and customer service reps that direct you to the email which generates an automatic denial response.

The communication is so far below what should be ethically acceptable to be considered a business. 
REPEATED cancelled orders where the DRIVER now has a hot meal for themselves. No responsibility for the people THEY HAVE DRIVING FOR THEM, that they ‚Äúhire‚Äù. 
Wasted time again and again, orders cancelled after an hour wait when delivery is scheduled for 10 minutes or less. 
Or better yet, turfed to FOUR different drivers because the first TOOK the food for themselves and then left the app. Assigned to next driver. And so on. 
Uber eats and Uber have lost Uber One/Gold (or whatever crap they call it) users/subscribers. 

Waste of time and money and resources, restaurants fed up with it as well, offering to REMAKE it for a discount because they physically handed to it to, in the case of tonight, Brian. Two minutes prior to our inquiry.

Very disappointing when this happens! 
I love Ubereats but I need an option to change my tip like they use to have. I tip well to encourage and help delivery drivers and for good service but if I do it beforehand cannot alter it even if they fail to deliver.
I always tip beforehand because or else drivers would take up to 30 minutes to an hour to get here and the food would be cold.

Even when ordering from a place with ‚Äúfree delivery‚Äù and having an unlimited membership, there are still a ton of extra fees. Restaurants also get paid 30% less when people use Postmates to order so the restaurants also jack up their prices to cover their losses. Who pays for all of this? You/us! If you ever have a problem with your order, don‚Äôt expect any help from customer service. They use an automated service first, then pass you off to someone over seas that copy/pastes boiler-plate responses. Use another food service company..any other company, actually. This is by far the worst. We are done and have deleted the app, once and for all.",1
postmates,512393983,2022-09-30 15:40:58,"Terrible support, scammers","I made an order for a pretty large group of people at work. After multiple delays the delivery personally finally showed up at the drop off location, marked my order ‚ÄúDelivered‚Äù, and left. Shortly after she messaged me saying that she didn‚Äôt bring the food because the restaurant cancelled the order. 

I sent this to Postmates support along with screenshots of the message from the delivery person herself saying that she never got the food. After a lot of back and forth they said they were sorry but because the delivery driver showed up at the delivery location, they were unable to give me a refund. 

I paid for food not for someone to show up at the drop off location empty handed. This is after spending thousands on large orders through the app. Very disappointed with this level of service, and I won‚Äôt be using this app again.",1

I contacted customer service and they fixed it. Fine. But then I placed an order last Friday and once again my order was missing food. I was told that nothing could be done for me as I had already had a partial refund in the past. Excuse me? So now that I have another bad order you decide to completely alienate me from ever using the app again by telling me you won‚Äôt help? And to top it off, you told me to go review the driver as a way of alerting you to my bad experience? So you want the driver to take the blame? 

I am deleting the app, reporting you to BBB, and opening a PayPal dispute since you think you can take my money and not provide me the food I ordered. Never again.",1

Sent back a message saying that I could re order again online. I assume that is an automatic email response they had. I asked to speak to a supervisor after multiple times asking how much the refund was for and another agent entered the chat and said that a supervisor wouldn‚Äôt be available for 2 hours.

On top of that, half of the drivers can‚Äôt speak, or read English, so it doesn‚Äôt matter if I write instructions on where to leave the food. The last time I ordered food, it was for my office, and it explicitly stated to walk inside the building and hand it to me or put it on the front desk. Instead, the driver went to the totally wrong door and left the food outside in the cold and rain. On top of that, there is no way to adjust the tip or to conveniently take away the tip when they failed to do their job appropriately. I‚Äôm sorry, but I do not feel I should have to tip a person for not doing an appropriate job in the first place. If they can‚Äôt do their job, they don‚Äôt deserve tip. This is coming from a person who worked in the service industry for a very long time. There was even one time, when I ordered my food, and the driver brought me the completely wrong order. Since it was later in the evening, I was not able to have the food order corrected. DoorDash did refund me my money, but I was still screwed on food for that night. It‚Äôs just not worth it unless you‚Äôre in a desperate situation.",2
doordash,719972451,2022-11-07 04:36:03,Good for consumers bad for dashers.,"I have been both a consumer and dasher and it‚Äôs very convenient for a consumer if you are willing to pay the extra fee but it‚Äôs also hard to tip so much extra for the dasher to make it worth while. As a previous dasher I know that it is hard to even call it a side hustle. Most consumers are reluctant to leave a tip and when they do it‚Äôs minimal, but I understand as a consumer that it‚Äôs hard to pay a big tip when you order something and the price is twice as much as item you paid for just because door dash charges extra. Then you have you tile the driver because trust be they don‚Äôt make much without a tip. Please tip big for these dashers if they do a good job so there is more value in it. Remember, door dah doesn‚Äôt pay for gas, insurance, maintenance or anything. Yes dashers get a tax write off but it‚Äôs not exactly the same. 

Also, if you are a dasher you may want to try instacart instead if it is popular in your city. Especially in the winter. It‚Äôs pays better and it keeps you more active throughout the day. I made way more doing instacart when I was trying both. Around $20 and hour. Again you are an independent contractor so you can get write offs. I personally wrote off all of my taxes as a instacarter and make about 40,000 a year gross income.",4
doordash,719972451,2022-09-24 00:10:33,Customer service is a disaster,"I placed an order, two drivers bailed out on the order due to having to wait an extra ten minutes. Mind you we tip a ridiculous amount both being in the service industry. So, someone picks up the order drops it off and runs away. 100% incorrect order. Missing all four drinks/shakes and I don‚Äôt know the 2nd bag of the order. 100% under the wrong name‚Ä¶ my name brings with and E not and A. Call customer service and told 100% will go back to the card‚Ä¶. It didn‚Äôt. So I contact them and of course there is NOTHING THEY CAN DO. This man I spoke to via text convo, told me to calm down said I was too excited and maybe I had personal problems to be upset that I was lied to again. I have loads of screenshots where I was Insulted and pretty much called a p.o.s. By someone who refused to apply the credit to my card and not an app credit. I was then promised 30+ dollars in a gift card multiple times and got a wait for it 5.00 credit‚Ä¶ when asking to speak with someone higher up or idk maybe over the phone I was told I was old and to get with the times. No on talks on the phone anymore. I am sure the BBB would LOVE to know they are lying about their return policy and method of payment. Customer service is disgusting and a total waste of time. Just don‚Äôt use the app. Just drive to the place. Give the money to the restaurant directly. Crappy drivers are one thing. Bad customer service is a company approved problem.",1
doordash,719972451,2022-11-13 12:09:58,Sick of delivery issues,I‚Äôve used DoorDash quite frequently over the past two years. However lately it seems I‚Äôm having more more issues with my food not being delivered to the correct address or Dashers picking up other orders and my food getting here extremely late. That has even happened when I‚Äôve ordered things such as ice cream. I think the worst part about it is that some of these Dashers do not respond to your calls or messages. I could easily direct them to my house which is not at all difficult to find. GPS takes anyone directly to my driveway which is only 15 feet long. for a long time my orders often came without the drinks. Therefore I stopped ordering drinks. But now there seems to be issues more and more. The worst part is often times I only get partial refunds when a delivery does not go well. Or when the delivery is delivered to an entirely different place I get offered to have it re-delivered. But then the new Dasher ended up still picking up somebody else‚Äôs order before mine and then came to my neighborhood with blaring music that caused some of my neighbors to step outside. Very embarrassing. I was afraid to even complain about the loud music as this person obviously knows where I live. All these issues coupled with the high prices make this no longer worth the trouble. therefore I have deleted the app and will no longer be using.,2
doordash,719972451,2022-11-17 19:01:32,Incredibly frustrating experience,"I‚Äôve had doordash for a couple of years now, but over the past couple of months it has become an incredibly frustrating experience. When I order food for delivery, many times they‚Äôll have more than one other person to deliver before me, so I get cold food when it arrives even when the driver has thermal equipment to keep the food in. When I order for pick up, the app gets incredibly confusing. It constantly suggest locations to me that are not the closest, and the address for the place doesn‚Äôt even show up until the check out. And then I go to my usual location thinking it‚Äôs fine since I‚Äôve order from those places many times before only to find out it‚Äôs a whole other location I‚Äôve never been to. There are no warnings or anything to tell you this isn‚Äôt the closest location when you‚Äôre ordering, and if it‚Äôs frustrating for a person that is used to apps, I can‚Äôt imagine how infuriating it would be for more technologically challenged people. On top of that, when restaurants have gotten my orders wrong, I‚Äôm only given a partial refund for my order even though I now have a meal I can‚Äôt eat. I originally got this app because it was cheaper than uber eats with decent service, but now the prices are about the same so I don‚Äôt see a point anymore. Really disappointed.",2
doordash,719972451,2022-11-11 22:56:53,I‚Äôm so over it.,"Honestly used to love DoorDash. I‚Äôm going to give it a 2 because it was recently at a 1. The only reason for that is 1 star for the restaurants because they always make the food on point and it‚Äôs usually never them. The second star is because Door Dash used to be good. But what in the world has been going on with the past deliveries. 
Every delivery that I have placed in the past 2-3 months has been so terrible and it‚Äôs been about 6 times. This is definitely my last as I‚Äôm currently waiting AGAIN for more than 1 hour for my food all because of other deliveries. 
What‚Äôs the point of ordering food and calling yourself door dash if you aren‚Äôt going to be either of those things? 
The food has been taking at least 2 hours every time to be delivered. The longest I‚Äôve waited was 2 hours and 45 minutes!!! 
I‚Äôm not sure if it‚Äôs the drivers or door dash but I do not want to return as a customer because this is simply ridiculous. They pass right by your house. It‚Äôs not even like they go to a spot down the block, you see them jumping on high way and are stuck where it is they probably have went. Oh and then when you ask, half the time they never respond. There has to be a better algorithm or your going to lose your customers!!! If I wanted to wait 3 hours for food, I can go walk and pick it up!",2
doordash,719972451,2022-10-12 21:01:10,BEWARE FOR NO FAIR REFUND & SOLUTIONS,"Long term users subjected to dishonest dashing, may not receive fair services or compensation for dishonest deliveries. In my experience to recent events deliveries have been miss delivered to wrong complexes or apartments. Due to this issue i‚Äôve had re-ordered, sometimes repeating the miss delivery. However, some dashers call the customers to make sure the order is in your possession by the correct building, floor and apt. In my last order DoorDash has miss delivered and denied any sort of refund or help. In contacting support, all I‚Äôm told is that they cannot process any sort of ‚Äútransaction and there‚Äôs nothing they can do for me‚Äù However there is many things that can be done. Such as a photo of the door with the food and apt #. Then, I‚Äôd at least know where to find my order, but they rather say they can‚Äôt offer me money as the first and only solution leaving a sour taste in my mouth and a distrust in what they think of me and letting me know they see me as a dishonest customer or that my issues are below them. Id hope they reinforce dashers to check customer notes for delivery help. After getting in contact with many agents from DoorDash for the past two weeks they denied any sort of help or use of my account and I never get any updates about my $43 purchase. I‚Äôm not willing to ever use DoorDash again. Especially when I never had an issue using Uber eats.",1
doordash,719972451,2022-10-22 00:36:27,No problem‚Äôs really‚Ä¶ lol they‚Äôre great just one thing,"The app is easy to use and has a way better format than the other delivery services I‚Äôve used. True to delivery time(except for when it‚Äôs out of their control), delivery drivers have been great. If I was to have an issue with the quality of food it is very easy to get the issues resolved no headache! I‚Äôm just waiting on additional restaurants to be added lol I‚Äôm a foodie!

Only thing is there GPS is off. Idk if it‚Äôs my address specifically but every time they have an issue finding my apt and spend 5 min trying to find my apt. When on my end it shows exactly where I‚Äôm at. And yes I‚Äôve worked were I lived for 4 years the address is correct it shows on my end my exact building but it just never brings them here unfortunately. I always receive a call after them circling the property for 5 min trying to figure out where I‚Äôm at. Even had a delivery driver having issues trying to complete the order because the app said they were far away from the delivery address but they were speaking to me at the doorway‚Ä¶ Other than this they are great!",5
doordash,719972451,2022-09-30 15:10:27,Mixed experience,"Experience from Sept 2022:  I set up a group order with a scheduled delivery date and time a couple days out on DoorDash. The day we needed it to be delivered,I finalize the order first thing in the morning. The date and time I preset was noon on that particular day. When I closed the order, it sent it to the restaurant and dasher immediately.  It was delivered within 30 minutes - 2 1/2 hours before our scheduled lunch meeting time and before the time I entered when I set up the pre-scheduled delivery. If the app is not going to remember a pre-scheduled delivery time, don‚Äôt make that an option. It risks food spoilage.  

Experience from last year:  DoorDash works out great when it works out. However, the instructions for placing group orders are nebulous and not all restaurants have a group order link but it doesn‚Äôt really say why. Also didn‚Äôt know that a restaurant we tried to order with had $100 max. Would‚Äôve been nice to know that before I entered $176 worth of items. Had to go back to the team to reassess who wanted what. Lunch was late because of that. That was after they are placed an order with one restaurant that turned out to be closed that day. Like I said‚Ä¶ When it works it‚Äôs fabulous, and when we have today‚Äôs experience, not so much.",2

I have either not received my order, received incorrect items or received items late. I have been ‚Äúflagged‚Äù because of their inadequate service. I have had to call my bank multiple times because of the situation. The latest situation was my requesting cut watermelon and receiving a whole watermelon. I‚Äôm in a hotel and cannot do anything with that! I cannot say it enough please stay away from this inconsistent service.  They will refuse to refund you for their errors, you cannot be transferred to a supervisor and have to wait for a callback, you will spend hours on the phone trying to resolve their errors. I think I have only received 2 orders that were correct and all the other ones were incorrect in one way or another. Their customer service representatives all use the same canned script when you call to notify them of their errors. After this latest error I have decided to use a different service. Word of mouth is the most powerful form of advertising and I plan to share my experiences with as many people I can. If you look online there are countless lawsuits against them.  Terrible service, unempowered customer service representatives and they put their customers last.  Terrible.",1

Lately tho it just hasn‚Äôt been pulling through I get you guys get busy at certain times but lately there‚Äôs been a lot of problems a lot of the time it‚Äôs a struggle to even get a dasher or when I do get assigned a dasher the communication between the company and the dasher is so poor that my food was almost delivered across town. I really enjoy the services normally so it‚Äôs sad to see if not live up. It‚Äôs crazy how much more expensive it is to order through DoorDash and the customer support is literally the worst customer support I‚Äôve ever seen ninety percent of the time they don‚Äôt actually do anything to really help you I had to wait an hour and a half just to get McDonald‚Äôs. If I had the extra time to make my own food at home or go out then I would more then gladly but it‚Äôs not always that easy.

doordash,719972451,2022-12-21 00:54:49,Poor Service,"This service is sometimes terrible and the company just doesn‚Äôt care. I ordered from a local restaurant tonight. After having my delivery time moved later and later for 45 minutes with no response from my driver, I inquired with a live Door Dash customer service rep as to the whereabouts of my order.  While they were giving me a bunch or corporate speak about how they take food freshness and temperature so seriously, the dasher texted me to say that they were given a second delivery from the same restaurant that was taking longer than mine.  I mean the restaurant is 15 minutes away.  They could have delivered and returned to the restaurant easily enough.  While I appreciated the response from the dasher, it was completely opposite everything the customer service rep was telling me.  When I let the customer service rep know that the dasher contradicted them, they immediately ended and deleted the thread.  About 10 minutes later the dasher brought my food with an apology.  The food was 45 minutes old‚Ä¶not good.  Honestly I‚Äôve had both good and bad experiences but you should know that there will be times they ruin your evening and they really don‚Äôt care.  I‚Äôm sure they have a well crafted response to posts like this but they just don‚Äôt really care about the customer or your experience.",1
doordash,719972451,2022-09-30 21:52:05,Remove Multiple Orders Feature,"Some time after coming out DoorDash added the feature for dashers to ‚Äúcomplete other orders nearby‚Äù. Then after creating this problem where the customers food gets cold, DoorDash ‚Äúsolved the problem‚Äù by allowing the customer to pay extra for direct delivery. It‚Äôs ridiculous to ask the customer to pay extra to solve the problem you created. Numerous times I‚Äôve gotten cold food regardless of how good the driver is. Sometimes the nearby customer won‚Äôt come to their door, or the ‚Äúnearby order‚Äù isn‚Äôt nearby at all. If it wasn‚Äôt for the fact that I enjoy hot food, this wouldn‚Äôt be a problem, I can wait a little longer for my food, but it gets cold. Without this feature I would give DoorDash five stars as a customer, until then it‚Äôs two. I assume the multiple orders feature was only added to appease the dashers who weren‚Äôt being payed properly. But maybe instead of putting that onto the customer you just pay your dashers fairly.

Side note, I would also love if they could add a feature to see the car your dasher is driving, a color and make or something. I live in a city where the dashers have a hard time finding me, and I‚Äôd love to be able to pick out their car and wave them over.",2

I contacted DD Customer service and asked them to please send out another dasher to deliver my order since the wrong order was delivered. I was told they couldn‚Äôt do that. I said they need to send my order or refund the full amount paid and again I was told my request was denied due to previous compensation. Mind you this so called compensation I received previously was nearly $800 charged to my credit card that I in no way charged and could not find any of these charges on my DD account. As a matter of fact I was told by one of their customer service reps that sometimes this happens and unfortunately people hack into their system and steal customer information. So not only is our information not secure but basically because my bank‚Äôs fraud department investigated and found these charges were not mine DD has decided to steal my money when there is mistakes made by the restaurant. I guess from now on I just need to pick up my own stuff. It‚Äôs obvious this company are not honest and put us at risk any time we use them of having our cards charged outrageous amounts. For all I know it was DD themselves or one of their many rude customer service representatives that charged nearly $800 to my card!,1

I forgot to cancel my dash pass and they attempted to take 10 dollars from me for it. Lucky there was nothing in the bank account they tried to take it from. The only reason it wasn‚Äôt canceled prior is because I would have lost my free trail to the dash pass. The company is deliberately trying to take advantage of people that forget to cancel. After they tried to steal 10 dollars from me, for a service I had no intentions of renewing or spending money on, there was no option to cancel the dash pass. I contacted support and they were so pathetically worthless. I wouldn‚Äôt have to be worried about being charged but I received an email today saying they tried to steal my money again! I‚Äôd already deleted the account too and it forfeited the change I had left over from a gift card. That‚Äôs how badly I just wanted to be done with them. They‚Äôre still trying to steal my money! They‚Äôre criminals! I even replied to the initial email they sent me about the failed payment. I replied to cancel it, it said in the email, I could reply there. Such a worthless support system!

Driver didn‚Äôt contact you and then dropped your food off at some other unknown location? Well, DoorDash will happily keep your money. It‚Äôs not worth the risk. If you have the ability to, get in your car and go to the restaurant. DoorDash does not compensate their drivers fairly, literally steals money from customers, and their business practices are harmful to smaller restaurants. They are the worst choice for food delivery and should be avoided at all costs. DoorDash overall is a nice concept, but the execution is poor here. Their delivery fees are understandable, however they don‚Äôt do anything to stop drivers from taking your food or to insure that drivers are incentivized enough to get your order. My most recent purchase was completely wrong to the fault of the restaurant. Unfortunately, I had to go through DoorDash to rectify this. They credited me for the burger, but no the large $3.99 delivery fee. The food I received I physically couldn‚Äôt even eat, yet DoorDash still passes the cost along to the consumer. They‚Äôre very anti-consumer, and they aren‚Äôt great to the drivers either with deliveries that take up to 30 minutes for $2.",1

The only way to cancel is by calling, I did so and got confirmation of the cancellation yet I was still charged. Called again, they transferred me 3 times for literally no reason and eventually sent me to the post call survey. The first woman on the phone was yelling at me about how there was no cancellation in their system when I repeatedly stated that I had an email saying the opposite. They want me to provide the date of the charge, card number, exact amount‚Ä¶my apple credit card doesn‚Äôt have numbers and I shouldn‚Äôt have to go through the trouble of finding one, whatever that process may look like. How could it be possible that they don‚Äôt have the information themselves!? They have no issue taking my money but it seem like the customer service employees are trained to be horrible and do whatever they can to never give money back. Be aware of this SCAM!

They can‚Äôt follow instructions, deliver it to the wrong location, are impossible to get ahold of, and then are incredibly rude about helping you when it comes to fixing their mistakes. I will no longer use the app but beware a lot of restaurants still use doordash as a third party delivery service. So even if you order from the restaurant directly, it‚Äôs doordash that delivers it and then it is even more difficult to fix issues the driver‚Äôs cause, because the restaurant will tell you to call doordash and doordash will tell you they can‚Äôt help you since you didn‚Äôt place the order through their app. Granted they are good about issuing refunds, but a lot of the time I don‚Äôt need or want the money back, I just want my order delivered correctly. Also the doordash subscription is purposely very easy to sign up for. I can‚Äôt tell you how many times I‚Äôve accidentally hit that button and didn‚Äôt know it until my account was being drafted. It happened on my work credit card once and they don‚Äôt issue refunds so I had to pay my company back the money out of my pocket.

Read all notifications - food prepared, finally after over an hour, it said driver almost there. Kept waiting. The order was still open. I contacted the driver theough chat. As soom as I texted, she closed the order. By the time I complained and got refunded, the restaurant was closed. I was shaking with fury. The driver took the food and went home without a word! I used every option on DD to complain and tell them this story - to give the company a chance to repair damages in this very unhappy customer‚Äôs eyes. Cuz what they did was pretty bad under the circumstances. Nothing. No apology from customer service, no response to multiple messages of complaint, zilch!

The app is generally functional and looks nice (if a bit busy from all the deals up top that I have no interest in), but it was an infuriating experience trying to browse through available restaurants. Every time I clicked on a restaurant and spent more than a few seconds looking at its offerings, hitting ‚Äúback‚Äù arrow( not ‚Äúreset‚Äù!) would send me back to the top of the Home page with my filters wiped. This makes finding and trying new places inconvenient and an exercise in patience. If I‚Äôm being cynical, maybe the idea is to make it so annoying to do so that the user just gives up and settles for whatever sponsored restaurants are at the top of the Home page, if they don‚Äôt just give up on DoorDash. I used UberEats primarily before (and I hate to pull out the comparison card), but while it has its own issues, I‚Äôve apparently been taking for granted being able to scroll through even a list of restaurants while checking out their menus‚Äîin a food ordering app.",3

I‚Äôve also had them literally forget 95% of my order at the restaurant, refuse to refund the delivery fee or the 25% tip I gave. I had ordered a pizza from Farrelli‚Äôs and a side salad, I only received the side salad, the delivery driver dropped it at my door, didn‚Äôt knock and took off. Tried to call them to tell them they forgot the majority of my order and ignored my calls. Went to pick it up myself, was told by Farrelli‚Äôs that DoorDash should refund me, it is separate from my order and they have no part in it. The DoorDash customer service person was entirely useless, told me it‚Äôs not on them and they can‚Äôt refund me and to figure it out with Farrelli‚Äôs. I just gave up because it was only $14 and I had already wasted 45 minutes on the phone with DoorDash.

You can barely scroll down the page it is super slow and glitchy, and if you do manage to get an order in it‚Äôs even harder to do double dash because the menus for other store just will not open, it only lets me choose from the quick menu options that are right there immediately but if I try to open a stores page my app freezes and I have to re open. I normally like to get a 2 liter from 7-11 any time I order a meal and double dash was perfect for that but now it‚Äôs so much of a hassle that it‚Äôs not even worth it.

I received a text saying the driver was approaching with my order but she was not here and it was never delivered. I context customer support, and for as much sweet talking they do, they did not help me. I was transferred to another agent seven times, which caused them to completely misunderstand my issue. I was told I only spent $30 and would only be refunded that, and I showed them the email with proof that I paid $50. I was ignored, and I received an email saying my order from the DAY BEFORE, from WALGREENS, was refunded. The second I said ‚Äúwait, that not the right order‚Äù, I was dropped by the chat and had to do it all over again. I did eventually get an agent who actually listened to me and helped me get my refund, but I don‚Äôt know if the driver ever faced consequences. I was already struggling enough with money, now I‚Äôm down another $50 until my refund comes in and I had to go to work with no food. I don‚Äôt like writing reviews but this feels very deserved.",1
doordash,719972451,2022-10-25 18:41:01,Worst Food Delivery App,"I don‚Äôt typically write reviews for apps, but I just had to let everyone know how unreliable this app is. I‚Äôve used DoorDash a total of 4 times and they have messed up my order 3 of those 4 times. I am vegetarian and cannot eat any meat, and every time they tend to give me meat dishes instead of the vegetarian dishes I had ordered. I end up having to throw my food away. The ‚Äúcredits‚Äù they issue when they mess up your order don‚Äôt compensate for the money lost; for example, I ordered one dish from a restaurant and my total (after taxes, tip, etc.) ended up being around $20. When they messed up my order and gave me a meat dish, which I had to throw away, they only gave me $4 in ‚Äúcredits.‚Äù Even when I called customer service, they failed to give me a full refund and got away with only giving me $10 back. I essentially lost $10 through no fault of my own. Not only is this app a waste of money, it‚Äôs a waste of time. Waiting an hour for your food just for it to be inedible and without even being fairly compensated for the mistake time after time is exhausting. Don‚Äôt bother using DoorDash and stick to other apps like Grubhub. Even though it‚Äôs more expensive, at least they never messed up my order.",1

Here lately I have multiple orders in a row where my Dasher either never makes it to the store or they go somewhere way out of the way. The last two orders I have placed both had to be canceled. One was for the Dollar General two miles down the road from where I was working and the Dasher parked across the street from the store for over an hour, at least that's what I could see on the map. Ultimately he never went inside and the store closed and I had to talk to customer service for a refund because the app refused to refund me due to the ""order already being started."" Then tonight I ordered from one of my favorite restaurants and the driver drove almost to the next town over and didn't move for more than 30 minutes before finally I get a call saying there was an emergency and my order was canceled. Gotta say I'm pretty angry about it.",4

It said I can pick up in 40 min, so I walked away to do other things during this time. When I came back, Doordash said my order is canceled. I called the restaurant to find out why and was told Doordash attached a nuts allergy note to my order and they can't honor it. This is the second time this happened. I start chat support with Doordash to get them to remove it. After spending more than an hour with Doordash chat support, I was told they can't remove it, that I have to remove it, and I can do it via Settings -> blue pencil icon. I didn't see it and asked them where it is, starting from iOS app home page. They again can not answer and transferred me twice to special departments and ultimately has to open up a case to try to answer my question. What a disaster. Eight different people via chat support and everyone just reads from a script and no one actually knows where this mythical Settings button is. The app is so poorly designed and causes time to be unnecessarily wasted, leaving you angry and still hungry. Ultimately it can't even do what it's made to do, which is to order food and make sure you get it.",1

Their customer service used to be very good. Over the last few months it has gotten terrible. The orders are late and cold because your dasher is waiting at the restaurant for multiple orders and delivering more than one order at a time. The dasher was rude when I messaged him regarding my concern for the food quality for the late delivery. When you try to contact customer service it gets worse. My last experience was when I was disconnected by a rude agent via chat before my issue was resolved. Then my food showed up late and cold with one whole meal missing. When I recontacted the service they told me the only thing they could do for me was refund the missing meal. They wouldn‚Äôt even do a reorder of the meal. They offered $5 as compensation which was insulting and they didn‚Äôt even give it to me. Then, when I asked to talk to a supervisor I was told it would take 2-24 hours because they were not available. When I did get a call there was ‚Äúnothing they could do‚Äù but report the issue. I‚Äôm extremely dissatisfied with DoorDash and I will never use them again. Horrible Service, just awful.",1
doordash,719972451,2022-10-29 04:54:06,"Ordered a chicken sandwich, got a pizza","Very disappointed. We placed an order for two chicken sandwiches from our favorite local restaurant. Our delivery driver knocked on the door and when we opened it, there was a pizza left on our porch from a different restaurant close by. We tried calling DoorDash, and after waiting on hold for an excessive amount of time and going back and forth between people, we were refunded. I know it seems silly, but we had just had pizza from the restaurant the pizza was from, and we really wanted the sandwiches we ordered! Unfortunately, that restaurant was closing in 5 minutes after we were finished with the phone call with DoorDash (which took a very long time, at least 45 minutes), so they weren‚Äôt taking anymore orders. I‚Äôm not able to write a review on the dasher because the order was placed through the restaurant‚Äôs website who (I guess) uses doordash for delivery. I called the restaurant and they said they were having trouble with doordash today, but there was nothing they could do (which is incorrect, and part of the reason I‚Äôm writing this). If there‚Äôs any way I can review the driver please let me know. I haven‚Äôt had many problems with doordash but this was lame.",1
doordash,719972451,2022-11-18 03:39:58,Good but not great,"It‚Äôs very frustrating to me that DoorDash drivers try to fit as many orders as they can in one run because that‚Äôs how they get paid the best. Tonight I ordered food that was supposed to be delivered at 7:12pm, but it didn‚Äôt actually get delivered until 7:35pm. I watched my driver go from the restaurant that had my food to a location 3 miles from me, to another location, back to the location 3 miles from me, to another place, and then finally to me all the while the driver had my food. I just think that DoorDash could do better about delivery time estimates. I got a text from the app at 7:09pm saying ‚Äúyour driver is close by‚Äù so I went outside, but then I looked at my app and realized my driver was delivering other dashes nearby. I finally went back inside and waited for my driver to text me. I don‚Äôt blame the driver, I know they‚Äôre doing their best and making money. I just wish the app would TELL me all of this before it confirms my order to be delivered at 7:12pm. I really think it‚Äôs the fault of the app and people paying the drivers. It‚Äôs in no way the drivers fault.",3

doordash,719972451,2022-12-13 16:07:42,Sigh‚Ä¶,"I think Door Dash should switch some things around. The first thing they should do is switch the order of the process. I think the restaurant AND dasher should accept your order before it‚Äôs prepared. The second thing they should do is allow you to switch your order from delivery to pick up if it‚Äôs taking too long or if the order hasn‚Äôt been accepted by a dasher. 

For example, I ordered breakfast from a place about 15 minutes from my house. Door Dash accepted the order and I got a notification that it was being made. 45 minutes went by before a dasher even accepted my order. Then I had to wait for them to arrive. I was already aware I was taking a risk by ordering a hot drink with whipped cream but was disappointed knowing that it sat 45 minutes and was going to be a flop regardless. My food was cold and subpar. While waiting, I looked through the app to see if I could switch it to pick up since it had been so long and no one accepted the order yet but couldn‚Äôt find that option. I would have been better off picking it up.",3

My food never even showed up and door dash only gave me half the money back for never getting the food I paid for. I clicked the purchase order again, and it ordered 2 of the item that was never delivered. I payed for this item 3 times and now have one extra I didn‚Äôt want. All in the same date night, my girlfriend doesn‚Äôt get her order either, and instead, gets an unseals McDonalds bag with a 10 piece nugget (with only 9 nuggets remaining) and a soda with no sticker seal on it. Absolutely disgusting. It‚Äôs embarrassing that my girlfriend was given that food for our ‚Äúdate night‚Äù. It doesn‚Äôt stop there. She puts a complaint and gets a free new delivery. This one is delivered two houses down from where she is. My girlfriend being the kind soul she is says forget it and it‚Äôs fine and let‚Äôs it go with no new complaint because she doesn‚Äôt want to be ‚Äúbothersome‚Äù.",1
doordash,719972451,2022-10-26 22:50:51,No refund and No food,"It‚Äôs really inconvenient when your told one thing by a dasher or rep on the phone and there is not upper management to oversee the issues. My daughter order food and when she noticed the order went to my brothers address she called to change the address. They stated she could not change the address which was fine. But they advised her they would cancel the order and she would receive a refund. After a week and no refund I called. They state that since the order was cancelled and the food was picked up that she would not receive her 42$ back. My brother verified that the dasher never delivered the order. So you mean to tell me she loses 42$ and the dasher just got free Chick-fil-A? That‚Äôs doesn‚Äôt seem right, they should still be required to deliver the order to the address listed because I would have driven to get it.  It has now been 3 weeks, after calling in 3 times and still not receiving a call back in 24 hrs as I was told, we are done with DoorDash. Deleted my app and don‚Äôt plan on using it ever again. You just stole 42$ from my daughter who ordered Chick-fil-A for her and her friends at a sleep over for her birthday. Congrats!!",1
doordash,719972451,2022-11-30 19:31:43,Company steals your money,"Zero stars should really be an option. This is a shady company who will steal your money and customer support is a travesty. Randomly started getting charged in October for a Dashpass when I have not used Doordash since May. The few times I used the app my orders were always missing items, which isn't necessarily the fault of the drivers. So whatever. My main issue is the random unauthorized charges. I go on the app and there's no indication of having an active account to cancel and if there was there isn't even an option to cancel. I go to the website and much the same. Finally I get on customer support. The first agent confirms I do not have an active account and asks me for a screenshot of the unauthorized charges. They wait less than a minute before closing the chat. At this point I'm beyond frustrated. Hop on chat again with a different agent and they assured me it's canceled and I will not be charged again. I asked for an email confirmation of the cancellation and refund. I'm still waiting to receive that if I ever do. We'll see about the refund. Don't use this app even once. They will start stealing your money.",1
doordash,719972451,2022-10-23 02:39:44,Dashers don‚Äôt follow instructions,"Here‚Äôs the deal! I use this app weekly and have been a monthly customer. But all that is changing as of today.

This whole app is based off of people doing their job. My dasher didn‚Äôt follow instructions. I got a message saying need substitutions. I entered them and minutes later it says order cancelled. The protocol is the dasher contacts you. Then they ask if you want a credit or a refund. I would have chosen credit bc I needed the cat food tonight and would have reordered. The dasher didn‚Äôt follow protocol a second time. 

So I had to reorder. When I did DoorDash informed me that refunds take 5-7 days to process. Basically, then you are out the $30 bucks a second time for 5-7 days. I talked to an agent, got transferred over 8 times. Then 1 hour and 20 minutes later they gave me a credit for my waste of time, since I said I was leaving their app and no longer going to be a weekly user. Therefore, I will use my $15 credit and cancel my monthly service. Meanwhile my bank makes interest on my $30 bucks for a week, and I am out gas money. There goes the ease of using an app. Go with Uber eats instead!",1
doordash,719972451,2022-10-24 23:28:59,They canceled my order,"Should be 0 stars.  I placed an order and didn‚Äôt receive my food.  Door Dash CS said they couldn‚Äôt credit my account since I used the restaurant app.  The restaurant told me the same so I was without my money and my lunch.  3 of their dashers were in the restaurant but the restaurant manager stated they told him the order was canceled so they wouldn‚Äôt take it.  My app showed 3 different dashers were on their way.  I spoke to DoorDash CS twice and requested a manager and was told one would call me, but if course no one called.  Both times I was put on hold only to be told my order was on the way.  When I told them no one was bringing the order they didn‚Äôt care to help or give a resolution for their mistake.  2 1/2 hours later the restaurant credited my account and still no call from DoorDash.  This was the second time I didn‚Äôt get my order from DoorDash and didn‚Äôt get help so I decided to write a review.  They are unorganized and the CS is worthless in giving any resolution to a serious issue‚Ä¶money out of my account and nothing to show for it, you‚Äôre just left with an ‚Äòoh well‚Äô attitude that their customers are ripped off.",1
doordash,719972451,2022-12-17 00:03:14,Service,"Service and times are mediocre, the tip is being billed before the service is complete, which equals a fact that we can‚Äôt tip accordingly, especially  to level of service received. This makes tipping a good faith thing. You don‚Äôt understand how many times I wished I could have lowered the tip because the delivery quality or time sucked. Which is totally the reason why I don‚Äôt use this or any service often anymore. So why pay for dash pass? That would not be fiscally unreasonable. 

DoorDash inc. isn‚Äôt as great as the big headed company thinks it is. It promotes customers to be lazy and wasteful. Over ordering is also too common. 

We all need to stop looking for easy buttons and paying a premium for lackluster service. I‚Äôd rather just take the family to the diner anymore, at least there I have a face to face level of service and workers are much more inclined to feel guilty when they neglect a paying customer.

I placed an order and had specific instructions to leave an ingredient out of my dish.  The restaurant added the ingredient anyway, which I understand can happen at times.  So I contacted DoorDash about the issue and the mistake on the store‚Äôs end.  The DoorDash agent told me I couldn‚Äôt get a full refund even though I was not at fault.  After frustratingly going back and forth as to why I couldn‚Äôt get a full refund for the stores mistake I agreed to get paid back to my card.  DoorDash issued me credits instead and after I contacted them about their mistake they said there was nothing they could do and I even had an agent disconnect on me mid chat.  I have screenshots and am tempted to take legal action, but I don‚Äôt want anything to do with the sorry excuse for a company.  I‚Äôve never had a problem with Grubhub and if there‚Äôs an issue they are more than willing to help you out with no issues on their end.

You guys did re deliver quickly, so I decided to move forward.
I then ordered late last night after work. After the first dasher dropped off, the second one Kayla was at the location.
I called her and heard the lady at the drive thru window confirming my order over the loud speaker. Then she hung up! So I‚Äôm assuming that she took the order for herself. After that hour or so ordeal. I then spend another 40 mins trying to get a resolution from CS.

Now, I have to pay even more and recently multiple orders have been bad or completely missing multiple items.

While I was fine with that, the order came in and it was missing half the items Including that 3 dollar drink.

DoorDash has quite an impressive ‚ÄúWhat went wrong?‚Äù response platform for their customers. But what good is it, whenever the app then states it‚Äôs refusal to issue a credit for any order error. My order was missing an item- quite a simple fix. I submitted my response, chose the item affected, gave a description and opted to give a photo. Got to the ‚Äúthanks for your response‚Äù page‚Äî which thanked me for my feedback, but stated that DoorDash doesn‚Äôt give refunds or even app-credit for any orders at this time.

doordash,719972451,2022-12-20 22:00:21,Always. Wrong.,"Wish I could give 0 stars. I have had basically every order wrong since using this platform. At the beginning, they give a credit. But it‚Äôs never actually even close to the original purchase amount. $3, here maybe $6 there. 

Then I had literally back to back orders wrong. And when I say wrong, I mean COMPLETELY missing items. Even one time, there was complete proof because the delivery driver messaged that the place was out of what I ordered. Door dash refused to ‚Äòcompensate‚Äô. I never asked for any extra just the money I had spent on items I didn‚Äôt ever get. I am furious that I have over $30 + wasted on items I never even got. 

When you contact support, the first message always seems like they will be so helpful but it‚Äôs downhill from there. They are rude, unhelpful, and sometimes just completely end the conversation by disconnecting. They always say they will follow up through email and then never do. I will never use doordash again. Never. At this point, it‚Äôs theft. They have stolen from me. Money that I work hard for. It‚Äôs ridiculous.",1
doordash,719972451,2022-10-08 19:52:28,Dasher issues,Unfortunately I was unable to continue using doordash because apparently when you have a dasher driver account AND  a personal doordash ordering app under the same email issues can arise. I decided to take the doordash ordering app off my phone because now I want to cook more. Due to me deactivating my personal doordash ordering app it ended up kicking me out of my dasher driver account. I called support and they confirmed that the issue was connecting one email to both accounts. Where it went wrong was when I was ASSURED that both accounts could be separated and that it would take 24/48 hrs.  I let over 48 hrs pass AFTER many log in attempts throughout the day. I called support again today and support then tells me that it is not possible to separate my accounts without reactivating the personal account & changing my email and I think thats unfair that I had to call & find that out. On top of the the support person I spoke also let m know that my request to separate my accounts was never possible so why assure me that it was? That did it for me.,1

They're all basically the same in my opinion, but the reason I prefer doordash over any other is because of the customer service. Sometimes issues happen with the food or the person delivering the food. That happens with every food delivery service. But the difference is that every time I've asked for customer service help from doordash, I'm always connected to a real person who is actually perfectly reasonable and extremely helpful about what they can do to make things right for me. Also, the ""help"" button is very easy to find. I've found that most other apps try to hide it from you and even when you do find it, you just end up talking to a robot then maybe getting a small refund.",5

I told him I simply can‚Äôt because I‚Äôm working. At the entrance there‚Äôs always workers that will receive the food for me. So instead he told me I‚Äôm wasting HIS time and just left it at a door on SOME MUD. When I finally had time to go the door he left it at I had to take the food out the bag but when I opened the bag my soup was spilled all over my food so I couldn‚Äôt even eat it anymore. Im glad I was able to get a some what refund but that would never make up the experience I just had I smell like the soup and covered in it and now I have to wait to get home to eat because I don‚Äôt ever want to order food on these apps again.

No way to leave support chat screen with the chat still open

‚ÄúNeed help with current order‚Äù just defaults to selecting a past order

App repeatedly asks and fails to verify my card.

Now for my experience with customer support. 

During my first attempt I was connected to someone Named Deepak, who clearly wasn‚Äôt paying attention to my problem, as his first 3 suggestions were all negated by my initial description of the problem. 

After accidentally leaving the chat with no way to return due to the aforementioned design flaws made by an idiot,

I attempted a second chat with customer support with someone named Megha. I assume Meghan didn‚Äôt fit, but then again Deepak fits, so who knows. 

Regardless they clearly weren‚Äôt paying attention either, because their first suggestion was that I ‚Äútry using the app instead of the desktop site‚Äù even though I clearly just said that my problem was in the app, and that the app ‚Äúwill only ask to scan the card for verification‚Äù when I specifically said that was the part that doesn‚Äôt work.

When a special ‚Äúdeal‚Äù is offered, and I meet the criteria for the deal, I am still not able to actually get the deal. And all the fees and prices have gone up so much, I often cancel out an order when I see the final total. This is true even with subscribing to the no delivery fee service. When the tip is figured, I don‚Äôt know what total they are basing it on. For a $24 order, the ‚Äú20% tip‚Äù was $6.50.

I would say maybe 1 in every 5 orders has either a missing or incorrect item‚Äîno big deal. These little mistakes happen all the time when you go to a restaurant.
However, apparently after a few orders with missing items, they stop refunding for the missing items‚Äîand support chat will just keep disconnecting you before you can figure out what‚Äôs going on. I don‚Äôt mind the little mistakes on orders, they‚Äôre most likely not DD‚Äôs fault. But SUPPORT trying to shrug me off so that they don‚Äôt have to tell me I‚Äôm not getting a refund for food I paid for but didn‚Äôt receive was infuriating. I think I went through 8 different representatives before we got to our conclusion. And for the record, I wasn‚Äôt swearing or harassing, nothing like that, just patiently trying to figure out what was going on.

Hey, I wish that my orders weren‚Äôt frequently missing items too. But cutting me off from being refunded for incorrect orders, without an option for appeal, or to provide pictures‚Äîanything‚Äîthat‚Äôs unacceptable. Like half my order wasn‚Äôt in the bag this time.
I‚Äôm not here to donate to DoorDash, I‚Äôm paying for a service. If that service isn‚Äôt provided, and I still have to pay, I‚Äôm deleting the app.

It‚Äôs too bad too, this was a nifty service. But bad policies like this are enough for me to just go drive around the block to get my own food.",1

We‚Äôve been fortunate enough to walk as far as 4 streets over just looking for our order and finding it, but even calling & messaging our Dasher to tell them per the app, you‚Äôre not even on our street is brutal as the Dashers ignore all communication efforts.

Now the majority of them are married to me in a polyamorous relationship and we all live in an estate together in the Canadian country. Our twelve children are all Dashers which is where we obtain our income (all those married to me are retired now). DoorDash changed my life for the better. DoorDash was there for me when my family wasn‚Äôt. Thank you DoorDash!",5
doordash,719972451,2022-12-14 01:21:20,No refund policy is ruining the app,"I‚Äôve been an avid DoorDash user for years. DoorDash in the past has always made it right for me when a restaurant has screwed up and I always provide proof of the screwup. These screwups by restaurants are unfortunately fairly frequent. Now tho, DoorDash is no longer providing refunds for anything it seems. Didn‚Äôt get your food? Too bad we have a no refund policy. Got the wrong order? Too bad no refunds? All wrong toppings on your burgers, bowls, etc? Too bad no refunds. I‚Äôve heard this same feedback from others and it‚Äôs making me seriously doubt that I‚Äôll renew my dash pass after my current year is up. I‚Äôve lost more money in the past month on non refunded screwups than I have saved with the fee waivers. If you don‚Äôt want to take responsibility for the restaurants on your platform don‚Äôt be surprised when you either lose customers or have people continuously making new accounts or finding some other way around this awful new policy. üëéüëéüëé",1

I compared an order from Uber eats from the same place and Door Dash was $7 more expensive (that‚Äôs dash pass versus no membership with Uber Eats). I can only imagine how much more expensive it would have been if I didn‚Äôt have dash pass (prob closer to $15 more). Honestly, I feel cheated ‚Äî additionally, even with dash pass you have to pay extra for ‚Äúexpress‚Äù delivery; meaning, they send the delivery driver off in a random direction in the wrong way before delivering to you if you don‚Äôt pay the feel. I have a screenshot of door dash trying to send the driver ~15 mins in the wrong direction when I was 3 mins away from the restaurant‚Ä¶ fortunately the driver called and told me he would bring me my food first.

Dear Customer Care Dining Professional,
Please, you have been most kind in handling my concerns of food quality and safety.  We have enjoyed a variety of foods that have satiated our palates.  However, unfortunately, there have been disappointing experiences (large and small) which have been resolved in an expeditious and professional way to our satisfaction.  I applaud you. I only hope you would consider having an ‚Äúundercover shopper‚Äù for restaurants that know the food does not match the advertised quality described.  That would hold them to the high standard that you have come to represent to me in your handling of the grievances.  
Thank you, again

The dasher took a picture of her car dashboard. I contacted customer service and I thought the issue was resolved when I said I just want another order place. I see where the order was placed, but Zaxby‚Äôs told the new dasher Steven that two orders was already made and gone mind you I ordered from Zaxby‚Äôs twice and the second one I never received. I contacted customer service again and was told they would give me $25 credit for the inconvenience but I would still receive the food. The dasher then called me and say I have to cancel my order so to make a long story short DoorDash only gave me $4 because even though the order was canceled due to their error they couldn‚Äôt give me my money back. I spend plenty of money with DoorDash look me up by my name but I promise I will not give another penny to this garbage company.",1
doordash,719972451,2022-12-04 13:33:13,THE ABSOLUTE WORST,"Okay this review is coming from a customer and a merchant point of view. As a customer I have been screwed over by doordash countless times; cold food, missing items, cancelled order an hour after I placed it, etc. everyone is short staffed (I manage a restaurant) so if you do not have drivers why are you allowing customers to place orders?? If a customer complains that the food is extremely cold or has a major piece missing why do you think $5 or less CREDIT is suffice?? As a merchant; if the first driver cancels after they have already picked it up, why not notify the restaurant so we can remake in a timely manner for the next driver, and the customer?? Also check the attitude of some of your drivers, you send them to the restaurant 10-15 minutes BEFORE the order is scheduled to be picked up and we receive nothing but attitude at the restaurant. All and all this company needs to reassess how they do business. I should not be upset as a customer and merchant.",1
doordash,719972451,2022-09-25 21:06:28,I got charged for a cancelled order without any reason,"I ordered from a restaurant last Friday when DoorDash app said delivery time is 57 mins. But after placing the order, delivery time changed to 80 mins which is too long. So within 2 mins, I called the restaurant to cancel the order, but they can‚Äôt do it via DoorDash. I so contacted DoorDash agent who helped me cancel the order and also confirmed that the order was cancelled. The restaurant also called me twice to confirm I don‚Äôt want this order and I want to cancel it.

But two hours later, DoorDash app said I was charged and the order was completed. I believe DoorDash still assigned a dasher to this order and when the dasher showed up in the restaurant, he/she asked the restaurant to prepare for this order. I contacted the second DoorDash agent. The agent confirmed with me that the first agent did help me cancel this order, but there are system errors. The agent escalated this issue to their escalation team.

I waited for more than 24 hours but all I got back from the escalation team is an email written in a standard template by a bot saying that the refund request is not approved by DoorDash‚Äôs policy.

I contacted DoorDash again. Their supervisor just repeated the same thing to me: your case has been reviewed by our escalation team and your refund request is not approved.

Super disappointed about DoorDash. They ask customers to pay for their own system errors.",1
doordash,719972451,2022-12-04 02:59:17,Horrible customer service,"This company is horrible. First, some of the drivers are bad. Just bad. There has been more than one occasion where I ordered food and the driver never delivered it and I called the company and they offered no refund. I called the restaurant but they said the dasher had picked up the food so they understandably couldn‚Äôt do anything. Other times the restaurant got my orders completely wrong. I specifically Star on all my orders if you are out of something or can‚Äôt make my order, don‚Äôt substitute, call me or at the very least cancel the order. The restaurant did neither and doordash didn‚Äôt give me a refund. They didn‚Äôt even give me credit. And because I have been very ill in 2022 I haven‚Äôt been able to leave home a lot this year so I depended on services like this a LOT. They treat they handicapped like crap.

One time I ordered alcohol and a driver left it on the street. In California. Which is against the law. I called Door Dash to complain. They didn‚Äôt care.",1

For a long time, this was great, but recently, 9 times out of 10 my order is missing something. Whether it be my drink, my sides, ingredients I wanted added or removed, or sometimes even whole entrees. 

And for the first month or so, door dash was good about refunding missing items. Something changed though, and now when a $9 item is missing, they only offer a $2 DOOR DASH CREDIT, and recently, they can‚Äôt even give me that. The last time I used them, all of my family‚Äôs sides were missing, probably costing close to $20 and they offered zero compensation. I‚Äôm losing money AND I don‚Äôt get what I ordered. And whether it‚Äôs the store‚Äôs fault or the dasher‚Äôs fault, I still pay for things I don‚Äôt receive. It‚Äôs frustrating and a waste of money.

doordash,719972451,2022-12-12 21:15:59,Crazy high markups,"I used DoorDash once and took advantage of ‚Äúfree delivery‚Äù for your first order, because of their new partnership with Chick-fil-a. I ended up with a $5 credit because my order was an hour late, completely wrong and very cold. In trying to use up my credit, I noticed that prices were higher normal. I opened up my Postmates account and noticed that every single item I viewed from multiple restaurants was $1-$3 higher, with a higher delivery fee. In fact, the price of the food was more than if I ordered directly from the restaurant. What a disaster, I haven‚Äôt used my $5 credit and am tempted to treat it as a loss.

They have the delivery notifications with their ad notifications. Meaning you either receive delivery notifications and updates or you don‚Äôt to avoid the STUPID ads. We‚Äôre already using the app . Back off!",3
doordash,719972451,2022-12-06 20:30:28,Downfall,"Honestly I‚Äôve spent thousands of dollars over several years with this company and they can never get anything right. It now takes HOURS for my food to arrive when it used to be fairly reliable and reasonable just about a year ago. Now you have to PAY EXTRA on top of paying a dash pass fee to get your food ‚Äúfaster.‚Äù That‚Äôs the whole point of a dash pass? Never had to pay that until recently. 
I‚Äôve ordered an hour ahead so it can get here on time when I‚Äôm taking lunch at work and it still takes them 2 hours to get a dasher to bring my food. Maybe DoorDash should pay their drivers more and have less restrictions on who can dash because I tried to dash myself for over two years and they never accept me. Take care of your dashers and maybe you‚Äôll be able to retain the good ones. Do better DoorDash. I‚Äôm cancelling my dash pass with you and using another platform now. You lost yet another loyal customer and their business!",1
doordash,719972451,2022-11-02 00:21:11,Delivery,"I love using Door Dash, especially when your driver comes directly to your house. The time is as stated and the food is hot.  However, when the driver is stopping to drop off other orders, not always from the same place, my order is usually the second delivery. We have had drivers drop off the other order to our house. They cannot go back and exchange the order for health reasons. An hour and a half went by and we were refunded for the meal. No food! The delivery takes much more time when they go somewhere else and the food is often cold. One time I checked to see where the driver was on the road. The restaurant was fairly close to our home but his route took him in the opposite direction. I would be willing to give bigger tips if I knew I was the priority.",4

Customer service is absolutely terrible, they should not even be called customer service because they do absolutely nothing to help!!! I work in a location that doesn‚Äôt allow cars on the street, so I always make sure to specify which business it is and where it is when ordering food. It‚Äôs not a problem most of the time, and sometimes the dashers will message or call me if they need help. This time the dasher left my food at another location on the street that was unclear. I therefore didn‚Äôt get my food cause I couldn‚Äôt find it! I contacted support and they emailed me a pic of my food left outside of a closed building in the rain! Then said they can‚Äôt help me the policy won‚Äôt let them. Unacceptable. I will be deleting this app. Don‚Äôt waste your hard earned money here. The worst part is I even left the imbecile a tip!",1

I only had an issue here or there and always opted for credits instead of asking for my money back and they handled it really well the couple times something did happen. I spent SO much money ordering from door dash minimum 2-5 times a week every single week. 

The last month or two I have had an issue with almost every single order I‚Äôve made. It started literally taking 2 hours for my food to get to my house and 3 times, the app was showing that my dasher was close by for 2 hours but after I contacted support I found out the dasher never picked up my order and since it was so late at night, I couldn‚Äôt order anything else and they wouldn‚Äôt give me a refund. I‚Äôve had at least 5 issues just like that since then and they handled it so poorly. For as much money as I spent with them, I‚Äôm so disappointed with how they decide to repay loyalty.",1

I waited 45 min for an order that was supposedly taken to the wrong address. Dasher did not follow the instructions to text when arrive, it seems she wanted to keep the food. I spoke to her over the phone 1x and she still supposedly ended up at the wrong address again and left my food there. Now I have to wait another 45 mins. For a redelivery, I will not be using this app again. Oh and when I called customer service the rep could barely speak English and was speaking some words in Chinese. Will only order from a browser from now on too many problems using this app!

doordash,719972451,2022-11-26 00:02:05,Terrible Service that WILL NOT Refund You,"This app is awful. They overcharge on their food and often get orders wrong and offer no recourse or refund. If a $15 item isn‚Äôt what you ordered, you‚Äôll receive $3.50 as a refund, if they even agree to that. If you try to report an issue and the app crashes, they claim it is ‚Äúresolved‚Äù and won‚Äôt refund you. If you call to report a problem with an order, you‚Äôll be put on a long hold and speak with someone who has little power to provide refunds and makes no effort to even understand what you‚Äôre reporting. If an order doesn‚Äôt arrive, they‚Äôll claim a 24 hr team is looking into it, report the issue was resolved, and will not refund you. Essentially, when they mess up, and they will, and often, they don‚Äôt even try to do right by the customer.

I was a loyal customer for over a year and finally got fed up. DD is awful to customers, they‚Äôre awful to drivers, and they‚Äôre awful in general.",1

Doordash I‚Äôm talking to you, CHECK who you let drive for you. I use this app when I can‚Äôt get food in the house and when I receive the wrong order or missing items because YOU hired incompetent people that happen to have a license, it makes you look bad. The only thing consistent about your services is the fact your drivers are NEVER consistent or correct. They deliver items to wrong addresses, steal food, flat out don‚Äôt deliver, or can‚Äôt seem to tell he difference between one order and another.

The company isn‚Äôt customer service forward, ok. It‚Äôs about getting cash quickly and dusting your hands of actually having to be involved with dealing with minor issues. 
If you plan to have a company, be prepared to deal with people and serve them if they pay for your expensive fees.

I am extremely upset since I‚Äôm a high ordering customer - I order almost every 2 days and I rarely report issues, the last issue I reported that resulted in a refund was in Sept 2022.

The mix ups have been increasing to where more orders are wrong than those that are right. Order times are going from 30 minutes to 60-90 minutes because they‚Äôre combining orders every time. The final straw is that the last two orders were someone else‚Äôs order. Wrong restaurant, wrong items. One time it was someone‚Äôs $120 multiple item UberEats order that contained mostly seafood dishes that we did not want to eat.

For stores that have long menus, it‚Äôs so frustrating to endlessly be scrolling up and down AND if the item is out of stock, rather than DoorDash just marking it as out of stock, it disappears from the menu-so you just end up scrolling more. Honestly, this seems like a design choice they made to get people to ‚Äúdiscover‚Äù more items to add to cart. 

Finally, the compensation they offer unless you select the ‚Äòitem is missing‚Äô when an item delivered is incorrect will be such a small percentage of the item that it in no way covers a replacement or even your time if you need to reorder for allergy/preferences.",3

Not only do they charge an absurd handling fee on top of the delivery fee, but they increase the price of everything on restaurants menus. The normal price of a burger from your favorite restaurant becomes even more expensive when using the app. The restaurant receipt was stapled to my last order and it came to a total of 54$, the DoorDash cost for the food alone was nearly 75$ before they added the handling fee, delivery fee, taxes and tip. The 54$ meal it would have cost to pick up became nearly 100$ meal. I always thought it was the restaurants who were upping their prices during Covid, but it turns out it was just DoorDash marking everything up.

Other times if I remember to order before seven, I got it okay and everting was good. It is convenient to use them because I am wheelchair bound and can‚Äôt drive . It gets frustrating not getting what you ordered but you just have to take the bad with the good. They don‚Äôt have much control over how good their drivers are.

doordash,719972451,2022-11-20 00:46:10,Poor service utilizing questionable ‚Äúcontractors‚Äù,"First off, $42 for 2 sandwiches. Not fancy sandwiches, we‚Äôre talking run of the mill sandwich shop on the corner sandwiches. That‚Äôs not counting a tip or the delivery fee. The sandwiches at the store don‚Äôt even cost half this amount. In fact, for this amount I could get 2 more sandwiches or at least 4 sides. This is literally price gouging and should be removed from the Apple Store.

Keep in mind that your delivery person through DoorDash is an ‚Äúindependent contractor‚Äù. What this means is limited background information, questionable ethics, minimal control over individual delivery persons on DoorDash‚Äôs end, and of course DoorDash enjoys limited liability because their delivery contractors are not employees of DoorDash. Sketchy practices at best. Fake reviews on the App Store should be a big red flag, but big tech allows it. Really wish COVID hadn‚Äôt given them such a boom in business. Companies with shady practices like this deserve to drown.",1

The app crashed I check my email and it says you have been refunded and your account has been deactivated. Contacted customer service and was rerouted to 4 people before I could get my account activated. Waste my time. After 30 minutes reactivated account. I went to renew dash pass and same thing happens again. So annoyed decided to deal with it the next day. Contacted customer service and same process happens. Did it a fourth time, no agent. Fifth time, agent does not listen and continues process and tells me your account will be reactivated check email. 24 hours later no email. Horrible customer service doesn‚Äôt listen and can‚Äôt resolve same issue, over 10 agents and still same issue. Will be using Grubhub from now on. I would recommend anyone wanting to try DoorDash to not waste your time.",1
doordash,719972451,2022-11-17 03:09:15,Joke of a company,Absolute ridiculous joke of a company. I‚Äôm going to tell everyone I know to never to use this shame. I order my first order as a gift to my family on vacation in florida which was all booze. I had to upload an ID and sign off on verification of age when deliver was made. Driver took a picture of their dash and said it was delivered and took off. I escalated this to the first round of customer service and was told I had a valid case and they would escalate it further. Next morning I received a notice from their customer service that I had never ordered before and therefore didn‚Äôt qualify for a refund. Escalated again and was told basically too bad. DON‚ÄôT EVER USE THIS CLOWN OF A SITE!! I will tell everyone and anyone I talk to the same thing! First order ever I make with them gets stolen and their response is ‚Äútoo bad you have never ordered with us so we can‚Äôt help you‚Äù. Absolutely joke!,1
doordash,719972451,2022-10-21 04:41:49,DashPash Causes Order Problems,"I don‚Äôt know how this happens but if I just don‚Äôt pay for dashpass, service is entirely hit or miss.  Maybe you‚Äôll get a good driver. Maybe you‚Äôll get the right order.  Maybe if you pay enough in tip your food is actually hot.  (Drivers typically want 50% of the subtotal regardless of distance or size of order)

But if you pay for dashpass everything changes.  Every driver takes multiple orders and yours is last regardless of what you tip.  On top of that, more times than not, you‚Äôll get the wrong order or missing items.  Or your driver will spill your drinks and blame the drink carrier.

And what does support do?  DoorDash Credits.  They might tell you they‚Äôll refund your payment method.  But you‚Äôll still only get credits back, only useable on DoorDash.  

So if they mess up enough the only way to get your money back is to order again.  And it‚Äôs going to get just as messed up.  

Besides all of this the prices are entirely wrong for everything.  For every single available item you pay an up charge on the initial price.  Compare any in store price to DoorDash and it‚Äôs impossible to miss the upcharge on the subtotal.  Add taxes and fees.  Monitor taxes and fees.  Even the monthly $9 DashPass fee doesn‚Äôt change much of anything from the end user cost per order all considered.",1
doordash,719972451,2022-10-10 16:24:48,Support is awful,"I‚Äôve ordered a few times from DoorDash and honestly support is impossible. Usually if I have to get something from a store, they don‚Äôt even list the right available items. I have to go through support and try to change the substitutions they allow to get what the driver says is available. Honestly at this point it‚Äôs less of a headache to get it myself!!! Not to mention support takes forever and usually just cancels the order when this happens so I get nothing. Not to mention I was promised credits as part of a refund when this last happened, they were never delivered, and when I asked support about it again they said they basically had no clue what I was talking about!!! It didn‚Äôt use to be this bad, the app was great for getting supplies when I had Covid, but it really went downhill!üò°üò°üò°",2

Fast forward to today, I‚Äôm having pain and discomfort so I order what I needed from cvs and it‚Äôs delivered to the wrong place.  I text‚Äôd contact support and showed them the picture the dasher send of the mat and door they delivered to. I also sent a picture of my mat to prove they delivered to the wrong place. They told me my case was under review and someone would make contact with me in 24 hours. I ordered medicine for pain to be delivered so I wouldn‚Äôt have to go get it myself. It was the dashers mistake but they refused to just resend my order. Three issues within two days, that‚Äôs too frequent. I‚Äôm deleting the app and choosing another option. This is ridiculous.",1
doordash,719972451,2022-11-08 05:50:58,The only problem,"The only problem with doordash is sometime they will have stores showing it‚Äôs available but they might be closed, then if your order it canceled you can get credit but if you get a refund back to your card it‚Äôs gonna take a whole week and most time you can‚Äôt pick if you want credit or your money back, and some of the dashers will steal your food so be careful and use Uber eats it‚Äôs the complete opposite of doordash. If your order get cancale your get your money back right then and there you don‚Äôt have to wait and they show you that the store is open or close and the right days and time they open",5

I don‚Äôt know how many times this service has left me hanging in Salt Lake waiting for food that‚Äôs cold, missing items or just doesn‚Äôt show up at all. Usually it‚Äôs a super long extended wait past the estimated time plus one of those other problems. They offer a fraction of compensation of what missing items cost. Even when a whole meal is missing from delivery or wrong they will try to give you a base refund taking 5-7 business days while you‚Äôre out of luck on feeding your family and everything else is closing. Most of it is the garbage quality of delivery drivers probably due to garbage pay despite the fact door dash emphasizes tips for better service. This is garbage I wish I had every penny back I‚Äôve spent that DD made at this point. 
I‚Äôm probably 30 bad delivery‚Äôs deep and fully deleting this garbage.",1
doordash,719972451,2022-10-05 23:38:52,Worst Company,"Their dasher hit my car, the dasher‚Äôs insurance doesn‚Äôt cover me because they don‚Äôt cover rider services, and DoorDash denied me even after further investigation determined their dasher was found to be at fault. It‚Äôs been over a month and have not gotten any further word from DoorDash after numerous attempts to get an update or answer on my claim. Just a warning to current and future users of DoorDash, there is a huge loop hole that allows drivers with subpar coverage to drive for DoorDash and in the event of something like this happening, the customer or bystander is left dry to pay for damages that were completely the fault of the DoorDasher and DoorDash entirely when they refuse to do the right thing. You‚Äôre better off picking up your own food if you‚Äôre just going to be held accountable in the event of damages occurring regardless of who‚Äôs at fault. Very disappointed in DoorDash. I will be canceling my subscription.",1
doordash,719972451,2022-11-20 22:31:43,"Overall nice, but wish tip offering is AFTER","I enjoy having the option of food being delivered to me. Especially when I work at a place where I cannot leave the campus, such as the hospital. Or when I live alone and sick, I can have someone deliver takeout, groceries, or even some medications for me. However, I only wish that the option for tipping the dasher pops up once the delivery is made, similar to UberEats. How can I properly tip them prior? Is that supposed to be motivation for the dasher to earn money? I don‚Äôt tip much anymore because when I do, my dasher doesn‚Äôt deliver well and becomes too complicated and doesn‚Äôt work out well. So I would like the option to tip after delivery has been completed if that is something that could be changed. Thank you.",3

I had a delivery driver who called cussing me out because they had to park ACROSS THE STREET instead of out front. Then when I opened the door and they were walking away, in front of my toddler they started CUSSING ME OUT! It was f you mf! And a bunch of other stuff, my baby was scared and started crying then my husband came out and all of a sudden this make delivery driver changed his tone. He got really nervous and afraid and tried to play victim. When I called customer service to report the incident they said the best they could do was refund me the $3 delivery fee. I miss the days when customer service mattered. I don‚Äôt expect people to take being treated like less than from anyone, but that should also mean you can‚Äôt treat customers like this with no repercussions.",1
doordash,719972451,2022-11-01 20:07:33,Annoying filter issue,"DoorDash is certainly convenient sometimes, but the app can be somewhat frustrating. It‚Äôs possible that some of the problems are because of the way restaurants enter information‚ÄîI have no idea how it works on that end‚Äîso I‚Äôll stick with my biggest gripe: when I use the filters on the home page of the app and then spend a few seconds too long looking at a restaurant page (less than a minute is apparently too long, the filters have been reset when I come back. And then I have to set them again and start the whole process over. Extremely obnoxious. I know I‚Äôm not the only person who needs to browse, so how about keeping the filters until a person resets them or until they order?",3
doordash,719972451,2022-12-04 18:55:17,Changing location and poor customer service,I order the same order at the same location consistently for pickup. Twice now DoorDash has updated the location to somewhere 20 minutes away!! The first time the manager was understanding and made my order at their location but I had to wait about 20 minutes. This time the manager was extremely rude and said drive to the other location. I called customer service to just get a refund and they put me on a 20 minute hold just to of canceled the order on their end and not even give me a refund! The customer service assistant even told me to just drive and go ask anyways. What kind of buggy app and sub par customer service is this? This was my final straw with all the terrible experiences I‚Äôve had so far. No more door dash- deleting my account and app. Try Uber eats or something more reliable instead.,1
doordash,719972451,2022-11-15 19:04:50,Delicious food!,My first experience with this restaurant is the best first experience I‚Äôve ever had with a restaurant. They far exceeded my expectations. I tried a bunch of different dishes and they were all amazing. I ordered the Mac and cheese but they were out of it so they substituted the Rasta pasta. So happy with the substitution!  The lunch special curry chicken was flavorful and had the perfect amount of heat. The steamed vegetables were tasty and not overlooked like in so many other places. The rice was perfectly cooked and was a great compliment to the chicken. The jerk chicken empanadas we‚Äôre out of this world!  And the sweet plantains were the perfect end to the meal. Pretty sure I‚Äôm going to order dinner from them tonight.,5
doordash,719972451,2022-09-20 16:36:36,THIEVES,They have no form of properly qualifying they‚Äôre drivers as there‚Äôs many that sign up and steal your food by not delivering it. Then when you try to get a refund DoorDash declines that request. I had a guy take a picture of the road not even getting off his car just opening the door while my order is clearly in his hands and driving off with the food all caught on my Ring Security Camera. Do not order from here even the regular drivers constantly forget to get your whole order or properly ask for the items. Many times I‚Äôve had to deal with wrong orders and missing items. They are terrible!,5
doordash,719972451,2022-09-27 02:35:34,DOORDASH PROCESSING STEALS UR MONEY,"if I could give zero stars I would. Using another card on an account can result in the cardholder being charged for dashpass for months, even after the account owner removes the card and cancels DoorDash on their account. This means that multiple people can be paying for a dashpass that DOES NOT EXIST. That‚Äôs not all! sometimes they will charge you once, sometimes TWICE a month for the same dashpass. What does this mean? Well multiple members of my family have been both paying for my sister‚Äôs dash pass. We are talking about being charged $20, $30, $40 a month for a service NOT PROVIDED. This level of negligence is embarrassing at best and fraud at worst. didn‚Äôt sign up for DoorDash at all? Don‚Äôt worry, they will still find a way to steal your money!  Plenty online have mentioned being charged for a pass despite never signing up for a trial in the first place!",1
doordash,719972451,2022-10-13 00:40:11,Literally a scam at this point,"My account has been deactivated for no reason twice in the last 3 months and then a few days ago i had ordered food and didn‚Äôt receive part of my order. i contacted support in order to either get my food or a refund for the stuff i never got. the lady on support told me there was nothing she could do and refused to let me speak to a supervisor or superior (which i wasn‚Äôt going to do to get her in trouble, i know some things they don‚Äôt have the power to override). i hung up and called back because i wasn‚Äôt taking the unnecessary rudeness anymore and the next person told me they could issue me a credit which i was fine with.

I‚Äôm upset because I paid 17$ and couldn‚Äôt even receive credit but completely am going to bed hungry! I haven‚Äôt received my order and the dasher did not deliver it to the right address because it says she left it but I had not seen a SINGLE BAG FOR MY FOOD AND IM VERY UPSET I even feel hatred for DoorDash because of how often they‚Äôve done nothing but completely messed up all my orders!

doordash,719972451,2022-09-19 00:53:56,Deceptive advertising,"I rarely post reviews but felt like I shouldn‚Äôt let these issues sit as they could impact others not paying attention. We will be deleting this app after tonight‚Äôs experience. 

1. Doordash provided me a promo to entice me to place an order. At checkout they declined to honor that promo. There were no explanations. 
2. Doordash advertised no delivery fee initially for the restaurant I was ordering from, however, at checkout it somehow added a deliver fee. Was that a bug? I‚Äôm not sure. But given the other issues my guess is it‚Äôs a feature and they‚Äôre advertising of fee is wonky at best. 
3. Even if there was no ‚Äúdelivery‚Äù fee there was a 15% ‚Äúservice fee‚Äù which is not for the dasher. they mix that additional fee into the taxes section of the bill. Let‚Äôs face it Doordash, that‚Äôs a delivery fee through the eyes of the consumer trying to figure out how much it will cost to order delivery. 
4. They promote a monthly pass and that you can sign up for a trial to fees waived. However, when I went to sign up for that the app again had another ‚Äúerror‚Äù and wouldn‚Äôt apply. 

All in all, my order would have been 25-30% more expensive than just picking up. For some that may be worth it. But even for those that it is, I‚Äôm sure they‚Äôd like transparency.",1
doordash,719972451,2022-09-24 23:25:51,I didn‚Äôt have any problems,"Wowza! I hadn‚Äôt read any of the reviews before I placed my order.

My delivery driver was kind and patient with trying to locate my place (he actually tried calling but I didn‚Äôt realize that I had my phone on silent and I was out in my garden awaiting my order/watering plants). Thankfully I looked at my phone and saw that he had messaged me asking for more specific directions to my home. Within a couple minutes of messaging him back, BAM! My order was here! Yay! First time Doordash user, definitely will be a repeat customer. Thanks!! :-)",5
doordash,719972451,2022-11-09 01:00:56,Isometimes I get shortchanged,"I am a dash pass member. I frequently order groceries from a local retailer. Whenever they do not have an item, a refund is processed for the item. So if I order 25 things and 5 are not available they have to refund me for 5.  Well in the system it looks like I am always requesting refunds, which I am not. So if I order from a restaurant and do not receive all of my items I am unable to get refunded because the computer looks at all refunds the same. So in a sense it is not worth it to get the Dash pass because if I am missing items they refuse to refund me my money from fast food restaurants. It is very frustrating.

The driver was Patrice and I watched the apt of her entering my subdivision.  I then looked at my surveillance cameras and observed a gold color car stopped in front of my house.  I then received a notice that my food was delivered and a photo of the food in a bag. It look like it was in her vehicle when she took the photo.  She never exited the car and drove off without me receiving the food.  I called DoorDash and the said I will not receive a refund because I had a duplicate in January.

doordash,719972451,2022-12-02 10:35:20,They Literally Steal Your Money,"I started DoorDash a couple months ago. Out of the 12 orders I made, 3 were incorrect. Each time they told me I would ‚Äúget a full refund‚Äù because they are ‚Äúso sorry this happened.‚Äù

This most recent time I didn‚Äôt even get my order. I talked to DoorDash. They told me they weren‚Äôt refunding me, then ended their chat. I entered chat again and they immediately ended it. I entered the help chat again. Same thing. I entered it again, and the person told me there was a glitch and I was charged incorrectly. Then said they wouldn‚Äôt deliver the food or refund me. Then ended chat. A ‚Äúmanager‚Äù sent me an email apologizing and then, said they wouldn‚Äôt refund me. 
So I decided to look at my refund history. They didn‚Äôt refund anything.

I‚Äôm down quite a bit of money from lies.

Don‚Äôt use this app. They literally steal your money and their customer service is horrible.

They asked me to wait 24 hours to ‚Äúresearch and get back to me‚Äù and after 24 hours never once reached out. Now the app says my issue was resolved and I can‚Äôt open a ticket again.

Have to go to go to my credit card company and hopefully I can get refunded back what they stole.

Today, if I order say a pizza and a couple sodas but they don‚Äôt bring the soda.  They will credit your account instead of bringing you what you paid for already.  This way you have to order again and pay the delivery fees and whatever other bloated charge they want to add on.  Sure you could credit back to the original payment method but that doesn‚Äôt change the fact that you didn‚Äôt get what you paid for or that you have to pay extra again to get it.

Not happening. My food could usually cost 10$ and i‚Äôll be paying 20$ just for the food before the delivery prices and taxes come in. It can say it‚Äôs an 8 minute pick up but 50 minute delivery when the store is down the street.. I‚Äôm sorry but this app is really unacceptable looking at it from someone who usually does it themselves. It‚Äôs a scam and you guys are getting a lot of money out of this and still want me to pay a tip to the dasher. I‚Äôm sorry but you guys can pay the tip if my order is 10$ more then what it usually will be. (not including delivery, taxes, or tip)",1

No coupons, no discount, just a chance to give them their money back all over again. So now, 80+min for my order as I try again. This is why I‚Äôve never used DoorDash and lesson learned, I‚Äôll never use it again after today.

Not to mention, the pop was for kids‚Ä¶ by the time they get here they‚Äôll get put in the fridge for tomorrow because it‚Äôll be their bedtime. So now I have to deal with disappointed kids. Thanks.",1
doordash,719972451,2022-10-07 23:29:17,Some suggestions for better dasher-customer communication,"I use DD all of the time, and I‚Äôm even a dasher myself. Though, I feel like there could be some ways the communication between the dasher and their customer(s) can be better.

‚Ä¢ a way to see how busy an area is when ordering to get a rough gauge of how long the delivery may take.
‚Ä¢ a pop up of sorts, that would encourage a customer to tip more if an area or specific restaurant has long wait times, like for Taco Bell at night time. 
‚Ä¢ the ability to let us choose a cash tip option. Sometimes it‚Äôs much easier to tip cash, but since it‚Äôs a dying currency, I can understand why it‚Äôs not an option.",4
doordash,719972451,2022-11-20 16:55:04,Dear door dash,"Costumer service really trash and they will send you into very dangerous places and they wouldn‚Äôt care  because all about there business not your life even low pay rate when you gotta do more miles then the pay and even in drop off you going to have trouble in the maps never a correct address etc. they even deactivate you if you don‚Äôt accept them low balling when they know gas ain‚Äôt cheap so really it‚Äôs not up to you it‚Äôs up the them when you should accept or not. 
This is a horrible company to work for take it as that and keep it moving",5
doordash,719972451,2022-10-25 19:46:03,Using the new ‚ÄúDoubleDash‚Äù dual order same driver never works,"Placing an order using ‚ÄúDoubleDash‚Äù to pick up a 2nd order from a nearby place using the same driver to save yourself a delivery fee never works. The system always drops or never submits the 2nd order and then cistern service tells you to just place another order and pay all of the delivery fees and tips for a separate order that will arrive in another 45-90 minutes. Meanwhile the system calculates a Dasher tip based on the double/combined orders, and then when only 1 order arrives, DoorDash refuses to recalculate or refund the double tip amount. 
They chose to permanently lose me as a long-time customer rather than to just simply acknowledge there was some technical issues going on. I closed my account permanently, and all my delivery orders will be through Uber now. 
Sad. 
Goodbye DoorDash",1
doordash,719972451,2022-10-21 02:21:32,Misleading and,"When the delivery fees are posted, they should be charged as such. It blows my mind DoorDash gets away with adding additional delivery fees in a section called ‚Äútaxes and fees.‚Äù They should probably categorize the taxes separately so we know we‚Äôre not paying tax on any intangible items like their fees on fees. Then they have the audacity to recommend we give like a 35% tip!? We tip on the total of items purchased. Not including the delivery fees and whatever other fees they try to hide. A 20% tip on my $30 purchase (which was $40 after their ‚Äú2.99‚Äù delivery fee) would be $6. And that used to be considered generous. Yet I have to hit ‚Äúother amount‚Äù and type in my generous tip as if I was doing something wrong. I‚Äôll delete the app and use others from now on. Hope the creators are spending their billions wisely. Like not ordering from DoorDash.",1
doordash,719972451,2022-09-29 15:20:20,Love DD & DashPass,"I use DoorDash all the time it started while @ work when I would have a short lunch breaks but now I use it sometimes @ home too! If you use DD @ least twice a month or more you should get DashPass  IT‚ÄôS DEFINITELY WORTH IT! Pay annually to save even more money on fees, deliveries & DashPass dues. I‚Äôm on a first name basis with most of my local dashers lol but I must admit Ivan is the best he‚Äôs a Rockstar! DD is always convenient & prompt. I‚Äôve been using it for yrs & I‚Äôve only had one issue & I use it 3 or 4 times a week sometimes. I love how it‚Äôs designed to give you real time updates & info about your order & dasher. Thank you DD!",5
doordash,719972451,2022-12-18 18:53:46,Love door dash but annoyed with the drivers,"Idk if it‚Äôs the drivers or the restaurants but my last three orders I haven‚Äôt gotten my drinks. Idk if it‚Äôs just a weird glitch , I get my DoorDash credits but I was throughly annoyed this last time. I‚Äôm sick today and I ordered a protein smoothie and a side flat bread only got my flat bread and the smoothie was the most expensive part . Then I gotta use my credits pay more money again on top of the credits to get it redelivered.  They should have an option for redleievry for missing items because then the person ordering has to pay another 5/6 dollars on top of the ‚Äúcredits‚Äù for the missing item that you already paid to have delivered in the first place? Makes no sense.",3
doordash,719972451,2022-12-03 14:40:19,Good but there is a huge problem,"So I have been using door dash for years and generally, everything is really good. But I wanted to warn people DO NOT USE EXPRESS for your order. I don't know if this is with everyone but I stay in an apartment and every time I tried to use express delivery they get lost. And every time they call me and I have to come downstairs to meet them to get my food. I never have any problems with standard delivery. They find the place every time. Could be just people starting out or something for the express delivery? I don‚Äôt know. Just stick to regular delivery for stuff. Other than that. It‚Äôs a good app and I get my food on time.",4
doordash,719972451,2022-11-08 23:55:29,Love the ordering function but delivery is problematic,"I use DoorDash and lot, and I have used it for almost 3 years. We have rarely had issues that were not the restaurant‚Äôs fault. However, in the last few months, the map function that the app uses has been sending the dashers to the completely wrong street. For years this was not an issue. All of a sudden, every time we order the dasher ends up calling us to say they can‚Äôt find our house, and it it can sometimes be a huge hassle to get the dasher to the house. Doordash, please update your maps. This house has been here since 1976, so it‚Äôs definitely you and not me.",4
doordash,719972451,2022-10-19 13:01:25,Glossing over honesty,"Let me start with the good: Convenient, reliable (mostly), and fair in comparison to other apps The not so good: Dashers often are late, there‚Äôs little accountability other than a refund (more on this) if something is missing or wrong, store menus are not always updated or right. The UGLY: Reviews are kicked back unless they are 4-5üåü. Huge issue with that, it‚Äôs fraud! If there‚Äôs a review for a place submitted with less than 3 stars, it‚Äôs kicked back and not submitted, even if it‚Äôs not going against the posted guidelines for a review. This means establishments are not held accountable except for a refund through the application and more people will endure the same poor results. I‚Äôm available for verification if needed.",3
doordash,719972451,2022-09-11 18:45:10,Nice offers brought me back,"I have had many issues with missing food and incorrect orders from various delivery services. Some is fault of restaurant, example giving driver wrong order,missing items. Some is fault of drivers who for whatever reason don‚Äôt arrive ,cancel or drop at wrong address and some the APP, example Outback Steakhouse twice now the order defaults to two salads when order sweet potato‚Äôs with meals. The discount now offered brought me back,unfortunate first order wrong and so bad no one would eat it,restaurant fault. Second was Outback,missing food app issue and third is pending, certainly they won‚Äôt mess up bagels and coffee. Fingers crossed.",4
doordash,719972451,2022-12-20 04:29:15,I shouldn‚Äôt love anything this much,"But I do. I love the ease of ordering food to be delivered, and the random promotions that are included with some new restaurants that have been added. Having Apple Pay as an option to pay is great as well - I don‚Äôt keep a card on file but I do have Apple Pay. Finally, the addition of grocery stores to Doordash has been amazing as well. Sometimes I just don‚Äôt want to go to the store and this may sound crazy to those who live in the suburb, but I don‚Äôt want to lose my parking spot. Street parking in the Bay Area may be a large reason doordash thrives.",5
doordash,719972451,2022-12-13 19:40:55,Double Dash,Just disappointed I was not reimbursed for when my Thai food order of triple vegetable with beef was not reimbursed like customer support said they would.  We had a three way conversation with the driver myself and customer support who heard the driver say he never did pick up my Thai food order.  Customer support said wait 25 minutes and you should see the refund.  I thought it was safe to reorder and thought I‚Äôd get a fresh remake of what I ordered.  Two hours later when I reordered I got delivered my original order and never reimbursed.  I got charged twice for 2 hour old food.,5
doordash,719972451,2022-12-08 19:13:22,Terrible customer service,"Wooow I have been a loyal customer for a long time and I use this service daily. But their customer service has gone downhill recently and I have had it with them. Imagine spending $70+ of your hard earned money on an order to find feathers in your food!!! I threw it all away and asked for compensation since the food was not edible, I was bounced around different sketchy teams of customer support that flat out told me due to the history of your account we cannot compensate you. Keep in mind for the past 100+ orders i have not requested any compensation to make matters worse everytime i try to finish writing this review it starts deleting itself, Worst customer service ever save your money as they will steal it and go with any other app that offers similar services. This one is not worth it",1
doordash,719972451,2022-10-26 21:57:40,POOR SERVICE,Every single time I order anything through this app there is an issue or inconvenience. The ONLY reason I‚Äôm still using this app is because my money is tied up in credits that has to be used before I am able to delete this entire app. These drivers are poor sorry excuse for working citizens. They are very lazy and most are too illiterate to follow simple directions such as HAND IT TO ME! Dashers will pick up the call but not the order. I‚Äôve had dashers literally sitting in the parking lot high off drugs while I‚Äôm waiting on my order to be delivered. Called the merchant only for them to say they have completed my order 45 minutes ago. Gets up and go to the place and the dasher is over dosing in the parking lot from some type of drug with my food in the car. These people hire anybody but refused to hire me. Tuh!,1
doordash,719972451,2022-10-20 19:58:18,Laggy and buggy,"Grocery stores are bugged. I can only order from food places with small menus but with places that have a large menu/more items to load the app crashes and gets stuck on the loading animation and eventually freezes(animation and no touch control) Restarting, redownloading, different devices(I‚Äôve tried 3 apple devices) or different profiles do not fix this issue. As an app developer I know these things can happen and hope this review gets seen and fixed because this error makes me use Uber eats instead when I originally just use door dash, y‚Äôall are losing my service so please fix this! I‚Äôm sure it‚Äôs not just me as my gf has the same issue and she completely deleted the app and exclusively uses Uber eats now",2
doordash,719972451,2022-09-24 21:36:16,Very reoccurring customer,"Time and time again I order something from my town, and time and time again I don‚Äôt receive my full order. I process through the ‚Äúhelp‚Äù tab, I do not want a refund I want the food I ordered for my wife. Consistently we have one of our meals left at the resturant even though we ordered two. The only solution offered by the horrible support service is a refund for your food. Not for the tip, not for the delivery fee, just the food. So if I actually want my order I have to go back and spend even MORE on those things when it wasn‚Äôt right the first time. Let me be clear when I say this has happened CONSOSTENTLY. It‚Äôs one thing if things are forgotten, but to pay MORE to have what was forgotten re-delivered? Horrible service.",2
doordash,719972451,2022-09-14 17:39:40,Do not use this crap,"At least half of the dashers will be people too incompetent to get hired at any job. You‚Äôll buy an $8 meal but after Doordash fees and tip it‚Äôll be $22. Oh, but you can spend $12 a month to get rid of scummy fees, but only if what you order is over $10 in food ü§∑üèº‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è you‚Äôre better off spending that money on gas and going to get your food yourself. 
I ordered a burger for me and nuggets with fries for my girlfriend, we received only the fries. Doordash at least let‚Äôs you refund if there‚Äôs a problem‚Ä¶ only one item though ü§∑üèº‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è 

Go get your food yourself. Do not overpay to have some disgusting unsanitary random stranger to handle your food. I have had instances where the seal was broken and we suddenly have 6 fries total.

doordash,719972451,2022-10-15 23:08:18,Does Not Handle Archiving of Old Orders Gracefully,"Functionally a fine app. But note to Devs: when you go to pull up an old order that is VERY old and thus probably not archived anymore, it fails in an ugly way. For example, rather than showing a page saying that there was an error, it shows a white screen with something that someone on the backend would want to see (‚Äúsomething goes wrong to fetch order with detail,‚Ä¶‚Äù). The message changes depending on the order, but if you click the same order over and over the message that is shown stays the same. Maybe something to fix for the next version?",4
doordash,719972451,2022-11-05 17:18:22,Love this technology,"As much I‚Äôm not a fan of new technologies today but in all due reality this has been amazing just like Uber eats. But DoorDash has been allot easier to use other than Uber eats. Especially for people like me who gets tired coming home from work cause I work graveyards and I do get tired to go anywhere‚Ä¶. I give thanks to the people who is willing to deliver food and other convenience stuff.. and also along with Uber I am thankful for that technology as well to give people rides and from where ever they needed to be‚Ä¶ I am grateful for both feature..

That‚Äôs ridiculous. Between all of the extra fees and increase on food items, it‚Äôs cheaper for me to just use gas and pick up directly from the restaurant instead of going through DD. At least the restaurant won‚Äôt charge the extra fees (and I‚Äôm a Dash Pass member too..). Is DD pocketing the difference between what the restaurant charges and what‚Äôs on the app??",3
doordash,719972451,2022-12-19 06:02:48,Such horrible customer service,I scheduled ahead of time a delivery of pizzas for a party we had planned and after the time the pizza should have arrived I received a call from door dash customer service telling me that my order would need to be canceled because it couldn't be fullfilled but I could try reordering the same order again (which wouldve taken up to 2 hours to fulfill). The customer service person actually hung up on me when I inquired why I would reorder with no garuntee that it'd be fulfilled. I have never left a bad review before but this isn't the first problem I've encountered with door dash nor the first time I've been hung up on by them. I will not be renewing my membership and I suggest you look at other options for your food delivery service. This company is horrible.,1
doordash,719972451,2022-12-09 08:45:59,I deleted for the lack of integrity,"So, I have been using this app for a year. I have been having a problem to get my order as the dasher in my area keep not delivering my order and it takes three days to get my refund. There is no way to contact your dasher as from one call to the customer service they stated that the number in the app is not related to dasher but to the assistant or something like that. It‚Äôs just very easy for the dasher to submit that the order was dropped off, but there is no integrity check even though ‚Äútechnology now can detect food package using AI and machine learning‚Äù. However, it was easy to request a refund, but how could they refund the wasted time? So I decided to eat healthy and not waste time. Also I am a student, so getting my refund in three days is a big deal to me.",1

Started ordering from this Taco Bell that constantly messed up my orders. First 3 times DD refunded my money instantly, it was away s 2 small items. Then one day they said no more refunds. Got on with help center. They refused to help. Kept sending robot responses. I said cool you are just doing your job, please send confirmation you have sent this issue further up the chain, I even have video proof of me opening the food bags. No confirmation email. No reply to me requesting that I wanted a confirmation email. They would close the chat, i would re open it and they kept shutting down the chat. I would expect this of a scam caller, but not a big corporation. Very garbage.",1
doordash,719972451,2022-10-11 19:42:47,Pay your Dashers so I don‚Äôt have to,"It‚Äôs painfully obvious that you don‚Äôt pay your Dashers as you should. Tipping them as much as I am, I feel like I am footing the paycheck. You shouldn‚Äôt suggest as much as you do, and I shouldn‚Äôt have to tip like I do. 

Also. At least give me the opportunity to give a tip AFTER I receive the meal. Why would I tip without knowing what the service quality is. It doesn‚Äôt make any sense. Half the time there is an issue with the order of delivery time is wrong. And I‚Äôm not new here. I‚Äôve spent a good portion of my income receiving food. 

I still love the service option, but you need to adjust the cost, because I can compare to other services that clearly don‚Äôt try and make me feel bad about offering a tip I can afford. And a tip is for extra, not for the expected service.",1
doordash,719972451,2022-10-05 00:05:29,Good but pricy,"The app is pretty good, great even at times, but it‚Äôs getting ridiculous with the delivery fees. Before it was just $5 for the extra fees on your meal but now it can range anywhere from $10 to $15 bucks with every order. The delivery drivers are great but if you at least want to give them a tip of $5, it‚Äôs nearly $15 to $20 on top of your order that‚Äôs already expensive depending on how much you‚Äôre ordering and I usually go for the cheap stuff

Imagine ordering from McDonald‚Äôs for a $6 meal and end up spending $20 to $25 bucks just for one person. It can definitely be pricy if you‚Äôre trying to budget and have no car to do pickups. The app is great but it definitely needs work",3
doordash,719972451,2022-09-27 03:20:53,There‚Äôs a chance that someone can just take your food and money,"I‚Äôve been using Doordash for a few months and it‚Äôs been great. This is the first time something bad had happened and it‚Äôs made me nervous that stuff like this can happen more often so I‚Äôm taking a break from this app for now. A person named Amy was supposed to give me my food that I payed $21 for and she ended up taking it. She never moved from her spot on the map, wouldn‚Äôt answer my texts, and when I tried to call her it said that her phone is not in service anymore. There was nothing else I can do besides canceling it after waiting an hour and getting $20 worth of credits for a next order on the app.",3
doordash,719972451,2022-09-30 11:28:20,Do you want to pay a premium for the wrong food 50% of the time?!,"Then this is the app for you! Did you order some nice soup and an iced coffee for lunch? Well, you‚Äôll probably receive a pizza and a small order of rice. Did you order a late night pretzel and some coffee to get some work done? Well, congratulations on your new Q-Tips and deodorant. Be prepared for missing items as well (like the quesadilla that was conveniently missing from my last order).

In all seriousness, there‚Äôs probably a 50% chance you‚Äôre going to get the right items and you‚Äôre going to pay a premium on them. Anyone can be a Doordasher, and without serious oversight and punishment for dashers nothing will ever change.

Use at your own risk or use if you want to get some random food or pharmacy items! Random is fun sometimes.",1

She then proceeded to tell me I had to speak Spanish. I cannot speak Spanish beautiful language but I can‚Äôt speak it. So to be told she can‚Äôt bring my food because I can‚Äôt direct her in Spanish to my house is absolutely ridiculous! Door Dash doesn‚Äôt do anything to make it right. Didn‚Äôt give me credit after they said they would. So I had no dinner and my food never came. They lied and said they were going to escalate the issue and see me an email. Both of those things were a lie.

We waited over an hour for him to get a notification that the food was here. It‚Äôs not. The food is nowhere in sight and the picture the driver took is of a house down the street. The picture doesn‚Äôt even show the food, it‚Äôs just a photo of the neighbors house taken from the driver‚Äôs car. He asked the neighbor and no one dropped any food off there. When he tried to reach out to customer service, the agent ended the chat out of nowhere while he was trying to type his response. 

I‚Äôve driven for DoorDash before and if I got a $10 tip, I would do everything in my power to make sure that customer received good service.",1
doordash,719972451,2022-11-30 00:21:56,Why does it refresh??,"I love Door Dash. I really do. But when you click on a restaurant to look at their offerings, and then go back to the main list, ultimately the whole app refreshes and brings you to the top of the page. It‚Äôs ***incredibly*** frustrating to then have to scroll back down to where you were. Often times, after this happening a couple times, I switch to UberEats and buy through them. I get that maybe a restaurant or two has gone offline in that time and they‚Äôre reflecting that change, but why not just keep those restaurants on the page and reflect that they‚Äôre closed until the user refreshes the page.",3
doordash,719972451,2022-10-05 14:08:09,No,This has got to be one of the worst and most pathetic app I‚Äôve used! First off why have 50% discounts and not even take out 50% off your total order?! Secondly why have an app as a food delivery service when yah look severely understaffed I ordered sum not too long ago and by the time my food got there it was basically frozen solid!!! And yah really gone mean to tell me that every time I order I‚Äôm gonna have cold food cause yah struggling to look for dashers when I‚Äôm in the city as well like c‚Äômon now it‚Äôs really pathetic on yah end for real like don‚Äôt have a service like this if yah gonna keep delaying my order cause yah need to look for people to deliver only to have me wait more than 2 hrs just to have someone deliver a simple order PLEASE DON‚ÄôT EVER ORDER USING THIS SERVICE EVER AGAIN!!!

This app can also just help you find other places to eat and what the menus and prices will be I keep it on my phone just in case I‚Äôm ever in a situation where I have into use it but I barley ever use this app because of the money tax,1
doordash,719972451,2022-09-22 18:48:21,Spectacularly Bad,"Between the up charges, the dashers who will drop your food off at the wrong house or at the driveway and not the front door and the customer service that goes through an entire script before you can get a refund for a delivery never showing up, I can‚Äôt recommend this for anyone. Plus we need to get back to a lifestyle of picking up our own food rather than paying 40% more after charges and tips to have it brought to us. On the flip side, having driven for DoorDash and Postmates in 2020 when my job was on hiatus, I can heartily encourage you to support Postmates if you must order delivery. Their drivers are treated much better and have better earning potential‚Ä¶ and it shows cause I‚Äôve never had a problem with a Postmates driver dropping food off at the door.",1

Recently, Doordash has updated how they do deliveries and they will have a dasher do multiple stops and don‚Äôt come  straight to me. Now, instead of the estimated 20-30 minute delivery, I will about 1 hour before I get my food. It‚Äôs very frustrating because my food is cold/soggy. Unless I add the extra fee to have it come straight to me, I have to wait for low quality food that I could‚Äôve gotten myself in a shorter time. As a loyal customer for 4 years, I‚Äôm very disappointed in the new way they are running their business and will no longer be using their app.",2
doordash,719972451,2022-12-15 17:36:21,Better packaging for orders NEEDED,Companies that partner with door dash should do better about providing quality and acceptable packaging for delivery orders to ensure the customer‚Äôs food isn‚Äôt tampered with. Door dash should include this in their policies if company‚Äôs wish to partner with doordash to extend their services through delivery. Some places use brown packaging bags that are sealed with a sticker and stapled to ensure the food is not tampered with yet some places only place the food within a plastic bag with no stability and double tie the bag as if the dasher cannot untie the knot and tamper with the contents. This should be heavily considered by the higher ups at door dash more so from a public health and safety standpoint to ensure more quality services is being provided for users of their services.,2
doordash,719972451,2022-10-08 03:39:33,Food Delivery app,"Of all the food delivery services door dash is truthfully the best one you can get. It has the best stores, the best customer service, and it does grocery items. Even the paid pass is worth it, especially if you order from the grocery a lot.   There is not a better option than door dash. It‚Äôs the Swiss Army knife of these apps. Easy to use and decent prices. 

Came back to update my review, I‚Äôm continuing to love the app!!! It is truely the best food delivery service you can get. 10/10 this app gets it right. I can‚Äôt recommend it enough",5
doordash,719972451,2022-12-10 22:56:58,Not Worth It,"I used DoorDash all the time and had no problems until recently. I even purchased the DashPass at one point since I used it so frequently. However, recent their app has had nothing but issues. It crashes all the time, it always reloads and says it‚Äôs too busy, and I am frequently left with incorrect orders or missing items. The most ridiculous part of all is the prices and fees. It‚Äôs just not worth it for the poor service. If you are left without your dinner like I was last weekend, (because it wasn‚Äôt delivered with the rest of my food) all you can get is a refund. Then they charge you the same fees again to have it delivered. Between the poor app performance and the lack of customer care, I will be taking my business elsewhere.",1
doordash,719972451,2022-09-16 22:44:46,Paying for Instant delivery is a scam!!,"As a longtime DoorDash user, it‚Äôs absolutely appalling for the company to constantly raise rates on delivery service by introducing things such as Instant delivery. This capitalistic mindset from the business is creating an unstable experience for customers Who wants to use the service at an affordable price. Most people who use the regular service are paying up to $10+ in fees and tips which was not the case a few months ago. While using the ‚Äúnew standard service‚Äù, my food is arriving much later and colder than usually. As a consumer, it‚Äôs starting to be apparent that I‚Äôm better off buying my items at the location instead of using DoorDash. Or just use a different service all together.",2

My first order was for a wing place and I typed my order in and made sure everything was right opened it to check 99% of my food I had on there was gone and it was already here before I found out so at delivery I got one thing I order potato wedges and nothing else. Then again today I received the wrong order again. Something is going on I didn‚Äôt even receive what was on my receipt, was some other persons food. Yes Ik sounds bad ordering it like that but I‚Äôm 17 and not allowed to really cook a lot of things and my moms out of town on a weekend vacation. It‚Äôs very unbecoming bc every experience before was absolutely wonderful whys it going bad now.",1

But, there are 2 problems about DoorDash. Number one is that it takes 40-50 minutes to get to you. Usually it‚Äôs in the forty‚Äôs, but sometimes it takes longer. Number two is that sometimes they mix the orders or something is missing from the meal. Also, if you/we get someone‚Äôs else‚Äôs order, what if we are allergic to their food, or their allergic to our food. That might be a problem. But, other than that, I love DoorDash and I would recommend getting DoorDash. üòÅ",4

Not only did the customer service reps deny that my order wasn‚Äôt received, but they literally went in and CHANGED my address to coincide with their story being that I had given the wrong address. That wasn‚Äôt true because I ordered the same meal the day before to the correct address and pressed ‚Äúreorder‚Äù and confirmed my meal without making any changes. Then, they ended the conversation when I was trying to speak with a supervisor. This company is deceitful. I was a loyal customer for a long time and deleted my account tonight because they not only lied, but also refused to refund me my money after I didn‚Äôt receive my order. Terrible customer service - the worst of them all.",1
doordash,719972451,2022-10-08 17:34:09,"Fantastic App, however strange extra charges","When you order delivery, they tack on ‚Äúfees and taxes‚Äù onto your order. You would imagine this would include the taxes on your food, however, everything on the menu is also raised a few dollars for some apparent reason. The food and service is great, there are discounts, promo codes, and such. But I don‚Äôt want to pay 30 dollars for 4 chicken sandwiches from Popeyes. I might as well get chick fil-a at that point. 

Otherwise, fantastic app, reaches out to multiple restaurants that are difficult to get too, as well as offering a premium that reduces your taxes.",4
doordash,719972451,2022-09-23 17:47:14,Don‚Äôt use DoorDash,I ordered food then double dashed a bag a chips from another store. Instead of them having one dasher do the delivery they had two different dashers. But the first dasher received both orders and when he went to get the chips my order for him disappeared because they sent the second dasher for the chips. I spoke with the first dasher and he said he spoke with DoorDash and they told him he canceled the order himself which he didn‚Äôt they sent a second dasher and just lied to him. Not to mention the second dasher delivered the chips to the wrong address and DoorDash refused to refund me for it. I canceled my dash pass and will never use this app again. They refused to take the blame or solve the problem your better off with postmates or Uber eats. Save yourself the trouble do NOT use this app.,1

If I really want cookies but the kids are already asleep (single mom)‚Ä¶.I rely on DoorDash and Dashers in my community for little things to help my daily schedule. Thanks to Dashers especially!",5

But (for my order at least) it‚Äôs insane that if I were to go and pick up my order myself, it would have been $10. My order with DoorDash is close to $30. Inflation has screwed all of us. This feeds in to the memes about DoorDash that a $5 meal costs $60 hahahah Again, this is not a negative review, I am fully happy with your service, I suppose this is just a comment about the times that we are living in.

The customer support were only somewhat helpful and in the end I lost about $10 when I tally all up. It feels like you are always overcharged for the bill you get apart from the service and the tips and this is not fair considering I‚Äôm already a member. 

I‚Äôve been using doordash SINCE the pandemic and I‚Äôve had the same issue over and over. 

I never write reviews but I‚Äôve never been this frustrated with doordash for the degree of dishonesty I‚Äôve dealt with over the years. I cannot hope for them to improve anymore. Absolutely terrible.",1

The process of buying it online with door dash was easy, what ruined it for me is at some point from ordering the food and receiving it, it got spilled every where in the bag. Im talking gravy and potatoes opened up and made everything a mess including the chicken, kinda made it all far less appetizing. Like imagine putting your entire meal in a bucket and putting it in one of the paint mixers that shakes it to ensure it‚Äôs well mixed.

They screwed up my order, twice for the same order, trying to get any customer service was a nightmare. The chat option sucked and agents just trying to placate me instead of just doing what I asked: issuing a full refund. They keep sending me emails saying they‚Äôre trying to call me, when I haven‚Äôt gotten any calls from anyone from doordash. In the emails they say I can respond to that within 72 hours, when I do I get no response. Just a terrible experience all around.",1

We contacted their legal team and informed local police, but DoorDash ghosted us for two weeks. All right, we used our local police to subpoena the drivers information to get the incident paid for.
 
We used DoorDash a couple times last week, but today, they decided to deactivate both of our accounts instead of complying with us. You‚Äôve lost our business permanently. Extremely unprofessional, and I look forward to your downfall for poor customer service.",1

Nickeled and dimed to death and the long fall of the stock price reflects I am not the only ditching door dash. 

Service fee plus monthly fee plus city fee plus tip all on top of the order. Comes out to about $10 for delivery. Promos were worth it but now even those are not really a discount. 3 dollars off an order for ordering 2 coke products that add up to 6 dollars is not a discount, it is an upsell.

Really need to figure out what‚Äôs going on ther as it has persisted through several app updates and it‚Äôs still going.

Zero communication from door dasher driver.  No help from Door Dash.  Eventually called and finally talked to a human later in the week. She politely said she cannot help me and that it was peculiar that there was no picture taken or notes from dasher.  Guess I‚Äôm out the $50 bucks and inflated tip.

They also don‚Äôt allow you to tip afterwards, which to me is completely unacceptable. Nothing but bad experiences. 0/5.

Also absolutely ridiculous to charge huge fees on top of the items already being priced higher on the app. My most recent order that would normally be a 15$ meal if you pick it up yourself costed me 40$ through the app.",1

There were multiple times where they could not find a dasher and my order was set back about a half hour- an hour.  Also, the cancellation to credits only works if you have the dash pass, so I did end up lossing over $40 on an order because of that.

But unfortunately, my recent experience has been abysmal. May be they don‚Äôt care Saphire preferred subscribers as much as the normal dashpass subscribers as I see a change in their behavior since I moved to this new subscription. 

I ordered food the other day, the dasher arrived half an hour later than originally estimated doordash time and then he tried to hand over food which was clearly not mine. He informed me that the food vendor hasn‚Äôt provided any receipt as well. I rejected the food saying that it‚Äôs not the food I ordered and immediately contacted the support. That took a wild turn where I started getting bizzare replies like we will get back to you in 24 hours. They literally left me hungry and had to get food elsewhere. 

Later I got a strange email saying ‚Äúexceeded recent compensations‚Äù. I personally never asked me to compensate for anything before. The worst thing is there was absolutely no investigation as what happened to my order. In any case, I didn‚Äôt get my food and I lost my money. I‚Äôm gutted.",1

Significantly more expensive than calling in an order.   Prices are increased + fees.  Ultimately I deleted my account due to the lack of issue resolution as many drivers leave food outside or missing items.  There is a particularly large issue where most restaurants don‚Äôt list there condiments so even if you call and request them they will often not arrive with your meal.",3
doordash,719972451,2022-10-11 18:06:19,Never goes as planned,"Something always goes wrong with every order. Often it takes 2x as long as the original estimate to get the food. Other times drivers will leave food at the completely wrong location. Most recently the driver texted me to say the restaurant never got the order and I have to cancel and retry.

From the users perspective it‚Äôs pretty clear: here‚Äôs my order, here‚Äôs the money, please bring it to my location. On the backend, it‚Äôs an absolute disaster of restaurants and drivers getting paid way too little to put any effort in, and the result is something goes wrong.

Order directly from the restaurant when you can. Pick it up yourself when you can. Use doordash as a last result and keep your expectations low.",1
doordash,719972451,2022-10-06 02:07:07,Horrible Customer Support,"I‚Äôve used Door Dash for years in college, but recently it seems every order I have is missing at least one item. This might not be an issue for people who have endless time, because that‚Äôs what you need to get through their gauntlet of employees all telling you the same few lines of how sorry they are. Honestly, I‚Äôve discovered it‚Äôs best to just accept whatever automated deal they offer because that‚Äôs all their going to give even after a 2 hour text conversation. 

Not to mention they did NOTHING when I was verbally harassed by one of their drivers. I‚Äôm sure he‚Äôs still out driving and threatening even more customers. 

If you have this app, uninstall it. If you‚Äôre considering getting it, don‚Äôt.",1
doordash,719972451,2022-09-11 12:34:11,HORRIBLE experience !!,The app is only good for delivering food and the food at most times isn‚Äôt even worth it which has nothing to do with the app itself but this app is so money hungry and greedy that If you do have a mistake with your order or your DoorDasher is unavailable to complete it u can only get a refund in tips and not the full price. Also I just accidentally spent $96 on a yearly subscription that I now have to use because I cannot contact them to get a refund or switch it to the monthly subscription like I wanted it . I honestly hate this app at this point and have had many many issues with it I do not recommend it to anyone anymore and I can‚Äôt wait for my subscription to be up so I never have to use it again!,1
doordash,719972451,2022-12-14 08:15:52,Terrible performance issues,"I‚Äôve reported this issue multiple times with no response besides your half-baked outsourced customer support that can barely understand the issue because of their English skills. Convenience stores do not load. Any convenience store whether it‚Äôs Walgreen‚Äôs, 7-11, DashMart, doesn‚Äôt matter. The screen will freeze up, go white, load stuff in at a painfully slow rate, then crash. It‚Äôs not my phone because everything works just fine even while the app is frozen. I‚Äôve tried every piece of advice from both DoorDash and third parties online. 

After reading through recent reviews, I‚Äôm not the only one dealing with this. Figure it out bros.",2
doordash,719972451,2022-11-11 17:41:58,Horrible Customer Service,I made an order for breakfast over 30 minutes before the menu would change. Got confirmation right away from the restaurant. It took another 20 minutes to be notified that they didn‚Äôt have a dasher in the area. Probably something you should have before you allow someone to put in the order. Another 40 minutes go by and I get informed that they can‚Äôt process my order at all because breakfast time was over. All I got from the customer service was that my order was cancelled. There needs to be some other reimbursement than just giving the payment back and there needs to be some way for you to ensure there‚Äôs a dasher before someone can put in an order.,1
doordash,719972451,2022-09-14 01:58:44,Variety of Great Coupons!,"I don‚Äôt ever write reviews but I feel compelled to with doordash. I‚Äôm also not one to order out often, since it allows more room for restaurants to mess up your order‚Ä¶. but how can you not when doordash offers a variety of good deals? Whenever I see a promotion, I jump on it. I‚Äôve paid as little as $2 for a meal that usually costs $25! Sometimes they have 75% off coupons, a steal. Anyways, it‚Äôs worth the download, and worth the time writing this review. Now back to eating my Poke‚Ä¶",5
doordash,719972451,2022-11-04 23:44:05,Cold Food,"Update: Just ordered a meal for our family. When it got here, a third of the order was missing. Used the chat function in the app and the response was essentially ‚ÄúWe don‚Äôt care that you‚Äôre family is still hungry. Here‚Äôs a few bucks worth of refund. Better luck next time.‚Äù  Joke is on them. There‚Äôs not going to be a next time. 

The app works fine. The service is the issue. DoorDash let‚Äôs it‚Äôs drivers take on multiple deliveries at once, so it‚Äôs not uncommon for your food to ride around in the driver‚Äôs vehicle for 20-30 minutes. By the time it arrives, it‚Äôs lukewarm at best. Also, you need to make it to where the customer can tip the driver AFTER delivery. Tipping beforehand based on the hope that your food will arrive is NOT gratuity.",1
doordash,719972451,2022-10-09 01:51:21,Horrible experience!,If I could give them zero stars I would! I placed a big order today through the restaurant online delivery service and when I received my food and opened my containers the delivery driver put it upon himself to eat my food and leave the scraps in the containers and still delivered it to me and took my tips. I contacted the restaurant first and then contacted door dash and the door dash customer service department said that he would put a ticket in with the restaurant to refund my money which right there I have an issue with because it wasn‚Äôt the restaurant‚Äôs fault that door dash delivery guy DeRon W. Of Indianapolis Indiana decided to eat my food and he said well we will put it in for him to never deliver to your address again HE SHOULDNT EVEN BE DELIVERING TO ANYONES ADDRESS,1
doordash,719972451,2022-09-28 18:08:39,Inconsistent & Misleading,"The double dash (adding on to an order from an additional vendor) NEVER works. 
Also I have entered my ID into the app and verified that is correct multiple times. Still every single alcohol order ends up taking the delivery person ages to enter and half the time the app crashes on them halfway through and they have to start over. 
So basically I end up paying twice the delivery fees and watch a complete stranger take every bit of information from my ID which is already loaded into the app every time an order involves alcohol. 
To add to the frustration, the two times I reported mistakes in my order, not a single thing was done to correct or refund.",2
doordash,719972451,2022-09-21 22:07:25,"Good restaurant options, terrible interface","Every time I use Doordash on my laptop there is a 30 second lag between click and the action going through. Sometimes I click add an item and it doesn't work. I have Dash credits but wanted to use my credit card to pay for a meal and the app / website would not let me. Overall horrible interface design. Not to mention they not only charge extra fees, but also raise the price you see on the menu from the actual price the restaurant charges. All things considered, you pay like $8-10 more on each order because of Doordash. The only reason I keep coming back is for the good restaurant selection.",2
doordash,719972451,2022-09-16 04:22:50,I love DoorDash but..,"Soo I love the convenience of DoorDash but man.. do they have some problems. The app it‚Äôs self is seamless and well built, but everything else is awful. From the dashers themselves, the inflated priced on items (even if you purchase their ‚Äòdash pass‚Äô), the inaccurate map- to them not holding their Dasher‚Äôs accountable for marking orders ‚Äúwaiting for order‚Äù where then half way across the city or doing multiple deliveries when they‚Äôve marked as your ordering being close by. It‚Äôs infuriating. Orders always show up cold, and half heartedly delivered. It‚Äôs difficult to support a business that doesn‚Äôt hold their employees accountable. I‚Äôll enjoy UberEats for this reason and use DoorDash when I have too.",2
doordash,719972451,2022-09-13 21:12:26,No refund for this???,"If I could just load the pictures of how horrible my order arrived I would. The driver had my order in her car for 30-40 minutes prior. We had a hot sub, two hotdogs and two milkshakes. The hot food was absolutely cold and fell apart, soggy bread, etc. our milkshakes were so warm that it melted the whipped topping and definitely wasn‚Äôt a milkshake anymore. DoorDash is refusing to refund even after sending them pictures of my order. After several attempts I finally reported them to the BBB. I am also going to dispute the charges with my bank. As per law if a customer does not receive the product as it should be. A full refund will be issued. I will fight this until I get my money back. I have everything I need to win this.",1
