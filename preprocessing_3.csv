1,25,grubhub,302920553,2022-11-06 07:44:28,Will block you for anything,for example i will have two deliveries my first delivery pick up would be my last drop off,1
1,26,grubhub,302920553,2022-11-06 07:44:28,Will block you for anything,the time stamp would be to drop my second delivery off first at 338 but my first delivery time stamp would be 336 how is that even possible,1

1,29,grubhub,302920553,2022-11-06 07:44:28,Will block you for anything,i am only following what is giving to me,1
1,30,grubhub,302920553,2022-11-06 07:44:28,Will block you for anything,also you would get a delivery request but the restaurant would just be getting it when you arrive and you you will have to wait for the order to be done,1

3,49,grubhub,302920553,2022-09-26 20:18:27,"So far, so Good!",i am requesting a reorder once again because i have tracked the last driver and he or she was in my neighborhood and i am not sure if they were lost or not but it would be nice if they were use the gps system more effectively so that they can find my address,1

7,108,grubhub,302920553,2022-09-20 03:35:53,Grub Hub is not 24/7,and then i get another delay and then another next thing i know my order is not going to arrive until an hour and a half past when it was originally going to arrive,1
7,109,grubhub,302920553,2022-09-20 03:35:53,Grub Hub is not 24/7,i noticed that when i went to the home screen where all the restaurants are they had all closed,1
7,110,grubhub,302920553,2022-09-20 03:35:53,Grub Hub is not 24/7,when i searched places such as insomnia cookie which stays open very late it said they were still open but it was not appearing on the home screen,1
7,111,grubhub,302920553,2022-09-20 03:35:53,Grub Hub is not 24/7,this meant there were no delivery drivers to actually deliver my order now and grubhub does not know how to handle this when it happens,1

8,123,grubhub,302920553,2022-09-28 01:20:41,Worst Food Delivery App,if they cannot find my residence they call me ask questions and eventually deliver my food,1
8,124,grubhub,302920553,2022-09-28 01:20:41,Worst Food Delivery App,i always tip the drivers because i appreciate them delivering my food,1
8,125,grubhub,302920553,2022-09-28 01:20:41,Worst Food Delivery App,however there are some drivers who do not even attempt to deliver my food do not go above and beyond to make sure i get what i ordered and are either rude or do not answer my callstexts after they have dropped off my food at the door but it is nowhere to be found,1
8,126,grubhub,302920553,2022-09-28 01:20:41,Worst Food Delivery App,it is a waste of time money and food ordering through grubhub,1
8,127,grubhub,302920553,2022-09-28 01:20:41,Worst Food Delivery App,yes my money gets refunded when i contact customer support,1
8,128,grubhub,302920553,2022-09-28 01:20:41,Worst Food Delivery App,what i would like to know is why do not they update their apps navigation to prevent the drivers from not being able to find the home,1
8,129,grubhub,302920553,2022-09-28 01:20:41,Worst Food Delivery App,why do not the drivers go out of their way to contact the customer,1
8,130,grubhub,302920553,2022-09-28 01:20:41,Worst Food Delivery App,why do not the drivers respond to texts or calls,1
8,131,grubhub,302920553,2022-09-28 01:20:41,Worst Food Delivery App,it is beyond aggravating going through this time and time again,1
8,132,grubhub,302920553,2022-09-28 01:20:41,Worst Food Delivery App,i am deleting this and going to use uber eats or door dash instead,1
9,133,grubhub,302920553,2022-09-12 02:06:49,Money back true but…,i agree with the reviewer who said that customer service only response is to refund your  but not to make it right,4
9,134,grubhub,302920553,2022-09-12 02:06:49,Money back true but…,in this post covid job apocalypseit would be better if a company with his big name in food delivery as grubhub would value their drivers and delivery people a little higher and give them credit for doing the job that they are doing,4
9,135,grubhub,302920553,2022-09-12 02:06:49,Money back true but…,i would not do the job myself but i am glad there are people who do since i am a handicap shut inbut i have struggled with walmart over almost 3 months to get them to honor the price quoted by one of their vendors,4
9,136,grubhub,302920553,2022-09-12 02:06:49,Money back true but…,apparently there are no companies anymore who value and honor their employees,4
9,137,grubhub,302920553,2022-09-12 02:06:49,Money back true but…,the bigger they are the less they care,4
9,138,grubhub,302920553,2022-09-12 02:06:49,Money back true but…,i wish there were someone out there who would create a delivery service where the money went all to the restaurant and  drivers and all the service did was broker their servicesalas we do not live in that world,4
9,139,grubhub,302920553,2022-09-12 02:06:49,Money back true but…,for whatever it is worth grubhub seems to serve things up just as well as any other delivery service i had to use,4
10,140,grubhub,302920553,2022-09-21 02:43:15,Horrible customer service,i received a text saying my order was delivered by the front door,2
10,141,grubhub,302920553,2022-09-21 02:43:15,Horrible customer service,i went outside,2

10,143,grubhub,302920553,2022-09-21 02:43:15,Horrible customer service,i texted the driver asking him where he left it,2
10,144,grubhub,302920553,2022-09-21 02:43:15,Horrible customer service,he says under the mailbox which did not make much sense given where the mailroom is in my building,2
10,145,grubhub,302920553,2022-09-21 02:43:15,Horrible customer service,i then described my building and asked him if that is where he left it,2
10,146,grubhub,302920553,2022-09-21 02:43:15,Horrible customer service,he texts back no,2
10,147,grubhub,302920553,2022-09-21 02:43:15,Horrible customer service,i asked him what address he left it at,2
10,148,grubhub,302920553,2022-09-21 02:43:15,Horrible customer service,he texts back that he does not have that information and there is nothing else he can do to help me,2
10,149,grubhub,302920553,2022-09-21 02:43:15,Horrible customer service,i went to the app and tried to use the chat to talk to customer service,2
10,150,grubhub,302920553,2022-09-21 02:43:15,Horrible customer service,i was in a queue for a while,2
10,151,grubhub,302920553,2022-09-21 02:43:15,Horrible customer service,then someone finally joined the chat,2
10,152,grubhub,302920553,2022-09-21 02:43:15,Horrible customer service,they did not type anything or respond to anything,2
10,153,grubhub,302920553,2022-09-21 02:43:15,Horrible customer service,after 10 minutes of no response in the chat i found the customer service number and called them,2
10,154,grubhub,302920553,2022-09-21 02:43:15,Horrible customer service,after a bit of time on hold i finally talked to someone and explained what happened,2
10,155,grubhub,302920553,2022-09-21 02:43:15,Horrible customer service,she said she would reorder it for me but did not offer any discount or coupon or anything,2
10,156,grubhub,302920553,2022-09-21 02:43:15,Horrible customer service,she did not even really apologize,2
10,157,grubhub,302920553,2022-09-21 02:43:15,Horrible customer service,i finally received my order over an hour late,2
10,158,grubhub,302920553,2022-09-21 02:43:15,Horrible customer service,no discount no coupon no apology nothing,2
11,159,grubhub,302920553,2022-11-12 01:10:08,Unwilling Drivers to Find my House,i had 2 experiences where the driver could not find my house,1
11,160,grubhub,302920553,2022-11-12 01:10:08,Unwilling Drivers to Find my House,poor directions from grubhub,1
11,161,grubhub,302920553,2022-11-12 01:10:08,Unwilling Drivers to Find my House,i live on a busy street right across from a high school with a unique tower above the garage and the drivers still could not find it,1
11,162,grubhub,302920553,2022-11-12 01:10:08,Unwilling Drivers to Find my House,i even had one delivery person leave my order at the wrong house and do nothing,1
11,163,grubhub,302920553,2022-11-12 01:10:08,Unwilling Drivers to Find my House,sometimes i do not have a car and so ordering my food to be delivered is the only way i can get it,1
11,164,grubhub,302920553,2022-11-12 01:10:08,Unwilling Drivers to Find my House,i have never had this problem with doordash or instacart,1
11,165,grubhub,302920553,2022-11-12 01:10:08,Unwilling Drivers to Find my House,i only started with grubhub because of a promotion from my work,1
11,166,grubhub,302920553,2022-11-12 01:10:08,Unwilling Drivers to Find my House,i decided to cancel my 10 a month membership after one of the drivers who drove past my house twice even with me telling him the directions very politely at the same time threaten to drive off with my order and not deliver it,1
11,167,grubhub,302920553,2022-11-12 01:10:08,Unwilling Drivers to Find my House,he then refused to drive into my driveway and had me run out to his truck to grab it,1
11,168,grubhub,302920553,2022-11-12 01:10:08,Unwilling Drivers to Find my House,once i did i said thank you,1
11,169,grubhub,302920553,2022-11-12 01:10:08,Unwilling Drivers to Find my House,and he said said uhhuh and drove off,1
11,170,grubhub,302920553,2022-11-12 01:10:08,Unwilling Drivers to Find my House,i get it he took longer to find my house but i did tip 20,1
11,171,grubhub,302920553,2022-11-12 01:10:08,Unwilling Drivers to Find my House,i should not have been treated like that,1
11,172,grubhub,302920553,2022-11-12 01:10:08,Unwilling Drivers to Find my House,i do work customer service and i do know how hard it can be but in this case how i was treated was unacceptable,1

12,174,grubhub,302920553,2022-12-18 07:26:03,Your negligence ruined my 30th birthday dinner,it was set to arrive at around 540 perfect for dinner time,1
12,175,grubhub,302920553,2022-12-18 07:26:03,Your negligence ruined my 30th birthday dinner,about 530 the driver called to tell me tucanos does not sell the thing i ordered,1
12,176,grubhub,302920553,2022-12-18 07:26:03,Your negligence ruined my 30th birthday dinner,when i asked her to ask them for a substitution they said they are not selling any takeout orders this month,1
12,177,grubhub,302920553,2022-12-18 07:26:03,Your negligence ruined my 30th birthday dinner,by the time i could order something else from doordash and have it arrive i was eating dinner at 7 while my kids were getting ready for bed they having had grilled cheeses,1
12,178,grubhub,302920553,2022-12-18 07:26:03,Your negligence ruined my 30th birthday dinner,you have one job grubhub app,1
12,179,grubhub,302920553,2022-12-18 07:26:03,Your negligence ruined my 30th birthday dinner,confirm the order so the driver can pick it up,1
12,180,grubhub,302920553,2022-12-18 07:26:03,Your negligence ruined my 30th birthday dinner,clearly tucanos did not confirm they could fill the order before you wasted my time and the drivers time on the order,1
12,181,grubhub,302920553,2022-12-18 07:26:03,Your negligence ruined my 30th birthday dinner,i hope you paid her,1
12,182,grubhub,302920553,2022-12-18 07:26:03,Your negligence ruined my 30th birthday dinner,your process requires revision,1
12,183,grubhub,302920553,2022-12-18 07:26:03,Your negligence ruined my 30th birthday dinner,you know what is worse than having to go get your own food because a restaurant will not do delivery,1
12,184,grubhub,302920553,2022-12-18 07:26:03,Your negligence ruined my 30th birthday dinner,having no food because your app dropped the ball,1
12,185,grubhub,302920553,2022-12-18 07:26:03,Your negligence ruined my 30th birthday dinner,i hope you fail by losing your customer base to doordashs superior app and process design,1
12,186,grubhub,302920553,2022-12-18 07:26:03,Your negligence ruined my 30th birthday dinner,update developer has responded to my complaint by asking me to use their contact us option on their site,1
12,187,grubhub,302920553,2022-12-18 07:26:03,Your negligence ruined my 30th birthday dinner,there is not actually a way to contact them at the link provided,1
13,188,grubhub,302920553,2022-11-13 18:11:42,Food is always late,i am done with grubhub after this order,2
13,189,grubhub,302920553,2022-11-13 18:11:42,Food is always late,every delivery is late,2
13,190,grubhub,302920553,2022-11-13 18:11:42,Food is always late,the restaurants provide the correct items but we always end up staring at our drivers on the map going to the restaurant then driving to the other end of the city before updating to say the order will be late and they have magically just picked up our food and are on the way,2
13,191,grubhub,302920553,2022-11-13 18:11:42,Food is always late,after complaining to grubhub twice recently about cold food both times they said they would issue a 5 makegood and neither time has that email been received,2
13,192,grubhub,302920553,2022-11-13 18:11:42,Food is always late,i always tip over 20 for the drivers but then end up with cold food,2
13,193,grubhub,302920553,2022-11-13 18:11:42,Food is always late,i wish there was the ability to tip after delivery rather than before,2
13,194,grubhub,302920553,2022-11-13 18:11:42,Food is always late,i also wish there was a way to ensure deliveries came straight from the restaurant to our door rather than being the third stop on the way 45 mins after the food leaves the restaurant,2
13,195,grubhub,302920553,2022-11-13 18:11:42,Food is always late,i understand we are paying for convenience of not leaving our house but the markups on all the food is ridiculous,2
13,196,grubhub,302920553,2022-11-13 18:11:42,Food is always late,you are basically paying three times the cost for poor quality,2
14,197,grubhub,302920553,2022-12-10 22:31:00,Grubhub Meal Delivery Service,i have never used meal delivery services that require a membership to be more affordable,4
14,198,grubhub,302920553,2022-12-10 22:31:00,Grubhub Meal Delivery Service,but not having to leave my house to shop for groceries and then spend time and effort making meals has been surprisingly rewardinggrubhub has changed the way i feel about being too lazy to do it myself because the convenience is a justified reward for worn out full time parents the elderly and disabled people,4
14,199,grubhub,302920553,2022-12-10 22:31:00,Grubhub Meal Delivery Service,ordering is so easy from a growing number of participating top fast food healthy and topnotch restaurants,4
14,200,grubhub,302920553,2022-12-10 22:31:00,Grubhub Meal Delivery Service,it is a little pricier but the minimal extra cost is well worth it,4
14,201,grubhub,302920553,2022-12-10 22:31:00,Grubhub Meal Delivery Service,average time from submitting an order to delivery at your door is about 2035 minutes or 4050 during holiday seasons,4
14,202,grubhub,302920553,2022-12-10 22:31:00,Grubhub Meal Delivery Service,and everything is hot fresh and ready to serve,4
14,203,grubhub,302920553,2022-12-10 22:31:00,Grubhub Meal Delivery Service,i have been happy with this apps service overall   however i do have occasional issues especially within the last 3 months or so  1,4
14,204,grubhub,302920553,2022-12-10 22:31:00,Grubhub Meal Delivery Service,orders that display a status of being prepared or on the way but are suddenly cancelled without explanation or notification,4
14,206,grubhub,302920553,2022-12-10 22:31:00,Grubhub Meal Delivery Service,orders that indicate delivery completed but never received,4
14,207,grubhub,302920553,2022-12-10 22:31:00,Grubhub Meal Delivery Service,these are always cases where they delivered to the wrong address,4
14,209,grubhub,302920553,2022-12-10 22:31:00,Grubhub Meal Delivery Service,and lastly orders that are missing items especially the drinks,4
14,210,grubhub,302920553,2022-12-10 22:31:00,Grubhub Meal Delivery Service,i still recommend this app and i still use it often but i want people to be aware that the service is not without occasional delays problems or issues,4
14,211,grubhub,302920553,2022-12-10 22:31:00,Grubhub Meal Delivery Service,rene w rene w,4
15,212,grubhub,302920553,2022-10-06 22:57:25,Horrible Customer Service,i have had to deal with their customer service several times,1
15,213,grubhub,302920553,2022-10-06 22:57:25,Horrible Customer Service,they have all been horrible experiences,1
15,214,grubhub,302920553,2022-10-06 22:57:25,Horrible Customer Service,there is no empathy to anyones situation and their solutions are laughable,1
15,215,grubhub,302920553,2022-10-06 22:57:25,Horrible Customer Service,tonight we placed an order and 10 minutes later i got a notification that it was cancelled and then a phone call letting me know my order was cancelled due to a restaurant error and i would get a refund within 5 days,1
15,216,grubhub,302920553,2022-10-06 22:57:25,Horrible Customer Service,we made other plans for dinner and we are sitting down to eat 40 minutes later when my phone rang and it was the restaurant that we originally ordered from asking if we were coming to pick up the order,1
15,217,grubhub,302920553,2022-10-06 22:57:25,Horrible Customer Service,i guess grubhub cancelled it on their own without telling the restaurant,1
15,218,grubhub,302920553,2022-10-06 22:57:25,Horrible Customer Service,i apologized as if i knew i would have gone over and picked it up myself,1
15,219,grubhub,302920553,2022-10-06 22:57:25,Horrible Customer Service,i went and read the email grubhub sent and they stated it was a delivery error but customer service blamed it on the restaurant,1
15,220,grubhub,302920553,2022-10-06 22:57:25,Horrible Customer Service,this is horrible for both the consumer and the restaurant that lost the money for food they prepared,1
15,221,grubhub,302920553,2022-10-06 22:57:25,Horrible Customer Service,we have had so many issues but i will not be wasting money on this anymore,1
16,222,grubhub,302920553,2022-10-30 18:51:05,Horrible!,horrible system just like seamless,1
16,223,grubhub,302920553,2022-10-30 18:51:05,Horrible!,do not follow there guarantee policy to cancel order if the order has not been confirmed yet,1
16,224,grubhub,302920553,2022-10-30 18:51:05,Horrible!,i have had problems with drivers eating my food delivering to the wrong location not reading my directions restaurants not following my specifications so because of that grubhub and seamless have dubbed my account suspicious of getting large amount of concessions so this would be a reason to not be able to follow there guarantee of canceling an order if you use the wrong credit card,1
16,225,grubhub,302920553,2022-10-30 18:51:05,Horrible!,they blame me not the drivers they hire or the restaurant that made the mistake or the fact that on multiple occasions i have lost my lunch hour due to there incompetence of not following directions or putting ingredients in my food that i am unable to eat or the restaurant is about 3 hours late delivering my food so they have a guarantee and i collect on that guarantee so if you do then your suspicious,1
16,226,grubhub,302920553,2022-10-30 18:51:05,Horrible!,i believe this company is run by a bunch of idiots,1

18,239,grubhub,302920553,2022-11-10 02:58:16,First and last time I will use this service,then all of a sudden the driver is switched to a different person who then drives to the same location to pick up my food,1
18,240,grubhub,302920553,2022-11-10 02:58:16,First and last time I will use this service,after a confirmation of my food being picked up and the driver coming all the way to my hotel parking lot calls me to question if i picked up my food already,1
18,241,grubhub,302920553,2022-11-10 02:58:16,First and last time I will use this service,i have been waiting over an hour order was delayed due to the driver switch just to then be accused that i picked up my own food,1
18,242,grubhub,302920553,2022-11-10 02:58:16,First and last time I will use this service,so after waiting all that time and then driving to my location to finally inform me my order was lost,1
18,243,grubhub,302920553,2022-11-10 02:58:16,First and last time I will use this service,i then get in touch with customer support who informs me it will take up to 5 days to be refunded and that my order could not be created as the place would not be able to make it  in time so then i had to figure out a different delivery as i was not going to risk my food being lost again through this terrible service,1
18,244,grubhub,302920553,2022-11-10 02:58:16,First and last time I will use this service,never using grubhub again,1
18,245,grubhub,302920553,2022-11-10 02:58:16,First and last time I will use this service,worst first experience,1
19,246,grubhub,302920553,2022-12-18 02:04:57,Horrible customer service,i have never had a good experience with this service and it is always been the drivers fault but today takes the cake,1
19,247,grubhub,302920553,2022-12-18 02:04:57,Horrible customer service,today we ordered and the order was delayed once which was expected due to how popular the restaurant is but then the order was picked up and then the driver took almost an hour to deliver the food at one point i kept track of his location and it remained stationary in the same spot for over 10 minutes when attempting to contact the driver there was no answer on his behalf,1
19,248,grubhub,302920553,2022-12-18 02:04:57,Horrible customer service,after going to grub hub to report this all they could say was sorry for the service and for the cold food heres 5 dollar credit that expires in 30 days when asking if anything else could be done they said they cannot do anything regarding their drivers,1
19,249,grubhub,302920553,2022-12-18 02:04:57,Horrible customer service,there is a lack of accountability with their drivers why would not they be able to cover for them it is their employees not the restaurants fault,1
19,250,grubhub,302920553,2022-12-18 02:04:57,Horrible customer service,i have now deleted the app and account and now they have lost a user,1
20,251,grubhub,302920553,2022-11-19 19:43:40,"Driver stole our food, customer service couldn't reorder",we ordered lunch at 1030 with an 1115 expected delivery,1
20,252,grubhub,302920553,2022-11-19 19:43:40,"Driver stole our food, customer service couldn't reorder",around 1135 we start wondering where our food is,1
20,253,grubhub,302920553,2022-11-19 19:43:40,"Driver stole our food, customer service couldn't reorder",no correspondence from our driver,1
20,254,grubhub,302920553,2022-11-19 19:43:40,"Driver stole our food, customer service couldn't reorder",i look on the app and it says our food has been delivered,1
20,255,grubhub,302920553,2022-11-19 19:43:40,"Driver stole our food, customer service couldn't reorder",we check all door locations no food,1
20,256,grubhub,302920553,2022-11-19 19:43:40,"Driver stole our food, customer service couldn't reorder",start chatting with customer service and they will not give the drivers number or any form of communication,1
20,257,grubhub,302920553,2022-11-19 19:43:40,"Driver stole our food, customer service couldn't reorder",they say the driver is no longer responding and that they cannot reprocess our order,1
20,258,grubhub,302920553,2022-11-19 19:43:40,"Driver stole our food, customer service couldn't reorder",by this time it is noon and to reorder there is a 5060 minute wait,1
20,259,grubhub,302920553,2022-11-19 19:43:40,"Driver stole our food, customer service couldn't reorder",we ordered 90 worth of food which they said they would refund within 35 days and offered a 10 coupon,1
20,260,grubhub,302920553,2022-11-19 19:43:40,"Driver stole our food, customer service couldn't reorder",so by 1230 we have no food we have an hour wait for anything else and we have a 10 reward to a company that clearly does not vet their drivers,1
20,261,grubhub,302920553,2022-11-19 19:43:40,"Driver stole our food, customer service couldn't reorder",i am sorry but 10 is not enough to make up for the severe inconvenience and lack of ability to make it right in a timely manner,1
20,262,grubhub,302920553,2022-11-19 19:43:40,"Driver stole our food, customer service couldn't reorder",will definitely be using different apps from here on out,1
21,263,grubhub,302920553,2022-11-01 14:01:24,Worst Food Delivery App,i absolutely hate this food app,1

21,266,grubhub,302920553,2022-11-01 14:01:24,Worst Food Delivery App,everytime i order from them my order is either canceled or a couple times it is extremely late,1
21,267,grubhub,302920553,2022-11-01 14:01:24,Worst Food Delivery App,one time i waited over 2 hours for a burrito from a place 10 min away,1
21,268,grubhub,302920553,2022-11-01 14:01:24,Worst Food Delivery App,i kept talking to customer service and they would not tell me if it was something with the restaurant or was it just that the driver was not going to pick it up from the place,1
21,269,grubhub,302920553,2022-11-01 14:01:24,Worst Food Delivery App,eventually after talking to about 3 customer service reps i canceled the order and went to get it myself,1
21,270,grubhub,302920553,2022-11-01 14:01:24,Worst Food Delivery App,they also did not want to give me a full refund for waiting over 2 hours when estimated delivery was 30 min,1
21,271,grubhub,302920553,2022-11-01 14:01:24,Worst Food Delivery App,a few other times my order was delivered in the dirt outside my apartment complex,1

21,274,grubhub,302920553,2022-11-01 14:01:24,Worst Food Delivery App,even after sending pics and messages,1
21,275,grubhub,302920553,2022-11-01 14:01:24,Worst Food Delivery App,they need serious work on customer service and driver issues before i will ever use them again,1
22,276,grubhub,302920553,2022-11-17 07:41:50,Edited delivery address ended up paying for multiple orders,app problem 1 was that the app showed wrong delivery address type homebusiness,3

22,281,grubhub,302920553,2022-11-17 07:41:50,Edited delivery address ended up paying for multiple orders,app problem 2 was that every address edit was interpreted as a new order,3

22,284,grubhub,302920553,2022-11-17 07:41:50,Edited delivery address ended up paying for multiple orders,restaurant problem 3 was that they ignored the fact that they received 3 exactly the same orders from the same person to the same delivery location within 2 minutes or sogrubhub support problem 1 is that they are bot customer satisfaction oriented,3
22,285,grubhub,302920553,2022-11-17 07:41:50,Edited delivery address ended up paying for multiple orders,they do not have this predefined business instinct or making it right for the customer,3

25,315,grubhub,302920553,2022-11-04 22:13:59,Worse than Doordash,so just had a conversation with customer support i was waiting for my order and it said it would arrive at x time so i waited and noticed that the driver was at one point just driving in circles near but about 5 blocks from my location so i thought ok here we go again gps is going to screw things up i message the driver no response i call the driver still no response,1
25,316,grubhub,302920553,2022-11-04 22:13:59,Worse than Doordash,now i am worried so i contact grub hub customer service and ask them to check up on the driver because i am think maybe they got into an accident or something they are in the middle of the street and have not moved their gps location in about 10 mins,1
25,317,grubhub,302920553,2022-11-04 22:13:59,Worse than Doordash,well it turns out the gps was just freaking out and the driver was picking up an order for someone else and was waiting for almost 30 mins to pick it up when they could have delivered my food and then gone back,1
25,318,grubhub,302920553,2022-11-04 22:13:59,Worse than Doordash,i am sorry but what kind of backwards algorithm are you folks in grub hub using to determine deliveries,1

29,370,grubhub,302920553,2022-11-03 23:11:59,Grubhub is Awesome!,these folks have never let me down,5
29,371,grubhub,302920553,2022-11-03 23:11:59,Grubhub is Awesome!,steak out has actually hung up on me when i called during the week,5
29,372,grubhub,302920553,2022-11-03 23:11:59,Grubhub is Awesome!,not just once or twice  consistently,5
29,373,grubhub,302920553,2022-11-03 23:11:59,Grubhub is Awesome!,the weekend crew is great,5
29,374,grubhub,302920553,2022-11-03 23:11:59,Grubhub is Awesome!,however grubhub has never disappointed me no matter what day it is,5
29,375,grubhub,302920553,2022-11-03 23:11:59,Grubhub is Awesome!,steak out just loses my business on hang up days,5
29,376,grubhub,302920553,2022-11-03 23:11:59,Grubhub is Awesome!,and grubhub comes through,5
30,378,grubhub,302920553,2022-11-03 20:19:48,Just terrible overall,i have been using grub hub for about an year now and the amount of time my foods been stolen is ridiculous and when you do talk to customer support they think everybody is a child sounds like they are talking down to you then all they do you return your money when food is stolen but not like it will not happen again but yep let me keep throwing my money at an delivery app that takes hours sometimes to deliver due to the fact how lazy there drivers are then you do meet some drivers that are nice and good at what they are doing but i only met 3 in the past year of me using it such a bad experience and customer support does not help this clause at all could at least give me a discount for the next food order after my food been stolen but nope and then get hanged up on twice by not only my driver but also the customer service love to see it and how i do much regret spending even one cent on this garbage app and service,1
31,379,grubhub,302920553,2022-11-06 19:10:23,"Good app, but the drivers are unpredictable",there is nothing wrong with the app itself,4
31,380,grubhub,302920553,2022-11-06 19:10:23,"Good app, but the drivers are unpredictable",i find it very easy to use and it has many features that improve quality of life such as express reordering and multiple methods of paymentcustomer service i have found to be divisive among people who use this app,4
31,381,grubhub,302920553,2022-11-06 19:10:23,"Good app, but the drivers are unpredictable",i personally have had nothing but good experiences,4
31,382,grubhub,302920553,2022-11-06 19:10:23,"Good app, but the drivers are unpredictable",the representatives were kind helpful and able to resolve my issues quickly,4
31,383,grubhub,302920553,2022-11-06 19:10:23,"Good app, but the drivers are unpredictable",hopefully you have the same carebut those issues all stemmed from one thing the drivers,4
31,384,grubhub,302920553,2022-11-06 19:10:23,"Good app, but the drivers are unpredictable",i understand how busy they can be and how undertipped they are,4
31,385,grubhub,302920553,2022-11-06 19:10:23,"Good app, but the drivers are unpredictable",but sometimes they cannot seem to follow simple instructions,4
31,386,grubhub,302920553,2022-11-06 19:10:23,"Good app, but the drivers are unpredictable",i have had drivers not show up until 30 minutes after i was notified they would arrive had orders have missing items and some orders were not even delivered to the right address,4
31,387,grubhub,302920553,2022-11-06 19:10:23,"Good app, but the drivers are unpredictable",all i have to say is sometimes it is better to go get the food yourself,4
31,388,grubhub,302920553,2022-11-06 19:10:23,"Good app, but the drivers are unpredictable",understand that you are placing your trust in one person to get your food and bring it to you,4
31,389,grubhub,302920553,2022-11-06 19:10:23,"Good app, but the drivers are unpredictable",sometimes they will fail to even do that,4
31,390,grubhub,302920553,2022-11-06 19:10:23,"Good app, but the drivers are unpredictable",there are lots of amazing grubhub drivers out there trust me but you are likely to have a few bad ones,4
32,391,grubhub,302920553,2022-11-13 00:57:18,Useless,i received a grubhub gift card and tried using it my order was over the amount of the gift card so i added my debit card and paid the remaining balance with no problem,1
32,392,grubhub,302920553,2022-11-13 00:57:18,Useless,my order went through and immediately got cancelled apparently it did not get processed,1
32,393,grubhub,302920553,2022-11-13 00:57:18,Useless,customer service told me they would refund me within 48 hours and here we are 48 hours later with no refund,1
32,394,grubhub,302920553,2022-11-13 00:57:18,Useless,to make matters more frustrating now anytime i try to order something it tells me to enter my credit card venmo or apple pay,1
32,395,grubhub,302920553,2022-11-13 00:57:18,Useless,i have connected my venmo and my apple pay and neither of them will work as payment,1
32,396,grubhub,302920553,2022-11-13 00:57:18,Useless,i have tried my credit card and debit card and it keeps telling me to enter the correct card number despite me doing so atleast 8 different times,1
32,397,grubhub,302920553,2022-11-13 00:57:18,Useless,i am getting fed up to the point of just deleting the app and telling everyone i know to never use grubhub ever,1
32,398,grubhub,302920553,2022-11-13 00:57:18,Useless,uber eats is way better and their fees are cheaper anyways,1
33,399,grubhub,302920553,2022-09-12 02:40:03,Delivery Issues,as a person that works in the kitchen at a restaurant i know first hand that when items are missing it is not a driver issue  it is a restaurant issue,5
33,400,grubhub,302920553,2022-09-12 02:40:03,Delivery Issues,some restaurants  fast food places will close up the bags so the driver do not get access and that is for food safety,5
33,401,grubhub,302920553,2022-09-12 02:40:03,Delivery Issues,if you are missing items from an order call the place you ordered from,5
33,402,grubhub,302920553,2022-09-12 02:40:03,Delivery Issues,they are responsible for getting the order correct not delivery drivers,5
33,403,grubhub,302920553,2022-09-12 02:40:03,Delivery Issues,i am so grateful that we see some of the best drivers who take their job seriously,5
33,404,grubhub,302920553,2022-09-12 02:40:03,Delivery Issues,if they can double check orders they will but ultimately it is the responsibility of the place you ordered from,5
33,405,grubhub,302920553,2022-09-12 02:40:03,Delivery Issues,thank you grubhub for providing a great service,5
34,407,grubhub,302920553,2022-10-28 00:14:25,Horrible customer support,the reason i called customer care was because the driver left my food out on the sidewalk in front of my apartment building and did not bother to call or text through the app just sent a picture of the food on the dirty concrete and dogs use that area to relieve themselves often,1
34,408,grubhub,302920553,2022-10-28 00:14:25,Horrible customer support,i called customer care and the tier one person salim was rude and made me repeat the grievance over and over rather than just giving me to a supervisor as i had asked,1
34,409,grubhub,302920553,2022-10-28 00:14:25,Horrible customer support,my husband had to reiterate the story of the crummy delivery drop off to both salim and his supervisor before we finally got a refund for the inedible food but no additional credits for our trouble,1
34,410,grubhub,302920553,2022-10-28 00:14:25,Horrible customer support,grubhubs customer care system typically allows customers to review their experiences with operators however the supervisor disconnected the call before my husband could do so,1
34,411,grubhub,302920553,2022-10-28 00:14:25,Horrible customer support,thus we are going more public with how terrible this experience was,1
35,412,grubhub,302920553,2022-09-14 00:58:15,Order Not Delivered,i placed an expensive order on grubhub,1
35,413,grubhub,302920553,2022-09-14 00:58:15,Order Not Delivered,the driver never delivered the order to my apartment and order was not at other units or at any of the front doors of the building,1
35,414,grubhub,302920553,2022-09-14 00:58:15,Order Not Delivered,the driver never called or texts,1
35,415,grubhub,302920553,2022-09-14 00:58:15,Order Not Delivered,and after the order claimed delivery there was no option for me to contact the driverthe app does not enable users to write reviews for poor driving service,1
35,416,grubhub,302920553,2022-09-14 00:58:15,Order Not Delivered,therefore it seems if a driver steals food or leaves food in an unsecured area the driver gets away with what was donei did contact customer service and the order was replaced,1
35,417,grubhub,302920553,2022-09-14 00:58:15,Order Not Delivered,however there was no additional compensation for the additional wait time,1
35,418,grubhub,302920553,2022-09-14 00:58:15,Order Not Delivered,after pressing hard with customer service i was finally give a 20 discount on a future order which expires in 1 month  why the expiration,1
35,419,grubhub,302920553,2022-09-14 00:58:15,Order Not Delivered,regardless i am frustrated that the driver is allowed to get away with this and that i have no way of being able to contact the driver to ask where the food iscustomer service ought to be more generous upfront when things like this happen to ensure customers remain loyal to their serviceit was an awful experience,1
35,420,grubhub,302920553,2022-09-14 00:58:15,Order Not Delivered,and my impression of grubhub has significantly reduced,1
35,421,grubhub,302920553,2022-09-14 00:58:15,Order Not Delivered,i hope this review is shared up the chain of command,1
35,422,grubhub,302920553,2022-09-14 00:58:15,Order Not Delivered,things like this need a solution and ought to be better handled so that their reputation is preserved,1
36,423,grubhub,302920553,2022-12-08 23:07:12,Room for improvement.,the map updates very slowly when you are viewing the progress of the driver,3
36,424,grubhub,302920553,2022-12-08 23:07:12,Room for improvement.,i was on the phone with one and trying to direct him and the map was well behind his actual locationgrubhub also fails to create driver profiles that are simple to view and rate like uber does,3
36,425,grubhub,302920553,2022-12-08 23:07:12,Room for improvement.,with uber you can click on the driver profile and view comments ratings specific qualities and other information,3
36,426,grubhub,302920553,2022-12-08 23:07:12,Room for improvement.,once the order is completed uber has you rate right away to encourage a responseon grubhub there is no such thing,3
36,427,grubhub,302920553,2022-12-08 23:07:12,Room for improvement.,with grubhub you have to go out of your way to do a rating for a driver so the only people who will likely be doing that are ones who have a negative rating to give,3
36,428,grubhub,302920553,2022-12-08 23:07:12,Room for improvement.,i found this out trying to rate my driver for going above and beyond which would have been easy to do with uber but not with grubhub,3
36,429,grubhub,302920553,2022-12-08 23:07:12,Room for improvement.,you cannot clarify any details with your order after the fact or anything else like you can with uberthe search option is clearly incomplete based on the results received depending on how you choose to sort themother than that the food is there and it works the same as any other app,3
37,430,grubhub,302920553,2022-11-03 06:31:28,Worst service ever.,so i order from a place 5 minutes away,1
37,431,grubhub,302920553,2022-11-03 06:31:28,Worst service ever.,the driver is positioned 10 minutes away from me,1
37,432,grubhub,302920553,2022-11-03 06:31:28,Worst service ever.,5 minutes from the restaurant,1
37,433,grubhub,302920553,2022-11-03 06:31:28,Worst service ever.,i called to confirm the food was ready for pick up 20 min after ordering,1
37,434,grubhub,302920553,2022-11-03 06:31:28,Worst service ever.,the driver proceeds to just drive around for whatever reason for 40 min,1
37,435,grubhub,302920553,2022-11-03 06:31:28,Worst service ever.,literally went back and forth to the street the restaurant was on 3 times and never once grabbed my food,1
37,436,grubhub,302920553,2022-11-03 06:31:28,Worst service ever.,now finally after an hour or so i receive my food and it is cold,1
37,437,grubhub,302920553,2022-11-03 06:31:28,Worst service ever.,so i ask for not even a full refund but atleast half my money back cause i am not eating a cold sandwich that should of just came off a press,1
37,438,grubhub,302920553,2022-11-03 06:31:28,Worst service ever.,then you have the nerve to say you can only give me 5 credit back,1
37,439,grubhub,302920553,2022-11-03 06:31:28,Worst service ever.,then the agent helping me proceeds to say he is gonna transfer me to another department and ends the communication and hangs up on me,1
37,440,grubhub,302920553,2022-11-03 06:31:28,Worst service ever.,i hope your company gets shut down,1
37,441,grubhub,302920553,2022-11-03 06:31:28,Worst service ever.,terrible service,1
38,442,grubhub,302920553,2022-11-03 02:17:43,The worst,placed an order and waited 2 and a half hours called the restaurant and was told the food was picked up a while ago i could not reach the driver nor the restaurant couldwhen i chatted with customer service twiceno one could reach the driver or call the restaurant the restaurant blamed grubhub and grubhub blamed the restaurant,1
38,443,grubhub,302920553,2022-11-03 02:17:43,The worst,at this point my food was already cold 25 hours later i asked for a refund and an email to write a complaint but the chat was ended by the representative,1
38,444,grubhub,302920553,2022-11-03 02:17:43,The worst,uber would have never done this,1
38,445,grubhub,302920553,2022-11-03 02:17:43,The worst,the restaurant reported that the driver picked up the order but the driver cancelled it which means he got to enjoy my dinner instead and grubhub still said it was getting delivered,1
38,446,grubhub,302920553,2022-11-03 02:17:43,The worst,as it is now,1
38,447,grubhub,302920553,2022-11-03 02:17:43,The worst,so safe to say someone stole my food a grubhub employee so i will never be trusting this company again,1
38,448,grubhub,302920553,2022-11-03 02:17:43,The worst,no help  no support no nothinghorrible service,1
38,449,grubhub,302920553,2022-11-03 02:17:43,The worst,save yourself the trouble,1
39,450,grubhub,302920553,2022-10-28 18:39:55,Constantly canceling orders,grubhub has canceled 3 of my last 5 orders,1
39,451,grubhub,302920553,2022-10-28 18:39:55,Constantly canceling orders,today i ordered from shake shack and got a text from shake shack that my order was ready,1
39,452,grubhub,302920553,2022-10-28 18:39:55,Constantly canceling orders,i looked in the grubhub app and it did not have a driver assigned to my order,1
39,453,grubhub,302920553,2022-10-28 18:39:55,Constantly canceling orders,i reached out to customer service and the agent ralph after i said that i got the text from shake shack still told me that my order was in the works and they had not assigned a driver as a result,1
39,454,grubhub,302920553,2022-10-28 18:39:55,Constantly canceling orders,i said it was not still in the works because i received the text from shake shack that it was ready,1
39,455,grubhub,302920553,2022-10-28 18:39:55,Constantly canceling orders,as a response he just ignored what i said and repeated that the order was in the works and would arrive in about 40 minutes,1
39,456,grubhub,302920553,2022-10-28 18:39:55,Constantly canceling orders,meaning it would be ice cold,1
39,457,grubhub,302920553,2022-10-28 18:39:55,Constantly canceling orders,then they canceled my order meaning my order is sitting in shake shack being wasted and i do not have time for lunch,1
39,458,grubhub,302920553,2022-10-28 18:39:55,Constantly canceling orders,ever since grubhub bought seamless the service has been atrocious,1
39,459,grubhub,302920553,2022-10-28 18:39:55,Constantly canceling orders,i miss old seamless,1
40,460,grubhub,302920553,2022-10-30 17:08:47,GrubHub does not validate your orders are processed.,grubhub places orders but it does not check the response from the restaurant to see if the order has been received and will be processed successfully,2
40,461,grubhub,302920553,2022-10-30 17:08:47,GrubHub does not validate your orders are processed.,they only time they confirm is when the driver arrives at the restaurant and reports a problem with the restaurant,2
40,462,grubhub,302920553,2022-10-30 17:08:47,GrubHub does not validate your orders are processed.,on two separate occasions i tried placing order to a local cafe that google maps shows is openon both occasions grubhub falsely reported that my order was complete and it was on its way,2
40,463,grubhub,302920553,2022-10-30 17:08:47,GrubHub does not validate your orders are processed.,on both occasions 10 minutes before my food was supposed to arrive i received an alert that my order was canceled and i would receive a refundi got no further communication the first time this happened,2
40,464,grubhub,302920553,2022-10-30 17:08:47,GrubHub does not validate your orders are processed.,however i got a phone call the second time,2
40,465,grubhub,302920553,2022-10-30 17:08:47,GrubHub does not validate your orders are processed.,i asked grubhub why did they wait until my food was supposed to arrive to tell me there was a problem,2
40,466,grubhub,302920553,2022-10-30 17:08:47,GrubHub does not validate your orders are processed.,the rep then shared that grubhub does not know there is a problem with the orderrestaurant until the driver arrives to pickup the order,2
40,467,grubhub,302920553,2022-10-30 17:08:47,GrubHub does not validate your orders are processed.,it is beyond ridiculous to expect customers to find it acceptable that grubhub does not do a verification via api that the order is being processed,2
40,468,grubhub,302920553,2022-10-30 17:08:47,GrubHub does not validate your orders are processed.,do the product managers pay attention to the customer experience,2
41,470,grubhub,302920553,2022-11-04 22:52:59,Delivery drivers are horrible,placed an order for delivery an hr ahead of time from a fast food restaurant,1
41,471,grubhub,302920553,2022-11-04 22:52:59,Delivery drivers are horrible,driver shows as being at the restaurant then drives to a different location,1
41,472,grubhub,302920553,2022-11-04 22:52:59,Delivery drivers are horrible,i message them and then they cancel the delivery 5 min after i had scheduled the delivery,1
41,473,grubhub,302920553,2022-11-04 22:52:59,Delivery drivers are horrible,i contact customer service they say it will be another hr and give me a 10 perk,1
41,474,grubhub,302920553,2022-11-04 22:52:59,Delivery drivers are horrible,i cancel the order and place a new one,1
41,475,grubhub,302920553,2022-11-04 22:52:59,Delivery drivers are horrible,the new driver delivers the old order that had been sitting for 2 hrs and keeps the fresh order,1
41,476,grubhub,302920553,2022-11-04 22:52:59,Delivery drivers are horrible,i contacted the restaurant to find out if there were two orders so i know there was no reason for the food to be cold,1
41,477,grubhub,302920553,2022-11-04 22:52:59,Delivery drivers are horrible,the order i received had the initial time of the first order i placed,1
41,478,grubhub,302920553,2022-11-04 22:52:59,Delivery drivers are horrible,i contact support again for a full refund cause everything is freezing cold,1
41,479,grubhub,302920553,2022-11-04 22:52:59,Delivery drivers are horrible,instead they give me 5 off my next purchase,1
41,480,grubhub,302920553,2022-11-04 22:52:59,Delivery drivers are horrible,deleting my account and the app,1
42,481,grubhub,302920553,2022-12-06 10:08:13,Better than Doordash,so i have always used different delivery services and grubhub always hits the right spot,5
42,482,grubhub,302920553,2022-12-06 10:08:13,Better than Doordash,i am so disappointed to see a lot of bad reviews on grubhub because there is a lot of better support on grubhub vs doordash and grubhub is an ethical service,5
42,483,grubhub,302920553,2022-12-06 10:08:13,Better than Doordash,my guess is on the app store doordash dominates grubhub unfairly,5
42,484,grubhub,302920553,2022-12-06 10:08:13,Better than Doordash,if you actually compare the prices from doordash and grubhub disregarding the prices doordash charges a lot more,5
42,485,grubhub,302920553,2022-12-06 10:08:13,Better than Doordash,and lastly grubhub takes long but somehow the food is always still magically warm,5
42,486,grubhub,302920553,2022-12-06 10:08:13,Better than Doordash,compared to most delivery services,5
42,487,grubhub,302920553,2022-12-06 10:08:13,Better than Doordash,as a customer i hope that grubhub get the recognition it deserves and does not change,5
43,488,grubhub,302920553,2022-11-29 13:06:36,The drivers on this app take the foods hostage,my delivery driver contacted me and told me if you want your food come outside of building complex then he suddenly left when he was in front of the gate and said he thought his gas is low and cannot make it to fourth floor and when i told him i gonna report it he said i gonna tell grub hun you do not want your food,1
43,489,grubhub,302920553,2022-11-29 13:06:36,The drivers on this app take the foods hostage,extremely experience  then i contacted customer service the customer service said you want refund or your food i never seen such an experience with uber eats or favorthese all happened while i have already left same instruction that all other delivery app easily delivered the food and the customer service ended the chat too soon before i can say my request completely these all happened while my order was expensive and i left a good tip,1
44,491,grubhub,302920553,2022-10-23 21:42:59,No Control,grubhub has no control over your order,2
44,492,grubhub,302920553,2022-10-23 21:42:59,No Control,they are just there to take a fee,2
44,493,grubhub,302920553,2022-10-23 21:42:59,No Control,customer service is very polite but useless,2
44,494,grubhub,302920553,2022-10-23 21:42:59,No Control,once you place an order you have to hope for the best,2
44,495,grubhub,302920553,2022-10-23 21:42:59,No Control,maybe it will be there on time maybe it will be an hour late,2
44,496,grubhub,302920553,2022-10-23 21:42:59,No Control,maybe your courier will pick up your order when it is ready or take a nap grab some lunch take a few trips via some ride app or just sit at home watching tv and cancel 45 minutes after your food was ready,2
44,497,grubhub,302920553,2022-10-23 21:42:59,No Control,you cannot blame the restaurant cannot switch drivers even if they are not moving for 30 minutes and you cannot edit a tip,2
44,498,grubhub,302920553,2022-10-23 21:42:59,No Control,even if you could edit the tip the person who made you wait an extra hour canceled so you would be punishing an innocent courier,2
45,499,grubhub,302920553,2022-09-16 05:43:19,Terrible,i have tried multiple times with this company,1
45,500,grubhub,302920553,2022-09-16 05:43:19,Terrible,so many times they string you along with an order and tell you someone is on their way when in truth there is no one coming and the order is not on its way,1
45,501,grubhub,302920553,2022-09-16 05:43:19,Terrible,and nearly all of not all orders that do make it have issues,1
45,502,grubhub,302920553,2022-09-16 05:43:19,Terrible,this is the worst in my experience of any of the delivery apps,1
45,503,grubhub,302920553,2022-09-16 05:43:19,Terrible,and barring the bezos investment i fully expect this company to fail,1
45,504,grubhub,302920553,2022-09-16 05:43:19,Terrible,the product and service is terrible,1
45,505,grubhub,302920553,2022-09-16 05:43:19,Terrible,the customer service is terrible,1
45,506,grubhub,302920553,2022-09-16 05:43:19,Terrible,and i do not need to sell it any harder than that,1
45,507,grubhub,302920553,2022-09-16 05:43:19,Terrible,as soon as anyone uses it they will realize how bad it is and be sad about the fact they have downloaded it at all,1
45,508,grubhub,302920553,2022-09-16 05:43:19,Terrible,jeff wish you would have brought us something but this company is terrible,1
45,509,grubhub,302920553,2022-09-16 05:43:19,Terrible,its customer service is terrible and it is a drag on your brand,1
46,510,grubhub,302920553,2022-10-16 21:43:17,Worst Customer Service! I've canceled my subscription,after several mishaps and simply just getting my money back each time after not receiving food or waiting hours for it i am done,1
46,511,grubhub,302920553,2022-10-16 21:43:17,Worst Customer Service! I've canceled my subscription,the final straw was getting the wrong food from a different restaurant that contained food i am allergic to and having bryon tell me i will get my money back within 35 business days,1
46,512,grubhub,302920553,2022-10-16 21:43:17,Worst Customer Service! I've canceled my subscription,nothing for my time,1

47,517,grubhub,302920553,2022-12-02 19:46:47,DONT WAST UR MONEY NOR TIME ON THIS APP!!!,had to make a second account to order food because my account that i only had access to was disabled because they felt like it just for them to do it a second time,1
47,518,grubhub,302920553,2022-12-02 19:46:47,DONT WAST UR MONEY NOR TIME ON THIS APP!!!,when i reach out for assistance i get a sorry there is nothing we can for you besides give you the run around and make you wait for a response from a special department that has no name that will never be received as i am still waiting for the response from my first account which was stated to be sent within 48 hours from the time grubhub decided to disable my account that was about a month ago,1
47,519,grubhub,302920553,2022-12-02 19:46:47,DONT WAST UR MONEY NOR TIME ON THIS APP!!!,this app is not worth time time,1

48,523,grubhub,302920553,2022-10-17 18:55:08,Lack of Online Coupon Acceptance,subway does this because it has franchises as individual owners and screws the bottom line but arbys could easily get a boost in business if they put qr codes on their coupons,1
48,524,grubhub,302920553,2022-10-17 18:55:08,Lack of Online Coupon Acceptance,sure they lose out on a dollar or something for every one but corporations can easily afford to do this,1
48,525,grubhub,302920553,2022-10-17 18:55:08,Lack of Online Coupon Acceptance,people do not have cars and when the weather gets rough for people who bike from place to place things can get out of hand,1
48,526,grubhub,302920553,2022-10-17 18:55:08,Lack of Online Coupon Acceptance,plus it gives the coupons people usually throw away a solid use while also giving people a means to get their moneys worthif college students get a ton of these in their mail every week then why not make them worth the gas paper and landfill waste,1
48,527,grubhub,302920553,2022-10-17 18:55:08,Lack of Online Coupon Acceptance,arbys can do better here and it had be great to see that happen,1
49,528,grubhub,302920553,2022-09-19 02:35:45,App works. But service is terrible.,i tried grub hub plus,1

49,533,grubhub,302920553,2022-09-19 02:35:45,App works. But service is terrible.,missing items,1
49,534,grubhub,302920553,2022-09-19 02:35:45,App works. But service is terrible.,incorrect burgers wrong condiments,1
49,535,grubhub,302920553,2022-09-19 02:35:45,App works. But service is terrible.,the only thing they got right was the beverage and sides,1
49,536,grubhub,302920553,2022-09-19 02:35:45,App works. But service is terrible.,the third order when the food arrived it was from a completely different restaurant that we ordered from,1
49,537,grubhub,302920553,2022-09-19 02:35:45,App works. But service is terrible.,we gave the food back to the driver because it was not our food,1
49,538,grubhub,302920553,2022-09-19 02:35:45,App works. But service is terrible.,when we contact grub hub they said the have to do research on our order and can take up to 10 days,1
49,539,grubhub,302920553,2022-09-19 02:35:45,App works. But service is terrible.,they are holding my money with food that was not even delivered,1

49,541,grubhub,302920553,2022-09-19 02:35:45,App works. But service is terrible.,do yourself a favor and do not order from grub hub,1
50,542,grubhub,302920553,2022-10-02 01:31:08,timeframe and cancelations,honestly  not the best when it comes to order updates and if ordered 2 places to be delivered same time  dinner and desert for example the order get assigned to diff people or the same driver goes back and forth needlessly   not good for the drivers,2
50,543,grubhub,302920553,2022-10-02 01:31:08,timeframe and cancelations,as well as half my orders have been canceled with no reason fraking listed,2
50,544,grubhub,302920553,2022-10-02 01:31:08,timeframe and cancelations,like how door dash if out of the one item from wendys they just cancel full thing but at least they listed the reason while they were stil in business  otherwise when grub hub does work  food always still hot when finally does arrive and the drivers are very awesome for doing what they do,2
50,545,grubhub,302920553,2022-10-02 01:31:08,timeframe and cancelations,hence why system should check in on a few details of operation,2
51,546,grubhub,302920553,2022-12-10 05:11:49,App is so frustrating,any app that forces you to go through their crazy menu drilldown for support instead of just having a support email is super shadyafter my order was completely messed up i went through grubhubs predetermined flow in their app and i got a 1 cent refund,1
51,547,grubhub,302920553,2022-12-10 05:11:49,App is so frustrating,1 that is a total bull refund amount,1
51,548,grubhub,302920553,2022-12-10 05:11:49,App is so frustrating,hoping your customers will not notice,1
51,549,grubhub,302920553,2022-12-10 05:11:49,App is so frustrating,2 it took me way too long to even find out where i could talk to a real human,1
51,550,grubhub,302920553,2022-12-10 05:11:49,App is so frustrating,hoping that a hardtofind option of real support means grubhub is hoping that people will just give up when they need help instead of fixing their crappy policies,1
51,551,grubhub,302920553,2022-12-10 05:11:49,App is so frustrating,3 the human i actually chatted with was incredibly helpful and solved my issue in less than a minute,1
51,552,grubhub,302920553,2022-12-10 05:11:49,App is so frustrating,they asked for me to rate them and i gladly wanted to rate them well,1
51,553,grubhub,302920553,2022-12-10 05:11:49,App is so frustrating,the option came up as good  or bad  but this app is so bad i could not even click the button to rate themthe only reason i am even leaving this review is that there are zero options to report a bug directly to grubhub,1
51,554,grubhub,302920553,2022-12-10 05:11:49,App is so frustrating,such a waste of time,1
51,555,grubhub,302920553,2022-12-10 05:11:49,App is so frustrating,my orders are constantly messed up and there is no recourse,1
51,556,grubhub,302920553,2022-12-10 05:11:49,App is so frustrating,i am just going to call restaurants directly from now on,1
52,557,grubhub,302920553,2022-11-17 09:17:51,"Terrible customer service, doesnt even work.",waited over almost an hour for my food saw it was delayed and got a feeling something was wrong as my food apparently hadnt even begun to be prepared,1
52,558,grubhub,302920553,2022-11-17 09:17:51,"Terrible customer service, doesnt even work.",went to cancel my order and instead of simply letting me cancel my order they made me text with a customer service representative who i am quite certain was not even a real person,1
52,559,grubhub,302920553,2022-11-17 09:17:51,"Terrible customer service, doesnt even work.",found out my order had been rejected and i probably wouldnt have even known this unless i cancelled it,1
52,560,grubhub,302920553,2022-11-17 09:17:51,"Terrible customer service, doesnt even work.",the only other time ive tried to use this app was months ago in july of last year and the same thing happened,1
52,561,grubhub,302920553,2022-11-17 09:17:51,"Terrible customer service, doesnt even work.",do not touch this with a ten foot pole and im sure im going to get a robotic response to this review begging me to change my rating like everyone else who gave a bad review,1
53,562,grubhub,302920553,2022-12-16 01:48:12,Horrid customer service,zero stars,1
53,563,grubhub,302920553,2022-12-16 01:48:12,Horrid customer service,i just finally deleted my account after multiple terrible experiences with botched deliveries and uncaring customer service agents,1
53,564,grubhub,302920553,2022-12-16 01:48:12,Horrid customer service,this last time was similar to the previous  i literally waited for an hour and a half got a message that my delivery was complete nope no food here,1
53,565,grubhub,302920553,2022-12-16 01:48:12,Horrid customer service,and the only response was would you like a redelivery in an estimated 50 minutes,1
53,566,grubhub,302920553,2022-12-16 01:48:12,Horrid customer service,no i absolutely would not like to wait almost another hour for your incompetent delivery service,1
53,567,grubhub,302920553,2022-12-16 01:48:12,Horrid customer service,also the word redelivery implies there first was an original delivery which was not the case,1
53,568,grubhub,302920553,2022-12-16 01:48:12,Horrid customer service,the chat agent never offered a sincere apology or any kind of redeeming gesture,1
53,569,grubhub,302920553,2022-12-16 01:48:12,Horrid customer service,then i got an email for a 10 credit for the next time i make an order,1
53,570,grubhub,302920553,2022-12-16 01:48:12,Horrid customer service,lol 10,1
53,572,grubhub,302920553,2022-12-16 01:48:12,Horrid customer service,done with grubhub,1
54,573,grubhub,302920553,2022-11-09 23:38:18,Rude Calling Staff & Bad Canceling System,i take orders that are called into our business and no one has ever told me i am bad at what i do,1
54,574,grubhub,302920553,2022-11-09 23:38:18,Rude Calling Staff & Bad Canceling System,however the person taking the order just today had a mild accent so i had to ask if she could repeat a particular item,1
54,575,grubhub,302920553,2022-11-09 23:38:18,Rude Calling Staff & Bad Canceling System,why are not you familiar with the menu the lady replies in a harsh manner,1
54,576,grubhub,302920553,2022-11-09 23:38:18,Rude Calling Staff & Bad Canceling System,i once expressed regret to her for not hearing what she had to say,1
54,577,grubhub,302920553,2022-11-09 23:38:18,Rude Calling Staff & Bad Canceling System,instead of politely repeating the phrase back this woman continues to blast the phrase at me,1
54,578,grubhub,302920553,2022-11-09 23:38:18,Rude Calling Staff & Bad Canceling System,additionally even if it does not concern me every time someone cancels an order on grubhub the business does not opt to at the very least phone the restaurant to inform them that the order has been canceled,1
54,579,grubhub,302920553,2022-11-09 23:38:18,Rude Calling Staff & Bad Canceling System,as a result the restaurant wastes food as well as time and money,1
54,580,grubhub,302920553,2022-11-09 23:38:18,Rude Calling Staff & Bad Canceling System,i anticipate more from a firm that size,1

55,582,grubhub,302920553,2022-10-06 14:12:41,Customer Service is Non-Existent,if your order is wrong it just refunds the cost of the item that is wrong,3
55,583,grubhub,302920553,2022-10-06 14:12:41,Customer Service is Non-Existent,you have to hunt for the chat option and they cannot do anything but recite what the gh membership includes,3

55,585,grubhub,302920553,2022-10-06 14:12:41,Customer Service is Non-Existent,what about the service fees,3
55,586,grubhub,302920553,2022-10-06 14:12:41,Customer Service is Non-Existent,i just spent 20 on food that i cannot eat and had to give to a coworker because it was incorrectly made and i have dietary restrictions,3
55,587,grubhub,302920553,2022-10-06 14:12:41,Customer Service is Non-Existent,but i got 8 back so apparently that is fair,3
55,588,grubhub,302920553,2022-10-06 14:12:41,Customer Service is Non-Existent,this is where there is a monumental difference between gh and doordash,3

56,591,grubhub,302920553,2022-10-16 04:28:47,BAD,it has passed an hour and some minutes since i ordered and i called the cookie place i ordered from and they said they could not do anything so i called the customer service number and it took so long for the lady to give me my money back,1
56,592,grubhub,302920553,2022-10-16 04:28:47,BAD,the next day we went outside and the cookies were on the ground,1
56,593,grubhub,302920553,2022-10-16 04:28:47,BAD,mind you i kept going outside to check to see if they were there,1
56,594,grubhub,302920553,2022-10-16 04:28:47,BAD,when the cookies got there the delivery guy could have at least knocked on the door but instead they decided to come at like 300 in the morning and sit them by the door,1
56,595,grubhub,302920553,2022-10-16 04:28:47,BAD,i was up all night so i could have gone down there to get them,1
56,596,grubhub,302920553,2022-10-16 04:28:47,BAD,they have terrible customer service,1

57,599,grubhub,302920553,2022-10-14 22:11:15,"Terrible, terrible customer service",the latest fiasco they blocked me from ordering using my credit card but were perfectly fine taking my money from the same credit card for grubhub,1
57,600,grubhub,302920553,2022-10-14 22:11:15,"Terrible, terrible customer service",all this after blocking my account bc i tried ordering food for my parents who were out of town,1
57,601,grubhub,302920553,2022-10-14 22:11:15,"Terrible, terrible customer service",after contacting customer service 5 days in a row trying to regain my account i got no answers just empty promises that another team was working on it,1
57,602,grubhub,302920553,2022-10-14 22:11:15,"Terrible, terrible customer service",i am frankly done with grubhub,1

58,604,grubhub,302920553,2022-10-09 20:07:51,Grubhub payment problem,there is this issue with my account where i will pay for grubhub  and when i try to place an order my account says i have no grubhub plus membership essentially just stealing my money,1
58,605,grubhub,302920553,2022-10-09 20:07:51,Grubhub payment problem,when i contact customer service regarding the issue they say they have no record of me being a grubhub  member but can refund me the charge,1
58,606,grubhub,302920553,2022-10-09 20:07:51,Grubhub payment problem,how does that make sense,1
58,607,grubhub,302920553,2022-10-09 20:07:51,Grubhub payment problem,there is clearly a charge for the amount of the membership and yet they say they do not know anything about it,1
58,608,grubhub,302920553,2022-10-09 20:07:51,Grubhub payment problem,not only that but whenever i try to place an order without the membership it gets immediately cancelled,1
58,609,grubhub,302920553,2022-10-09 20:07:51,Grubhub payment problem,i have also contacted them about the issue but they say it must be a glitch,1
58,610,grubhub,302920553,2022-10-09 20:07:51,Grubhub payment problem,they give me no solution,1
58,611,grubhub,302920553,2022-10-09 20:07:51,Grubhub payment problem,i have switched to doordash since then,1
59,612,grubhub,302920553,2022-09-20 23:21:31,Please add a major necessity,awhile ago i ordered food and i was honestly so hungry that i did not even pay attention to the tip amount,3
59,613,grubhub,302920553,2022-09-20 23:21:31,Please add a major necessity,i felt terrible tipping only 1 and went to change it once i noticed but was unable to,3
59,614,grubhub,302920553,2022-09-20 23:21:31,Please add a major necessity,i would have given a cash tip but i did not have cash on hand so unfortunately the driver got only 1,3
59,615,grubhub,302920553,2022-09-20 23:21:31,Please add a major necessity,please this should not be a thing and i feel like you guys are kind of punishing the drivers for my own incompetence in a way,3
59,616,grubhub,302920553,2022-09-20 23:21:31,Please add a major necessity,will change to 5 stars once it is added,3
59,617,grubhub,302920553,2022-09-20 23:21:31,Please add a major necessity,it does not hurt you in any way and benefits your drivers more than anyone,3

60,620,grubhub,302920553,2022-12-13 20:46:47,Convenience/ customer service,the reason being that i could not order from a restaurant i ordered from last night because my credit card was put on hold for 48 hours,2
60,622,grubhub,302920553,2022-12-13 20:46:47,Convenience/ customer service,plenty of  therecustomer service says for my protection,2

60,624,grubhub,302920553,2022-12-13 20:46:47,Convenience/ customer service,well that does not do me any good  now,2
60,625,grubhub,302920553,2022-12-13 20:46:47,Convenience/ customer service,the other weird thing is i could order if i was picking up or wanted my food asapi called customer support and they were more than happy to cancel my membership instead of helping me solve the problem,2
61,626,grubhub,302920553,2022-11-09 23:49:23,No customer service,if you are a restaurant do not if you are a consumer there are others seamless is not the one,5

62,641,grubhub,302920553,2022-11-19 16:51:33,"Long delivery times, cold food.",i used doordash for a couple years and just canceled because i was bored of the same restaurants their drivers suddenly started delivering my food to the wrong house and i had to reorder and hope they got it righti switched to grubhub and at first i loved it,2
62,642,grubhub,302920553,2022-11-19 16:51:33,"Long delivery times, cold food.",the problem is if you order something far it comes faster than if you want something from a spot close by,2
62,643,grubhub,302920553,2022-11-19 16:51:33,"Long delivery times, cold food.",i ordered from a mcdonalds thats 5 min away and its been over an hour,2
62,644,grubhub,302920553,2022-11-19 16:51:33,"Long delivery times, cold food.",the driver picked my food up but has been doing other deliveries,2
62,645,grubhub,302920553,2022-11-19 16:51:33,"Long delivery times, cold food.",now my food will be cold and at this point id rather have loaded my newborn up in the car to just drive down there so i can have a warm meal,2
63,646,grubhub,302920553,2022-11-16 14:45:42,Drivers lose their tips,yesterday i had ordered dairy queen and additional toast but when it got here it wasnt toasted and was just soggy warm bread,1
63,647,grubhub,302920553,2022-11-16 14:45:42,Drivers lose their tips,the driver was amazing and even made it inside to put the food by my door rather than just outside so i gave them an additional tip,1
63,648,grubhub,302920553,2022-11-16 14:45:42,Drivers lose their tips,afterwards i made a claim with the toast and they refunded me everything,1
63,649,grubhub,302920553,2022-11-16 14:45:42,Drivers lose their tips,tip included with no warning,1
63,650,grubhub,302920553,2022-11-16 14:45:42,Drivers lose their tips,i told them that had they told me the driver tip would have refunded i would have opted out of the refundthey gave no warning and when i asked if there was no way around that i get told they make salary anyway,1
63,651,grubhub,302920553,2022-11-16 14:45:42,Drivers lose their tips,tips can be everything to a driver and it was such a negative interaction that i wont be using the service again,1
63,652,grubhub,302920553,2022-11-16 14:45:42,Drivers lose their tips,treat your drivers better grubhub and any 3rd party delivery service,1
64,653,grubhub,302920553,2022-11-03 14:08:17,A mess,grub hub used to be my go to,1
64,654,grubhub,302920553,2022-11-03 14:08:17,A mess,however why do you allow drivers to pickup multiple orders in various places,1
64,655,grubhub,302920553,2022-11-03 14:08:17,A mess,that defeats the purpose of arrival times,1
64,656,grubhub,302920553,2022-11-03 14:08:17,A mess,lately i have been getting drivers getting my order picking up my food and then are all over town in the opposite direction of my location,1
64,657,grubhub,302920553,2022-11-03 14:08:17,A mess,arrival times get changed about 3 times,1
64,658,grubhub,302920553,2022-11-03 14:08:17,A mess,then my foods cold and gross,1
64,659,grubhub,302920553,2022-11-03 14:08:17,A mess,i understand i can go to the restaurant and pick it up myself but grub hub if your offering a service and i am paying for it then do what you say your business does,1
64,660,grubhub,302920553,2022-11-03 14:08:17,A mess,also customer service is like talking to a wall,1
64,661,grubhub,302920553,2022-11-03 14:08:17,A mess,they just wave a 5 coupon to make you basically deal with whatever problem you have,1
64,662,grubhub,302920553,2022-11-03 14:08:17,A mess,they do not even try to help,1
64,663,grubhub,302920553,2022-11-03 14:08:17,A mess,grub hub has gone downhill big time,1
65,664,grubhub,302920553,2022-11-28 15:50:26,Cant change payment methods,i use grubhub through my universitys meal plan and it is been working fine up until yesterday,3
65,665,grubhub,302920553,2022-11-28 15:50:26,Cant change payment methods,now i cannot change the payment method between using meal swipes to using regular dining money,3
65,666,grubhub,302920553,2022-11-28 15:50:26,Cant change payment methods,each time i click it the options to change pop up for less than 1 second before going away and remaining at the selection i had before which i do not want,3
65,667,grubhub,302920553,2022-11-28 15:50:26,Cant change payment methods,it is making it very hard to get food as many dining locations order through grubhub only,3
65,668,grubhub,302920553,2022-11-28 15:50:26,Cant change payment methods,i think this may be because of the bug update from 6 days ago but it is made my experience worse,3
66,669,grubhub,302920553,2022-12-18 02:05:00,terrible customer service,ordered from a restaurant that is ten minutes away from my house and it took over an hour to get to my destination,1
66,670,grubhub,302920553,2022-12-18 02:05:00,terrible customer service,while this place is popular in my area there is no reason as to why our driver took over thirty minutes to get to the restaurant and take over forty minutes to drive to my place,1
66,671,grubhub,302920553,2022-12-18 02:05:00,terrible customer service,we attempted to reach out to the driver only to be met with an answering machine why even have the option if it does not work,1
66,672,grubhub,302920553,2022-12-18 02:05:00,terrible customer service,finally got our food and it was cold,1
66,673,grubhub,302920553,2022-12-18 02:05:00,terrible customer service,tried talking to customer service and they only offered 5 credit for a 50 meal per a dumb policy that does not put the customers needs as a priority,1
66,674,grubhub,302920553,2022-12-18 02:05:00,terrible customer service,absolutely ridiculous,1

68,680,grubhub,302920553,2022-11-22 17:26:18,Nothing like paying TWICE for nothing.,so i tried again and the order was immediately cancelled a second time but they took the 77 out of my paypal again,1
68,681,grubhub,302920553,2022-11-22 17:26:18,Nothing like paying TWICE for nothing.,that is 154 tied up for over a week,1

69,689,grubhub,302920553,2022-10-13 18:39:26,A food delivery App,tip appropriately as you realize you could have driven the extra 30 minutes in traffic to and from the place of food creation,5
69,690,grubhub,302920553,2022-10-13 18:39:26,A food delivery App,happy grub hubbin,5

70,693,grubhub,302920553,2022-11-18 20:18:26,Officially fed up (but not fed),they just keep the food mark it delivered and drive off,1
70,694,grubhub,302920553,2022-11-18 20:18:26,Officially fed up (but not fed),unlike other delivery apps they are not required to take a picture of proof of delivery,1
70,695,grubhub,302920553,2022-11-18 20:18:26,Officially fed up (but not fed),i will say at least customer support reorders it for me or gives a refund but i am ordering food when i am in a rush with limited time and i do not have time to wait another hour for the reorder,1
70,696,grubhub,302920553,2022-11-18 20:18:26,Officially fed up (but not fed),plus you tip the driver beforehand so these drivers get away with my money and my food,1
70,697,grubhub,302920553,2022-11-18 20:18:26,Officially fed up (but not fed),trust me the way this company operates their business is not worth your time,1

72,704,grubhub,302920553,2022-10-06 01:47:17,Don't expect to get your orders,multiple times in the same week i have had my orders delayed for over 2 hours or never received at all after saying they had been delivered,1
72,705,grubhub,302920553,2022-10-06 01:47:17,Don't expect to get your orders,only after berating the first customer service person and being transferred to a supervisor then threatening to just have your credit card issue a chargeback will you be offered a refund,1
72,706,grubhub,302920553,2022-10-06 01:47:17,Don't expect to get your orders,initially they want to give you coupons for future orders,1
72,707,grubhub,302920553,2022-10-06 01:47:17,Don't expect to get your orders,like who wants to continue to use a service that is unreliable,1
72,708,grubhub,302920553,2022-10-06 01:47:17,Don't expect to get your orders,i would not recommend grubhub to anyone,1
72,709,grubhub,302920553,2022-10-06 01:47:17,Don't expect to get your orders,they cannot even contact their drivers when an issue arises,1
72,710,grubhub,302920553,2022-10-06 01:47:17,Don't expect to get your orders,i have never experienced a more incompetent business and will never use their service again,1
73,711,grubhub,302920553,2022-12-01 01:46:26,A joke of a service,this is somehow the worst delivery and customer service,1
73,712,grubhub,302920553,2022-12-01 01:46:26,A joke of a service,i have had food stolen delivered to the wrong place missing food items customer services not providing solutions and delivery drivers admitting they do not read delivery instructions,1
73,713,grubhub,302920553,2022-12-01 01:46:26,A joke of a service,the final straw was ordering food and then it being delivered almost an hour later where the food was cold and soggy,1
73,714,grubhub,302920553,2022-12-01 01:46:26,A joke of a service,the solution after i had spent almost 30 was a 5 credit to my account,1
73,715,grubhub,302920553,2022-12-01 01:46:26,A joke of a service,i assume people order hot food so they do not have to cook and here you are then having to heat up your food anyway,1
73,716,grubhub,302920553,2022-12-01 01:46:26,A joke of a service,after i use up the joke of a 5 credit that will cover the delivery fee and maybe tax if lucky i will no longer use this service,1
73,717,grubhub,302920553,2022-12-01 01:46:26,A joke of a service,it is a joke,1
74,718,grubhub,302920553,2022-10-01 13:41:04,I have had to cancel two orders this week because of simple and avoidable mistakes,first timei ordered lunch and the driver arrived did not call me delivered the food in my apartment lobby and when i went down to get it nothing was there,1
74,719,grubhub,302920553,2022-10-01 13:41:04,I have had to cancel two orders this week because of simple and avoidable mistakes,there needs to be a better system of communication with the driver and the customer,1
74,720,grubhub,302920553,2022-10-01 13:41:04,I have had to cancel two orders this week because of simple and avoidable mistakes,drivers want to get as many deliveries as they can and so they wont even wait a minute and sometimes it works but sometimes they loose the food,1
74,721,grubhub,302920553,2022-10-01 13:41:04,I have had to cancel two orders this week because of simple and avoidable mistakes,second time i ordered breakfast this morning and when i checked the map my driver was very far from both my home and the restaurant,1
74,722,grubhub,302920553,2022-10-01 13:41:04,I have had to cancel two orders this week because of simple and avoidable mistakes,when i called him he said that the restaurant was closed and he had just kept working,1
74,723,grubhub,302920553,2022-10-01 13:41:04,I have had to cancel two orders this week because of simple and avoidable mistakes,i did not get a notification from him and the app said that the restaurant was open,1
74,724,grubhub,302920553,2022-10-01 13:41:04,I have had to cancel two orders this week because of simple and avoidable mistakes,the app cannot offer food from restaurants that are not open,1
74,725,grubhub,302920553,2022-10-01 13:41:04,I have had to cancel two orders this week because of simple and avoidable mistakes,and if they are closed again there needs to be a better system of communication between the driver and customer so i can know that it was closed instead of just waiting 20 minutes,1
75,726,grubhub,302920553,2022-12-09 00:45:02,Dishonest Drivers,over 5 times i ordered from grubhub the drivers pick up the food and cancel the order when they get close enough to you they actually get to keep your food,5
75,727,grubhub,302920553,2022-12-09 00:45:02,Dishonest Drivers,the other times they delivery driver calls me to drive to them to pick up my food whats the point of the delivery if i have to drove to pick it up,5
75,728,grubhub,302920553,2022-12-09 00:45:02,Dishonest Drivers,worse food delivery service and i will never ever use their service again,5
75,729,grubhub,302920553,2022-12-09 00:45:02,Dishonest Drivers,customer service is no help either,5
76,730,grubhub,302920553,2022-09-22 16:40:29,Terrible service,i put in the delivery instructions for which entrance to where i work at the drivers refused to follow the instructions,1
76,731,grubhub,302920553,2022-09-22 16:40:29,Terrible service,they dropped it off at tool rental or the pro desk sometimes nasty to my co workers before leavingthe final straw for this app i had was that i put my house as the address and the food was delivered to my work instead,1
76,732,grubhub,302920553,2022-09-22 16:40:29,Terrible service,when i contacted the help desk all i was offered as compensation was 60 day free membership for the fact that i had to drive to pick up my food,1
76,733,grubhub,302920553,2022-09-22 16:40:29,Terrible service,when i went into the app the next day there was no member ship and i could not even get in contact with their help,1
76,734,grubhub,302920553,2022-09-22 16:40:29,Terrible service,both grubhub and doordash have messed up too many times to accept paying these exorbitant fees,1
77,735,grubhub,302920553,2022-12-18 23:20:41,Not so great lately,the added cost is getting to be ridiculous,2
77,736,grubhub,302920553,2022-12-18 23:20:41,Not so great lately,even with a subscription i find myself paying an extra 510 not including a tip for the driver which i feel like is the only extra i should really pay,2
77,737,grubhub,302920553,2022-12-18 23:20:41,Not so great lately,i will often order from a location that is a couple miles maybe 3min from my house and often times it will take 12 hours for the items to arrive,2
77,738,grubhub,302920553,2022-12-18 23:20:41,Not so great lately,usually old cold or just missing items,2
77,739,grubhub,302920553,2022-12-18 23:20:41,Not so great lately,i find myself returning of course for the convenience fully expecting a long wait and not so fresh food,2
77,740,grubhub,302920553,2022-12-18 23:20:41,Not so great lately,i try to order accordingly and only order when i really do not want to leave,2
78,741,grubhub,302920553,2022-10-22 11:28:26,Problems with some menu items and high price markup,a software bug prevents us from ordering our favorite dishes through grubhub,2
78,742,grubhub,302920553,2022-10-22 11:28:26,Problems with some menu items and high price markup,at a place near us entrees come with a selection of 2 required sides but when one is selected for each the app says too many items were selected,2
78,743,grubhub,302920553,2022-10-22 11:28:26,Problems with some menu items and high price markup,but since both sides are required selections if we do not pick a side for each entry the button for adding to bag is grayed out and we cannot order the item,2
78,744,grubhub,302920553,2022-10-22 11:28:26,Problems with some menu items and high price markup,this happens for all entrees at roasters in sandy springs and none can be ordered through the app,2
78,745,grubhub,302920553,2022-10-22 11:28:26,Problems with some menu items and high price markup,we have been hoping it would be fixed but it has not yet and it is very frustrating,2
79,746,grubhub,302920553,2022-10-16 00:15:22,Lowest End Delivery App,i use postmares uber eats grubhub and doordash,1
79,747,grubhub,302920553,2022-10-16 00:15:22,Lowest End Delivery App,i pay for premium for all of these services,1
79,748,grubhub,302920553,2022-10-16 00:15:22,Lowest End Delivery App,grubhub is by far the lowest end of them all,1
79,749,grubhub,302920553,2022-10-16 00:15:22,Lowest End Delivery App,out of 10 deliveries 8 of the delivery drivers do not speak english,1
79,750,grubhub,302920553,2022-10-16 00:15:22,Lowest End Delivery App,one of my drivers did not contact me and just marked as delivered and after contacting support they jst refunded my order and expected me to be content with that,1
79,751,grubhub,302920553,2022-10-16 00:15:22,Lowest End Delivery App,grubhub has the lowest standards for their drivers worst app ui and i would happily pay slightly more to use other delivery apps,1
79,752,grubhub,302920553,2022-10-16 00:15:22,Lowest End Delivery App,edit why are you asking me to contact support again,1
79,753,grubhub,302920553,2022-10-16 00:15:22,Lowest End Delivery App,ive already contacted support and tried multiple times after my order to try to get in contact but you guys did nothing so,1
80,756,grubhub,302920553,2022-12-02 00:50:04,Terrible customer service and app does not work,i ordered food and when i went to check the status near the time of my provided delivery window it had said it had been delivered 30 minutes before,1
80,757,grubhub,302920553,2022-12-02 00:50:04,Terrible customer service and app does not work,i checked all around the house and at all the neighbors and nothing,1
80,758,grubhub,302920553,2022-12-02 00:50:04,Terrible customer service and app does not work,i was unable to go back and see my driver or rate them or anything and customer service was not able to give me any information on what happened,1
80,759,grubhub,302920553,2022-12-02 00:50:04,Terrible customer service and app does not work,i did not receive any updates despite having text updates on,1
80,760,grubhub,302920553,2022-12-02 00:50:04,Terrible customer service and app does not work,customer service only offered to reorder my food which also arrived late,1
80,761,grubhub,302920553,2022-12-02 00:50:04,Terrible customer service and app does not work,i will never use grubhub and will also tell anyone who listens to use a different app,1
81,762,grubhub,302920553,2022-12-12 23:11:59,Ordering through GrubHub is expensive but it's guaranteed  if you're not satisfied,grubhub gives you a guarantee that if you are not happy with the food or the food is late or cold you get your money back you refunded it does not really change the fact that when you are hungry you want to have something to write but at least you get a refund so if you are gonna order food i guess it is the best place to use grubhub at your service,5
82,763,grubhub,302920553,2022-12-16 13:31:56,Almost restored confidence?,the last several times i have ordered using grubhub were epic fails,5
82,764,grubhub,302920553,2022-12-16 13:31:56,Almost restored confidence?,this order was super fast and everything was there,5
82,765,grubhub,302920553,2022-12-16 13:31:56,Almost restored confidence?,i have written you guys off so many times and for some reason keep coming back and putting myself through it because at first you guys were so good,5
82,766,grubhub,302920553,2022-12-16 13:31:56,Almost restored confidence?,the girl that did my order yesterday was perfect,5
82,767,grubhub,302920553,2022-12-16 13:31:56,Almost restored confidence?,time will tell for sure but thank the girl that did my order yesterdayshe rocked,5
83,768,grubhub,302920553,2022-10-29 05:43:47,Terrible!,i updated my contact information weeks ago but when the delivery person needed to call me he had my old telephone number,1
83,769,grubhub,302920553,2022-10-29 05:43:47,Terrible!,he gave me a hard time for not updating my contact number,1
83,770,grubhub,302920553,2022-10-29 05:43:47,Terrible!,i checked and my profile was accurate including my new number,1
83,771,grubhub,302920553,2022-10-29 05:43:47,Terrible!,i called the restaurant who advised that my old number came up with my order,1
83,772,grubhub,302920553,2022-10-29 05:43:47,Terrible!,after 20 minutes on chat the grubhubseamless rep told me to update my profile which i explained that i did so weeks ago,1
83,773,grubhub,302920553,2022-10-29 05:43:47,Terrible!,she then accusatorially blamed me because i have had 11 addresses on file,1
83,774,grubhub,302920553,2022-10-29 05:43:47,Terrible!,when i checked that i saw that i have my home work and 2nd job addresses in my profile,1
83,775,grubhub,302920553,2022-10-29 05:43:47,Terrible!,none have the old profile info,1
84,776,grubhub,302920553,2022-09-24 03:16:57,Incompetence & Horrid Customer Service,i had three separate orders to three different places canceled over an hour after i placed the orders after the drivers drove all the way over to pick it up,1
84,777,grubhub,302920553,2022-09-24 03:16:57,Incompetence & Horrid Customer Service,this was in the same night because i kept trying different places,1
84,778,grubhub,302920553,2022-09-24 03:16:57,Incompetence & Horrid Customer Service,restaurants confirm orders and then when the drivers get there they do not have the items that they confirm they have and just cancel the order on you,1
84,779,grubhub,302920553,2022-09-24 03:16:57,Incompetence & Horrid Customer Service,the customer service representatives offer to do nothing to help you and do not care,1
84,780,grubhub,302920553,2022-09-24 03:16:57,Incompetence & Horrid Customer Service,the drivers do not communicate when you reach out to them,1
84,781,grubhub,302920553,2022-09-24 03:16:57,Incompetence & Horrid Customer Service,no one calls to ask about substitutions,1
84,782,grubhub,302920553,2022-09-24 03:16:57,Incompetence & Horrid Customer Service,the whole thing is a waste of time and money,1
85,783,grubhub,302920553,2022-11-26 23:24:11,Irresponsible employer of vicious drivers,recently i placed an order for my elderly mother,1
85,784,grubhub,302920553,2022-11-26 23:24:11,Irresponsible employer of vicious drivers,the driver dropped the food at the house next door the proceeded to curse me out when i asked where she left the food,1
85,785,grubhub,302920553,2022-11-26 23:24:11,Irresponsible employer of vicious drivers,apparently she was too stupid to notice no one lived at the house next door,1
85,786,grubhub,302920553,2022-11-26 23:24:11,Irresponsible employer of vicious drivers,this would not have been a problem except that i live in another state and my mother was unable to walk to the neighbors house on her own,1
85,787,grubhub,302920553,2022-11-26 23:24:11,Irresponsible employer of vicious drivers,grubhub needs to better assess the basic intelligence of their drivers in the suburbs,1
85,788,grubhub,302920553,2022-11-26 23:24:11,Irresponsible employer of vicious drivers,i have never had a problem in the city,1
85,789,grubhub,302920553,2022-11-26 23:24:11,Irresponsible employer of vicious drivers,but the suburban drivers are viscous,1
85,790,grubhub,302920553,2022-11-26 23:24:11,Irresponsible employer of vicious drivers,had to have the order refunded bc grubhub could not guarantee the same moron would not be the driver of the order was redelivered,1
86,791,grubhub,302920553,2022-10-21 03:23:51,Let me use Promo codes,these delivery apps were incredibly convenient creations however it is absolutely ridiculous that they will not let you use promo codes unless you are a brand new customer,2
86,792,grubhub,302920553,2022-10-21 03:23:51,Let me use Promo codes,also why are items on the menu more expensive than the price directly from the store,2
86,793,grubhub,302920553,2022-10-21 03:23:51,Let me use Promo codes,if the price is 30 higher then why is there a delivery fee,2
86,794,grubhub,302920553,2022-10-21 03:23:51,Let me use Promo codes,if someone would just invent a way for me to get items at menu price and only pay a delivery fee you could put these shiesty businesses out of business and collect all the business and money for yourself,2
86,795,grubhub,302920553,2022-10-21 03:23:51,Let me use Promo codes,think about it people,2
87,796,grubhub,302920553,2022-10-02 02:40:40,Disappointing Service,i placed an order at a restaurant more than an hour before they closed and then received a message that my order was being prepared,1
87,797,grubhub,302920553,2022-10-02 02:40:40,Disappointing Service,15 minutes before my order was supposed to be delivered they cancelled my order saying it was because the restaurant was closing,1
87,798,grubhub,302920553,2022-10-02 02:40:40,Disappointing Service,but i sent my order well in advance of them closing and it should have been easy to fulfill my order on time,1
87,799,grubhub,302920553,2022-10-02 02:40:40,Disappointing Service,then they call and say only that i was refunded but there is no recourse for the fact that despite putting in my order early and waiting 45 minutes they did not get there on time to place my order before the restaurants closing,1
88,800,grubhub,302920553,2022-10-20 16:57:08,Drivers frequently game the system,i frequently have issues with drivers being late or abandoning the order,1
88,801,grubhub,302920553,2022-10-20 16:57:08,Drivers frequently game the system,too often you can see that they are making pickups and drop offs for other delivery services before satisfying grubhub orders,1
88,802,grubhub,302920553,2022-10-20 16:57:08,Drivers frequently game the system,they change the delivery time to meet their needs without consideration for the impact upon the food and the customer,1
88,803,grubhub,302920553,2022-10-20 16:57:08,Drivers frequently game the system,they never apologizei get that people are trying to earn a living but delivering cold food that i am having to pay a premium for is very frustrating,1
88,804,grubhub,302920553,2022-10-20 16:57:08,Drivers frequently game the system,take pride in your work or do not do it,1
88,805,grubhub,302920553,2022-10-20 16:57:08,Drivers frequently game the system,a 5 discount for missing the delivery window by an hour just does not bring satisfaction,1
89,806,grubhub,302920553,2022-11-26 21:07:46,They're never going to pick up your food,i work at a cafe and yesterday someone called us to see if we were open because their delivery time kept getting pushed back and i had to tell them the driver just has not shown up yet,5

95,847,grubhub,302920553,2022-09-22 00:21:51,Too many fees,system works great food is always good and the communication of my order status is top notch but there are just way too many fees,4
95,848,grubhub,302920553,2022-09-22 00:21:51,Too many fees,you have to pay a delivery fee a service fee a tip and the price of the food is higher on grubhub than you would pay at the restaurant,4
95,849,grubhub,302920553,2022-09-22 00:21:51,Too many fees,add the monthly fee to that and it is just crazy how much you are paying if you keep track,4
95,850,grubhub,302920553,2022-09-22 00:21:51,Too many fees,we only use grubhub when we cannot go pick up ourselves for some reason,4
96,851,grubhub,302920553,2022-09-16 03:23:39,Terrible customer service,i never had a bad experience until this week,1

96,855,grubhub,302920553,2022-09-16 03:23:39,Terrible customer service,they sent me a 15 coupon that i could only use if i purchased something 15 without taxes and fees,1
96,856,grubhub,302920553,2022-09-16 03:23:39,Terrible customer service,that means i would be paying more money,1
96,857,grubhub,302920553,2022-09-16 03:23:39,Terrible customer service,i talked to another lady to sort it out brittany l and before i could answer she ended the chat on me too,1

96,860,grubhub,302920553,2022-09-16 03:23:39,Terrible customer service,if only i could post the ss,1
97,861,grubhub,302920553,2022-12-09 03:30:17,Outdoor Floors are not for food!,i have had a number of issues with grubhub delivery most recently,3
97,862,grubhub,302920553,2022-12-09 03:30:17,Outdoor Floors are not for food!,the driver will drop the food at the doorstep and walk away,3
97,863,grubhub,302920553,2022-12-09 03:30:17,Outdoor Floors are not for food!,i later sometimes will get a text indicating that the food has been delivered,3
97,864,grubhub,302920553,2022-12-09 03:30:17,Outdoor Floors are not for food!,unfortunately this notification comes to me as late as 20 minutes which means that my food is cold and then two cases raccoons have gotten to it,3
97,865,grubhub,302920553,2022-12-09 03:30:17,Outdoor Floors are not for food!,not appreciating the lack of care these drivers show even though in my delivery instructions i specifically indicate not to put it on the floor,3
98,866,grubhub,302920553,2022-11-12 16:56:23,Horrible lazy drivers! Lazy App design!,i am going to stop using grubhub and go back up uber eats,1
98,867,grubhub,302920553,2022-11-12 16:56:23,Horrible lazy drivers! Lazy App design!,grubhub drivers never follow delivery instructions and yet i have no way to void  remove tips for poor service unless i contact grubhub and spend 30min in queother apps i can add or remove tips after the delivery myself but grubhub automatically gives the tip and makes it hard to remove it making their drivers lazy and feeling entitled to something that is earned through hard work and good servicealso for crying out loud add a option for basement apartment in your address fields,1
98,868,grubhub,302920553,2022-11-12 16:56:23,Horrible lazy drivers! Lazy App design!,using delivery instructions for it when your drivers do not read them or cannot read them is ridiculousand finally vet your drivers,1
98,869,grubhub,302920553,2022-11-12 16:56:23,Horrible lazy drivers! Lazy App design!,half the time my orders are delivered by people who look nothing like the photo picture 20yo white lady  delivered by 50yo hispanic male makes me think grubhub is enabling identify theft or providing means for those ineligible for work in this country to circumvent their illegal status,1
99,870,grubhub,302920553,2022-12-14 01:12:02,Thank you Grubhub 🙏🏻,i am a full time student and single mom and i lost both my parents a long time ago,5

99,873,grubhub,302920553,2022-12-14 01:12:02,Thank you Grubhub 🙏🏻,now i know why my mom never wanted to cook for just her only if i was eating dinner too,5

100,880,grubhub,302920553,2022-10-29 07:39:30,My first review was deleted,i get a credit for the cancellation but it does not compensate for the inconvenience,1
100,881,grubhub,302920553,2022-10-29 07:39:30,My first review was deleted,maybe my first review was too vague so let me clarify you would be better off using a better delivery service or getting it yourself if you are nondisabled,1
100,882,grubhub,302920553,2022-10-29 07:39:30,My first review was deleted,do not waste your time trying to depend on grub hub,1
100,883,grubhub,302920553,2022-10-29 07:39:30,My first review was deleted,my previous review was two stars but i knocked it down an extra star for being inconvenienced again by rewriting my review,1
101,884,grubhub,302920553,2022-09-23 02:57:18,Horrible customer service,i pay 20 a month for free delivery,1
101,885,grubhub,302920553,2022-09-23 02:57:18,Horrible customer service,i tried to order tonight and it says they cannot deliver to me,1
101,886,grubhub,302920553,2022-09-23 02:57:18,Horrible customer service,i tried 3 different restaurants,1
101,887,grubhub,302920553,2022-09-23 02:57:18,Horrible customer service,i called customer service and they told me they could not tell me why i cannot order food,1
101,888,grubhub,302920553,2022-09-23 02:57:18,Horrible customer service,they said i would get an email in 34 days which is obviously no help tonight,1
101,889,grubhub,302920553,2022-09-23 02:57:18,Horrible customer service,my credit card was charged for each of the deliveries they cannot deliver they said i have to also wait 57 days for that to be refunded,1
101,890,grubhub,302920553,2022-09-23 02:57:18,Horrible customer service,i guess this service is okay if you have money to spend on food that will never come and that you have to wait a week to have refunded,1
101,891,grubhub,302920553,2022-09-23 02:57:18,Horrible customer service,not for me,1
102,892,grubhub,302920553,2022-11-06 00:14:36,A price gauging monopoly. very low ethical standards,what grubhub has done has destroyed the restaurant business they have choked restaurants for a high percentage of their profits  they are left with no choice but to work through grubhub to survive  they dont pay their delivery workers enough and instead put the social pressure on the customer to pay the wage of their workers,1
102,893,grubhub,302920553,2022-11-06 00:14:36,A price gauging monopoly. very low ethical standards,a disgusting corporate tactic becoming more and more the norm,1
102,894,grubhub,302920553,2022-11-06 00:14:36,A price gauging monopoly. very low ethical standards,companies like this work because in the beginning everything is so convenient and inexpensive then once they have everyone hooked on their system they raise the service fees they add another hidden fee they rip the rug right out from under you and now were paying 15 in fees before even tipping the only person actually doing the work the driver who makes next to nothing,1
102,895,grubhub,302920553,2022-11-06 00:14:36,A price gauging monopoly. very low ethical standards,i use it now but the moment there is a more ethical and customer friendly company grubhub will never see another dollar from me,1
102,896,grubhub,302920553,2022-11-06 00:14:36,A price gauging monopoly. very low ethical standards,i look forward to it,1
103,897,grubhub,302920553,2022-10-05 22:56:29,Efficient & Professional but pricey,best drivers,4
103,898,grubhub,302920553,2022-10-05 22:56:29,Efficient & Professional but pricey,efficient professional and food comes closed in packaging so it seems safe but the price to order with all the fees adds up quick,4
103,899,grubhub,302920553,2022-10-05 22:56:29,Efficient & Professional but pricey,i only order from 3rd party delivery sites when i am being really lazy or sick or use a place that does not have their own delivery ppl,4
103,900,grubhub,302920553,2022-10-05 22:56:29,Efficient & Professional but pricey,it is an expensive last resort yet reliable,4
103,901,grubhub,302920553,2022-10-05 22:56:29,Efficient & Professional but pricey,way better than doordash drivers who typically just do not care and will argue,4
104,902,grubhub,302920553,2022-12-07 17:30:20,Poor delivery service,my first yesterday experience did not go well at all,3
104,903,grubhub,302920553,2022-12-07 17:30:20,Poor delivery service,took 2 hours for delivery,3
104,904,grubhub,302920553,2022-12-07 17:30:20,Poor delivery service,it appeared the driver was overloaded with deliveries,3
104,905,grubhub,302920553,2022-12-07 17:30:20,Poor delivery service,when driver arrived she refused to bring my order inside,3
104,906,grubhub,302920553,2022-12-07 17:30:20,Poor delivery service,i am in a wheelchair,3
104,907,grubhub,302920553,2022-12-07 17:30:20,Poor delivery service,my oxygen tube will not reach the front door,3
104,908,grubhub,302920553,2022-12-07 17:30:20,Poor delivery service,driver was informed of this before she picked up the order,3
104,909,grubhub,302920553,2022-12-07 17:30:20,Poor delivery service,very disappointing service,3
104,910,grubhub,302920553,2022-12-07 17:30:20,Poor delivery service,i am going to try again today and go from there,3
104,911,grubhub,302920553,2022-12-07 17:30:20,Poor delivery service,hopefully with a different driver,3
104,912,grubhub,302920553,2022-12-07 17:30:20,Poor delivery service,grubhub has a wonderful website and i am looking forward to continued use,3
105,913,grubhub,302920553,2022-12-17 05:02:03,Dual Payment: Corporate Gift Card,i tried to use my corporate gift card along with using my own apple pay card for the additional charges over the amount of the gift card,4
105,914,grubhub,302920553,2022-12-17 05:02:03,Dual Payment: Corporate Gift Card,however i received an error that multiple payment types was not allowed,4
105,915,grubhub,302920553,2022-12-17 05:02:03,Dual Payment: Corporate Gift Card,i was trying to spend an additional 15 the amount of the gift card,4
105,916,grubhub,302920553,2022-12-17 05:02:03,Dual Payment: Corporate Gift Card,is this intentional or a possible bug,4
105,917,grubhub,302920553,2022-12-17 05:02:03,Dual Payment: Corporate Gift Card,otherwise the apps ui is very aesthetic pleasing,4
106,918,grubhub,302920553,2022-10-15 00:17:03,Not what it used to be,deliveries frequently show up long after the estimated delivery time,2
106,919,grubhub,302920553,2022-10-15 00:17:03,Not what it used to be,this usually means an hour or longer after the order was placed,2
106,920,grubhub,302920553,2022-10-15 00:17:03,Not what it used to be,delivery drivers lie about pick up time which is ridiculous because their location is displayed on the app,2
106,921,grubhub,302920553,2022-10-15 00:17:03,Not what it used to be,drivers frequently refuse to get out of their cars to drop off food expecting customers to come to them,2
106,922,grubhub,302920553,2022-10-15 00:17:03,Not what it used to be,why do we even tip for such poor service,2
106,923,grubhub,302920553,2022-10-15 00:17:03,Not what it used to be,why cannot we tip after the food has been delivered,2

126,1051,grubhub,302920553,2022-10-15 19:36:27,If I could give no stars I would,i ordered three items to be delivered between 12401250 and when it is just 10 minutes before it was supposed to be delivered it was delayed and then the driver changed because the restaurant was taking to long then it was further delayed another hour and half,1
126,1052,grubhub,302920553,2022-10-15 19:36:27,If I could give no stars I would,then for the new driver to not even drop the order off in the right area or keep it for themselves all i know this is completely unprofessional and has not been the first time this has happened i do not recommend to anybody,1
127,1053,grubhub,302920553,2022-11-21 23:20:17,No good,the very first time i ordered from grub hub i had an order with 70 dollars worth of food and a good tip,1
127,1054,grubhub,302920553,2022-11-21 23:20:17,No good,it was delivering to a well known business right off the  of the main road,1

128,1059,grubhub,302920553,2022-09-18 17:00:45,No one knows what there doing,this has to be the worst food delivery app every time i order  grub hub will say order is on its way and ten minutes later i am getting a full refund,1
128,1060,grubhub,302920553,2022-09-18 17:00:45,No one knows what there doing,grub hub messages are not in accord  with the restaurant there only guessing,1

141,1126,grubhub,302920553,2022-10-22 17:26:57,They will cancel your grubhub+ membership,tried to order food 3 times from the same restaurant because drivers kept getting lost and cancelling the order,1
141,1127,grubhub,302920553,2022-10-22 17:26:57,They will cancel your grubhub+ membership,apparently when you contact customer service and try to explain the situation they will just cancel your grubhub membership and not tell you,1
141,1128,grubhub,302920553,2022-10-22 17:26:57,They will cancel your grubhub+ membership,then when you find out and call them on it they tell you to check for fraudulent activity and that there is nothing they can do to refund you or reinstate your membership,1
141,1129,grubhub,302920553,2022-10-22 17:26:57,They will cancel your grubhub+ membership,joke of a company and i thought ubereats was bad,1
142,1130,grubhub,302920553,2022-12-17 06:13:08,Glorified Scam,maybe if grubhub wants their orders to be on time they should actually put more of their  into paying their drivers,1
142,1131,grubhub,302920553,2022-12-17 06:13:08,Glorified Scam,so overpriced but the drivers get pennies,1
142,1132,grubhub,302920553,2022-12-17 06:13:08,Glorified Scam,prices on app much higher than real restaurant costs before all the fees are added too,1
142,1133,grubhub,302920553,2022-12-17 06:13:08,Glorified Scam,eta on the app is a joke and it does not update accurately and the app does not consider it an issue when an order is hours late,1
142,1134,grubhub,302920553,2022-12-17 06:13:08,Glorified Scam,restaurant will make your order and it can be waiting there for 2 hrs before someone picks it up,1
142,1135,grubhub,302920553,2022-12-17 06:13:08,Glorified Scam,do you get any refund for this,1
142,1136,grubhub,302920553,2022-12-17 06:13:08,Glorified Scam,no but you get 7 of store credit,1
143,1137,grubhub,302920553,2022-11-29 02:51:31,A 50/50 shot,honestly i have nothing against grubhub,2
143,1138,grubhub,302920553,2022-11-29 02:51:31,A 50/50 shot,when we lived in nyc it was the undisputed best app to order food from and it was overall what you had expect,2
143,1139,grubhub,302920553,2022-11-29 02:51:31,A 50/50 shot,reasonable and reliable,2
143,1140,grubhub,302920553,2022-11-29 02:51:31,A 50/50 shot,however since our move to la they really seem to have lost this,2
143,1141,grubhub,302920553,2022-11-29 02:51:31,A 50/50 shot,the orders are often wrong take a very long time and the customer support is not very supportive or helpful with this,2
143,1142,grubhub,302920553,2022-11-29 02:51:31,A 50/50 shot,i strongly believe that grubhub just is not a good option for la residents and that ordering restaurant direct or doordash are far superior options,2
144,1143,grubhub,302920553,2022-11-05 16:23:34,Overall cost is WAY too much for a single person!,between the inflated prices the 20 minimum order fee and the subscription it is an unreasonable situation for a person looking to order one meal a few times a month,2
144,1144,grubhub,302920553,2022-11-05 16:23:34,Overall cost is WAY too much for a single person!,i was about to order two meals the other day just to get my order approved but the cost was over 30 allin which is so much more than i wanted to spend,2
144,1145,grubhub,302920553,2022-11-05 16:23:34,Overall cost is WAY too much for a single person!,just by ordering that much food from the local sandwich shop i could save 10,2
145,1146,grubhub,302920553,2022-11-26 21:20:06,Worst app,i rather using  uber eat  all this dose is not have canes and more places the worst part is that they choose to tell me it is close at 10 that is a big lie the whole grabhub choose to close it then self i do not see what the point of doing payments to a membership if you all fina be losing places in you are own pick of time there no point why he taking people money if you all fina be lying about the service we pay for keep in mine there people who literally have no transportation,2
146,1147,grubhub,302920553,2022-11-08 20:10:30,Insulting customer service,i ordered pizza which was delivered cold long after it was picked up by the driver,2
146,1148,grubhub,302920553,2022-11-08 20:10:30,Insulting customer service,the customer service rep offered me a 5 refund,2
146,1149,grubhub,302920553,2022-11-08 20:10:30,Insulting customer service,i hate reheated pizza so for me the entire order was ruined and i paid ten times what they offered me,2
146,1150,grubhub,302920553,2022-11-08 20:10:30,Insulting customer service,when i continued to tell them their offer was unacceptable they increased the amount in 2 increments three times,2
146,1151,grubhub,302920553,2022-11-08 20:10:30,Insulting customer service,they have lost me as a customer,2
146,1152,grubhub,302920553,2022-11-08 20:10:30,Insulting customer service,door dash delivers from the same place without making the customer wait an hour for cold food,2
147,1153,grubhub,302920553,2022-11-11 17:20:53,Just get DoorDash or ubereats,all of the reviews are badalso grubhub charges the most compared to other delivery apps,1

150,1167,grubhub,302920553,2022-12-15 18:52:36,"Horrible customer service, bad options",tried to apply a gift card that i was given but no option to apply so i thought it would apply automatically at check out,1
150,1168,grubhub,302920553,2022-12-15 18:52:36,"Horrible customer service, bad options",the gift card did not apply and when i contacted customer service i was offered no help nothing to assure me this would not happen again,1
150,1169,grubhub,302920553,2022-12-15 18:52:36,"Horrible customer service, bad options",just that they did not have access to change it,1
150,1170,grubhub,302920553,2022-12-15 18:52:36,"Horrible customer service, bad options",i will not be using this app again based off this lost a potential customer and they can keep the gift card,1
151,1171,grubhub,302920553,2022-12-07 03:52:11,It's not just the app it's the entire company,when you have a major outage and you cannot even get in touch with a human being wait on hold for over 30 minutes just to be hung up on your credit card gets charged and nothing is delivered,1
151,1172,grubhub,302920553,2022-12-07 03:52:11,It's not just the app it's the entire company,sounds exactly like a company that deserves a lawsuit,1
151,1173,grubhub,302920553,2022-12-07 03:52:11,It's not just the app it's the entire company,grubhub is a joke,1
151,1174,grubhub,302920553,2022-12-07 03:52:11,It's not just the app it's the entire company,i will dispute every charge with my credit card company and delete the app,1
151,1175,grubhub,302920553,2022-12-07 03:52:11,It's not just the app it's the entire company,i will also seek legal charges because you cannot simply take peoples money and not provide the service and then not provide support,1
152,1176,grubhub,302920553,2022-12-05 13:37:53,Has Gotten Way Too Expensive Since the Pandemic,the service fee has skyrocketed from 9 of the subtotal to sometimes as high as 19 on my orders over the past few years,1
152,1177,grubhub,302920553,2022-12-05 13:37:53,Has Gotten Way Too Expensive Since the Pandemic,between that and the menu prices already being inflated vs ordering from the restaurant directly i decided to switch back over to doordash,1
152,1178,grubhub,302920553,2022-12-05 13:37:53,Has Gotten Way Too Expensive Since the Pandemic,the same meals from the same restaurants are several dollars cheaper before the tip on doordash now vs grubhub,1
152,1179,grubhub,302920553,2022-12-05 13:37:53,Has Gotten Way Too Expensive Since the Pandemic,disappointed because i had originally switched from doordash to grubhub as grubhub appeared to be cheaper at the time,1
152,1180,grubhub,302920553,2022-12-05 13:37:53,Has Gotten Way Too Expensive Since the Pandemic,not anymore,1
153,1181,grubhub,302920553,2022-10-12 22:18:49,Yummy!,grub hub has made it super easy to order from a wide variety of my favorite delivery restaurants,5
153,1182,grubhub,302920553,2022-10-12 22:18:49,Yummy!,the app gives fairly accurate delivery time estimatesi would prefer if grubhub included a section on whether a restaurant is capable of dealing with food allergies what the protocol is and then allow customers to indicate if that protocol is necessary,5
154,1183,grubhub,302920553,2022-12-01 01:00:57,Timing issues,i love the convenience of grubhub and i have used it quite a few times,2
154,1184,grubhub,302920553,2022-12-01 01:00:57,Timing issues,i have always had great drivers the only issue i really have is a recent one where when i order the driver can pick up multiple orders,2
154,1185,grubhub,302920553,2022-12-01 01:00:57,Timing issues,this causes issues because by the time i get my food it is never warm enough,2
154,1186,grubhub,302920553,2022-12-01 01:00:57,Timing issues,when i order and i am given a time and then it changes by 20 minutes it is happened enough to where i do not want to continue using the app,2
155,1187,grubhub,302920553,2022-11-20 13:05:40,Grubhub scammed me,i have been ordering from grubhub for a very long time i am sorry i had to give them a 1 star put i have bought an gift card for a family member but he did not want it so i redeemed it,1

155,1189,grubhub,302920553,2022-11-20 13:05:40,Grubhub scammed me,so i said ok it does not matter i will not use the gift card not i cannot order using my card apple pay or paypal,1
155,1190,grubhub,302920553,2022-11-20 13:05:40,Grubhub scammed me,atp i am starting to get angry,1
155,1191,grubhub,302920553,2022-11-20 13:05:40,Grubhub scammed me,i might delete my grubhub if they do not solve this issue,1
156,1192,grubhub,302920553,2022-10-05 01:59:37,Be careful of refunding too much,you have a limited amount of refunds for your account  after which is where they just handed you off to another specialist and said you cannot email or contact them so they have to email you within 7 to 10 business about the status change if not if no response then i guess no refund or concession so be careful with the amount of refunds or reporting you do cause you know now to be mindful of reporting such things,2
157,1193,grubhub,302920553,2022-09-17 13:31:12,I can't update any of my profile,for the past three days i have tried to update my profile  change the present address etc,2

158,1200,grubhub,302920553,2022-12-19 18:10:58,The worst drivers,they do not allow you to rate drivers on this app and i am noticing that every time i order using this app the drivers never follow the drop off instructions instead call and complain about having to get out of the car,3
158,1201,grubhub,302920553,2022-12-19 18:10:58,The worst drivers,i am sure if they did allow users to rate drivers the ratings would all be 1 star,3
158,1202,grubhub,302920553,2022-12-19 18:10:58,The worst drivers,so far the worst experience of all the food delivery apps i have used,3

160,1209,grubhub,302920553,2022-11-06 17:41:54,Delivery drivers,i like the fact that the drivers deliver the food  some drivers knock on the door and some do not,4
160,1210,grubhub,302920553,2022-11-06 17:41:54,Delivery drivers,but the one thing that gets me is the drivers do not read the special instructions for delivery,4
160,1211,grubhub,302920553,2022-11-06 17:41:54,Delivery drivers,if my instructions say to put the food on the doorstep and i open the door and the food is on the ground that bothers me thank you for your service,4

163,1218,grubhub,302920553,2022-12-15 18:50:16,Good but needs better delivery drivers,hire people who can speak english and can communicate thoroughly,3
163,1219,grubhub,302920553,2022-12-15 18:50:16,Good but needs better delivery drivers,some of your drivers also expect for the customer to meet them at their vehicles to receive our food,3

166,1228,grubhub,302920553,2022-10-18 13:55:50,terrible,this has got to be the worst app experience i have ever come across,1
166,1229,grubhub,302920553,2022-10-18 13:55:50,terrible,i wanted to order something through my university but had an error message along the lines of there are some fields that have not been filled in,1

166,1234,grubhub,302920553,2022-10-18 13:55:50,terrible,i then tried to chat with someone else and they said to restart the app which did not work or order using the website for the life of me i cannot figure out how to order from a restaurant on my campus through the app,1
166,1235,grubhub,302920553,2022-10-18 13:55:50,terrible,so not only is the app shut but it would seem the customer service is as well,1
167,1236,grubhub,302920553,2022-11-18 14:05:53,Restaurants not participating!,not sure what is happened postcovid but every single restaurant i want to order from is shown as closed on the app,1

167,1238,grubhub,302920553,2022-11-18 14:05:53,Restaurants not participating!,i went on door dash and the restaurants are open there so clearly restaurants do not seem to like grub hub,1
167,1239,grubhub,302920553,2022-11-18 14:05:53,Restaurants not participating!,also so many menus are limited compared to ordering direct from the restaurant,1

171,1254,grubhub,302920553,2022-09-18 21:06:26,Good but expensive,i agree with service charges but this is a bit much,4
171,1255,grubhub,302920553,2022-09-18 21:06:26,Good but expensive,but sometimes i am just lazy and do not want to drive so i guess it is worth it,4
171,1256,grubhub,302920553,2022-09-18 21:06:26,Good but expensive,app is decent but there often are items ingredients or toppings missing from the gh menus even though i know the restaurant has them like when i go there or order for pickup,4

176,1284,grubhub,302920553,2022-10-20 14:17:24,Terrible customer service,if you are going to use this service do not use gift cards,1
177,1285,grubhub,302920553,2022-09-29 21:46:58,Just use DoorDash,i usually use doordash but i figured i would try grubhub and boy was that a mistake,2
177,1286,grubhub,302920553,2022-09-29 21:46:58,Just use DoorDash,instead of allowing me to cancel an order that was going to take over 2 hours to arrive they offered a 10 voucher and claimed the order could not be canceled because the restaurant was already preparing it well grubhub that might be true but who wants food that is been sitting around the restaurant for over 2 hours,2
177,1287,grubhub,302920553,2022-09-29 21:46:58,Just use DoorDash,doordash has this figured out,2
177,1288,grubhub,302920553,2022-09-29 21:46:58,Just use DoorDash,give them a call,2
178,1289,grubhub,302920553,2022-09-23 23:24:16,Not happy,worst ordering experience my first time,1
178,1290,grubhub,302920553,2022-09-23 23:24:16,Not happy,my order was dropped off 10minutes away and another persons with a totally different name and address on the ticket was brought to my house,1
178,1291,grubhub,302920553,2022-09-23 23:24:16,Not happy,they did not do anything just cancelled it and refunded the money but was already hungry and waited another 25hrs to hear sorry place is closed now nothing we can do,1
178,1292,grubhub,302920553,2022-09-23 23:24:16,Not happy,just super disappointed and if the drivers and vendors even just looked at the order and address this could be prevented,1
178,1293,grubhub,302920553,2022-09-23 23:24:16,Not happy,never assume always verify,1
179,1294,grubhub,302920553,2022-10-24 01:57:44,Horrible customer service,i was a grubhub member but after today i canceled,1
179,1295,grubhub,302920553,2022-10-24 01:57:44,Horrible customer service,whenever i use this app to order either my order arrives missing entire items or the food is undercookedburgers especially,1
179,1296,grubhub,302920553,2022-10-24 01:57:44,Horrible customer service,today i did not receive my entire order and when contacted for a refund was told they could not do it because of my recent refund requests and they can offer a 10 off coupon,1
179,1297,grubhub,302920553,2022-10-24 01:57:44,Horrible customer service,no i want my money back to spend on something else,1
179,1298,grubhub,302920553,2022-10-24 01:57:44,Horrible customer service,would not recommend,1
180,1299,grubhub,302920553,2022-10-22 18:30:22,Door dash is better,had our driver drop our food then tell us we had to go to customer support to cancel our order told us we would get a refund 35 business days and we had a 5 off coupon that we have to use within 30 days and went to door dash instead and i am not saying this is grub hubs fault but we should not have to order another order and pay additional money for it just so someone could drop it  grub hub should pay for it the second time,1
181,1300,grubhub,302920553,2022-09-24 23:32:43,Just shocking how bad it is,i have used grubhub for a while now because it is honestly the only delivery app in my middle of nowhere town but this is genuinely one of the most inconvenient and awful delivery apps i have had the misfortune of having to use,1
181,1301,grubhub,302920553,2022-09-24 23:32:43,Just shocking how bad it is,problems are constant food delivered to the wrong address more than it should be and an interface that is very unresponsive and irritating,1
181,1302,grubhub,302920553,2022-09-24 23:32:43,Just shocking how bad it is,is it really that hard to send the same order to the same exact place more than once,1
182,1303,grubhub,302920553,2022-09-22 22:47:12,Good customer service,there are a few places that i will avoid because i know it is going to take forever to get the delivery when promised,4
182,1304,grubhub,302920553,2022-09-22 22:47:12,Good customer service,when that does happen however grubhub is good about compensating you with one click once your estimated delivery time window has come but your food has not,4
183,1305,grubhub,302920553,2022-12-02 20:53:23,Thank you GrubHub,thank you to a great concept it helps my sister and i get good hot food to our elderly mother and her mentally challenged sister,5
183,1306,grubhub,302920553,2022-12-02 20:53:23,Thank you GrubHub,we both live too far away to get healthy food to them on a regular basis,5
183,1307,grubhub,302920553,2022-12-02 20:53:23,Thank you GrubHub,being able to get them something different and tasty is very important,5
184,1308,grubhub,302920553,2022-11-14 01:12:38,Restaurants not even available,i ordered from a restaurant nearby the driver got there and my order was cancelled,1
184,1309,grubhub,302920553,2022-11-14 01:12:38,Restaurants not even available,we called the restaurant to find out they only take cash and do not even have grubhub,1
184,1310,grubhub,302920553,2022-11-14 01:12:38,Restaurants not even available,they did not have any of the items on grubhubs menu on their menu,1
184,1311,grubhub,302920553,2022-11-14 01:12:38,Restaurants not even available,no way to report the restaurant as not available on their app and their help section is no help,1
184,1312,grubhub,302920553,2022-11-14 01:12:38,Restaurants not even available,thankfully i was refunded considering i ordered 80 worth of food and we waited 45 minutes just for it to be cancelled,1
184,1313,grubhub,302920553,2022-11-14 01:12:38,Restaurants not even available,deleted the app,1
185,1314,grubhub,302920553,2022-11-10 22:22:53,App functionality recommendation,when ordering pizza there is no way to customize each half of the pizza for ordering different extrasseparately on each half of the pizza,4
185,1315,grubhub,302920553,2022-11-10 22:22:53,App functionality recommendation,i put special instructions for this which were not paid any attention,4
185,1316,grubhub,302920553,2022-11-10 22:22:53,App functionality recommendation,this would be great functionality to addto simplify orders and to maintain customer satisfaction,4
186,1317,grubhub,302920553,2022-10-15 00:28:22,Cancelled orders,it is disappointing to see that this app does not give their customers a discount on their next order when a restaurant cancels your order after waiting a significant amount of time,2
186,1318,grubhub,302920553,2022-10-15 00:28:22,Cancelled orders,it is best to just order from restaurants directly as they will say if they deliver to your address since most of the times they do not update their information on this application as to what their limits are with delivery,2
187,1319,grubhub,302920553,2022-09-21 02:12:38,Not worth it,grubhub plus is not worth it half the time it does not even give you 0 delivery and they compensate with an extra service fee anyways,1
187,1320,grubhub,302920553,2022-09-21 02:12:38,Not worth it,if you are paying for  that should cover the service fee and delivery,1
187,1321,grubhub,302920553,2022-09-21 02:12:38,Not worth it,otherwise there is no point you are not getting your food any cheaper with grub,1
187,1322,grubhub,302920553,2022-09-21 02:12:38,Not worth it,restaurant selection is slim pickings as well,1
187,1323,grubhub,302920553,2022-09-21 02:12:38,Not worth it,also  does not let you use promo codes with it you either get the perk or the promo it will not let you do both,1
187,1324,grubhub,302920553,2022-09-21 02:12:38,Not worth it,which is wrong,1
188,1325,grubhub,302920553,2022-09-22 21:40:40,Prompt service!,had issue right after i placed an order and i realized the place was closed,5
188,1326,grubhub,302920553,2022-09-22 21:40:40,Prompt service!,jumped on chat support and was refunded in mins with a 15 credit for the hours not being updated,5
188,1327,grubhub,302920553,2022-09-22 21:40:40,Prompt service!,it is always impressive to great and speedy customer service,5

189,1331,grubhub,302920553,2022-11-18 00:45:14,Insufficient Customer Service,customer service processed a refund and told me i had to reorder,1
189,1332,grubhub,302920553,2022-11-18 00:45:14,Insufficient Customer Service,there was no way for them to send the courier back or send another,1
189,1333,grubhub,302920553,2022-11-18 00:45:14,Insufficient Customer Service,i had to reorder and pay more than my refund for the forgotten items because of service fees,1
189,1334,grubhub,302920553,2022-11-18 00:45:14,Insufficient Customer Service,i will be deleting this app as soon as the replacement order arrives,1

190,1338,grubhub,302920553,2022-10-24 01:38:45,GrubHub should fold or go under.  They don't deserve to be in business!,nearly 8090 of my ordered have some form of error or issue,1

190,1340,grubhub,302920553,2022-10-24 01:38:45,GrubHub should fold or go under.  They don't deserve to be in business!,the second order arrived now 25 hours after we initially ordered our first order when we started getting hungry and an entire entree is missing,1
190,1341,grubhub,302920553,2022-10-24 01:38:45,GrubHub should fold or go under.  They don't deserve to be in business!,my elderly mother did not get the food she wanted and because we all purchased spicy items or other items she cannot have she had to eat crackers and tuna,1
190,1342,grubhub,302920553,2022-10-24 01:38:45,GrubHub should fold or go under.  They don't deserve to be in business!,this is just ridiculous,1
190,1343,grubhub,302920553,2022-10-24 01:38:45,GrubHub should fold or go under.  They don't deserve to be in business!,you would not have to steal so much of the restaurants money if you did not have to cover the costs of so many errors,1
191,1344,grubhub,302920553,2022-10-12 15:39:43,Terrible,never seem to get food delivered on time,1
191,1345,grubhub,302920553,2022-10-12 15:39:43,Terrible,can literally be a mile away from the store and somehow have to wait an hour and a half to two hours for every order,1
191,1346,grubhub,302920553,2022-10-12 15:39:43,Terrible,the care specialist just feed you the same lines they were clearly force fed and then you repeat the process all over again on the next order,1
191,1347,grubhub,302920553,2022-10-12 15:39:43,Terrible,the best part,1
191,1348,grubhub,302920553,2022-10-12 15:39:43,Terrible,paying a subscription so that grubhub guarantees on time delivery and still having never had an order delivered on time,1

195,1362,grubhub,302920553,2022-11-04 22:36:01,Grubhub plus worth,it is worth the savings with no delivery fee which sometimes is what turns me off from a lot of places,5

197,1372,grubhub,302920553,2022-10-30 19:50:45,Thieves,this means that delivery fees are waived for orders over 12,1
197,1373,grubhub,302920553,2022-10-30 19:50:45,Thieves,randomly grubhub has been charging me for delivery fees which can get very expensive even though i am a  member and have orders over 12,1
197,1374,grubhub,302920553,2022-10-30 19:50:45,Thieves,i have attempted deleting the app restarting it calling the help line and speaking with a help representative over chat,1

199,1389,grubhub,302920553,2022-09-11 21:33:57,Terrible service,right way would have been to attempt to expedite a new delivery but now i have to use another service and wait another hour,1

201,1394,grubhub,302920553,2022-12-04 18:39:01,Everything is always wrong,this stuff is written down so is it that hard to work from a list and someone check it before it goes out,2

201,1396,grubhub,302920553,2022-12-04 18:39:01,Everything is always wrong,so now i have to get a refund and wait for my money 35 days and reorder her stuff so we can wait another hour and she can eat her stuff alone,2
202,1399,grubhub,302920553,2022-10-31 05:46:34,Incompetent Drivers,my delivery driver walked up to me i was not sure what he said when i told him my name to confirm if it was my delivery he just got on his bike turned away and said the delivery was for a girl,1
202,1400,grubhub,302920553,2022-10-31 05:46:34,Incompetent Drivers,these are the types of people grubhub hires how in the world would he know it was for a female and why did not he stop and talk to methe doorman to try and figure out the proper address,1
202,1401,grubhub,302920553,2022-10-31 05:46:34,Incompetent Drivers,instead he just drove away with my food put my job at risk as i left my post to chase him down and caused me a lot of my time smh,1
203,1402,grubhub,302920553,2022-10-21 18:55:39,Crooked company,they force you to work on a schedule otherwise they will not give you a lot of orders and will give you 4 orders going 10 miles away as a punishment and if you reject the order it affects your acceptance rate which they will eventually deactivate you for they treat their drivers like employees yet they label us as independent contractors,1
203,1403,grubhub,302920553,2022-10-21 18:55:39,Crooked company,this company should not be in business for breaking labor laws continuously and people should not drive for them because they will take advantage of you,1
204,1404,grubhub,302920553,2022-11-22 18:05:42,Great if your busy or just too lazy,i live away from the city and sometimes i am either too busy or lazy to run out or cook,5

206,1417,grubhub,302920553,2022-11-01 02:07:37,Never Again,we called the pizza place and the first thing they asked was did you use grubhub and that they have had nothing but problems with drivers stealing food and messing up orders,1
206,1418,grubhub,302920553,2022-11-01 02:07:37,Never Again,when a restaurant begs customers not to use a service that makes them money you know there is a problem,1
206,1419,grubhub,302920553,2022-11-01 02:07:37,Never Again,grubhub customer service does not care in the slightest,1

208,1432,grubhub,302920553,2022-10-26 23:49:37,Here's my honest opinion,grubhub is convenient and less expensive than other delivery places often food does get delivered cold and constant missing items,4

209,1438,grubhub,302920553,2022-10-14 23:33:02,Random Delivery Times & Terrible Customer Service,worst part is that grubhub has a policy that says food late we will give you a voucher but they change the delivery time before you can even put that option in,3
209,1439,grubhub,302920553,2022-10-14 23:33:02,Random Delivery Times & Terrible Customer Service,customer service is hit or miss,3
209,1440,grubhub,302920553,2022-10-14 23:33:02,Random Delivery Times & Terrible Customer Service,honestly you are better off with ubereats or doordash,3
210,1441,grubhub,302920553,2022-10-12 04:11:47,Awful,grub hub never rings the bell or texts,1
210,1442,grubhub,302920553,2022-10-12 04:11:47,Awful,they just leave the food and hope you you will wander to the front door and see it is there,1
210,1443,grubhub,302920553,2022-10-12 04:11:47,Awful,you can put a note on your order you can click the little check that says text me you can tip 10but it does not matter,1

210,1445,grubhub,302920553,2022-10-12 04:11:47,Awful,this has happened over and over and over again,1
210,1446,grubhub,302920553,2022-10-12 04:11:47,Awful,completely insane way to run a delivery service,1
210,1447,grubhub,302920553,2022-10-12 04:11:47,Awful,bye grub hub,1
211,1448,grubhub,302920553,2022-09-29 02:18:10,Screen limitation,we order on an ipad,4
211,1449,grubhub,302920553,2022-09-29 02:18:10,Screen limitation,when we order too many line items it will not allow us to scroll to the bottom,4
211,1450,grubhub,302920553,2022-09-29 02:18:10,Screen limitation,we have to delete an item or 2 in order to verify what is not visible on the screen then go back and increaseadd items,4
212,1451,grubhub,302920553,2022-11-20 23:24:57,It's almost always wrong,not feeling well so have gotten grub hub this weekend for the family,1
212,1452,grubhub,302920553,2022-11-20 23:24:57,It's almost always wrong,i have ordered it 4 times in two days,1
212,1453,grubhub,302920553,2022-11-20 23:24:57,It's almost always wrong,three out of four times the order was wrong,1
212,1454,grubhub,302920553,2022-11-20 23:24:57,It's almost always wrong,the last time it took 2x the length of time it was suppose to and when it got here the ice cream was almost completely melted,1
212,1455,grubhub,302920553,2022-11-20 23:24:57,It's almost always wrong,did i mention it was not even the correct order,1
212,1456,grubhub,302920553,2022-11-20 23:24:57,It's almost always wrong,you pay extra for convenience but all you get is cold food you did not even want,1
213,1457,grubhub,302920553,2022-11-07 01:56:22,Bad Delivery Driver,he did not drop off my food when i was waiting at the drop off,1
213,1458,grubhub,302920553,2022-11-07 01:56:22,Bad Delivery Driver,refused to give any landmarks when i asked for them and there are very obvious landmarks,1
213,1459,grubhub,302920553,2022-11-07 01:56:22,Bad Delivery Driver,grubhub gave me a redelivery but decided to assign the same driver who did not deliver the first time,1
213,1460,grubhub,302920553,2022-11-07 01:56:22,Bad Delivery Driver,did not accept my order cancel which is fine but still decided to do a second delivery,1
213,1461,grubhub,302920553,2022-11-07 01:56:22,Bad Delivery Driver,so the driver still got my money,1
213,1462,grubhub,302920553,2022-11-07 01:56:22,Bad Delivery Driver,i am okay with the restaurant being paired but why should he get my money when he ruined my night,1
214,1463,grubhub,302920553,2022-10-31 23:11:01,Receipts Not Itemized,be warnedif you are ordering group lunch for you and your coworkers the receipt grubhub provides is not itemized it only lists the amount for your order even if you paid the whole bill,1
214,1464,grubhub,302920553,2022-10-31 23:11:01,Receipts Not Itemized,itemized receipts are a requirement most companies have when it is time to get reimbursed,1
214,1465,grubhub,302920553,2022-10-31 23:11:01,Receipts Not Itemized,i was shocked when the grubhub costumer care representative just told me i would need to contact everyone of my coworkers who ordered food using the group order link that is generated through the appsi would stick with ubereats,1
215,1466,grubhub,302920553,2022-10-22 21:33:21,Panera and gift card,could not figure out how to apply gift card,4
215,1467,grubhub,302920553,2022-10-22 21:33:21,Panera and gift card,committed to pay out of pocket and finally found the option during review,4
215,1468,grubhub,302920553,2022-10-22 21:33:21,Panera and gift card,not intuitive,4
215,1469,grubhub,302920553,2022-10-22 21:33:21,Panera and gift card,highly recommend you add a note to payment screen that says have a gift card,4
215,1470,grubhub,302920553,2022-10-22 21:33:21,Panera and gift card,you can apply it at the final review next screen,4
216,1471,grubhub,302920553,2022-10-02 01:43:31,Missed items,twice when ordering from applebees there were items missing from my order,1
216,1472,grubhub,302920553,2022-10-02 01:43:31,Missed items,the first time a meal was left on the counter and the second time one item was missed,1
216,1473,grubhub,302920553,2022-10-02 01:43:31,Missed items,applebees said i need to contact grubhub for a refund,1
216,1474,grubhub,302920553,2022-10-02 01:43:31,Missed items,i was not able to find any contact info for grubhub so i was out the food and the money,1
216,1475,grubhub,302920553,2022-10-02 01:43:31,Missed items,on the second order i did tell them of the prior error in the comments but i surmise they do not care,1
216,1476,grubhub,302920553,2022-10-02 01:43:31,Missed items,they got their money at my loss,1
217,1477,grubhub,302920553,2022-09-28 23:48:18,Grubhub Review,i like grubhub,3

217,1479,grubhub,302920553,2022-09-28 23:48:18,Grubhub Review,firstly their customer service is really outstanding,3
217,1480,grubhub,302920553,2022-09-28 23:48:18,Grubhub Review,each person tries their best to respectfully solve your issue,3
217,1481,grubhub,302920553,2022-09-28 23:48:18,Grubhub Review,i have to mention the prices are quite high and by the time you come out of the app you are paying a pretty penny for your food,3
217,1482,grubhub,302920553,2022-09-28 23:48:18,Grubhub Review,many of the restaurant employees do not read the order properly either,3
217,1483,grubhub,302920553,2022-09-28 23:48:18,Grubhub Review,lastly time is never a priority,3
217,1484,grubhub,302920553,2022-09-28 23:48:18,Grubhub Review,the drivers often come from all over to bring the food and by the time it gets here it is cold,3
217,1485,grubhub,302920553,2022-09-28 23:48:18,Grubhub Review,in spite of all this grubhub is the best app,3
217,1486,grubhub,302920553,2022-09-28 23:48:18,Grubhub Review,and by all but a few dollars worth the price,3
218,1487,grubhub,302920553,2022-09-24 18:59:04,Food never came,after being delayed once i looked back on the map and the driver still was not going to the store,1
218,1488,grubhub,302920553,2022-09-24 18:59:04,Food never came,contacted customer service said it would be around 30 more minutes another delay,1
218,1489,grubhub,302920553,2022-09-24 18:59:04,Food never came,i had so much time to think about how lazy i am and decided to get get it myself,1
218,1490,grubhub,302920553,2022-09-24 18:59:04,Food never came,god as my witness the restaurant was 5 minutes to my house terrible all around,1
218,1491,grubhub,302920553,2022-09-24 18:59:04,Food never came,first time using grubhub too,1
218,1492,grubhub,302920553,2022-09-24 18:59:04,Food never came,despite doordash having a terrible menu it is much more efficient,1
219,1493,grubhub,302920553,2022-12-19 01:29:47,Just order from the restaurant directly,it is bad enough the amount of fees they tack on to every order but most of the menu prices are dollars more than what the restaurant charges,1
219,1494,grubhub,302920553,2022-12-19 01:29:47,Just order from the restaurant directly,what would have been an 18 order from a restaurant jumped up to 35 before tip solely from fees taxes and gh charging 3 more per item from that restaurant,1

220,1500,grubhub,302920553,2022-12-16 02:33:25,Always missing food!!!,they simply  pick up without confirming they have everything,1
220,1501,grubhub,302920553,2022-12-16 02:33:25,Always missing food!!!,what is worse is that once you claim that food is missing on the grubhub help service all they do is say sorry and refund you,1
220,1502,grubhub,302920553,2022-12-16 02:33:25,Always missing food!!!,they miss the whole point of the inconvenience they have caused and the reason why we ordered delivery for a reason,1

223,1509,grubhub,302920553,2022-11-02 07:22:06,Terrible customer service,i order 30 minutes before the store was supposed to close when the driver got there they told them they did not make the order driver leaves i never get my order after 50 minutes of waiting i contacted customer service to find out they cancelled it because it was not made and i do not find out till 30 minutes after i was supposed to get my order and only because i contacted them,1

255,1644,grubhub,302920553,2022-11-19 21:24:38,Check your totals,it is because this company is not updating prices on their app like they are suppose to do so stuff like this does not happen,1

258,1657,grubhub,302920553,2022-10-02 21:01:05,Deleting the App,have used many of these apps and this one may have the worst customer experience as it does not allow me to control notifications intuitively or communicate with anyone that can actually talk to me,2

270,1715,grubhub,302920553,2022-10-19 20:25:47,A great app,rad mason,5
271,1716,grubhub,302920553,2022-12-17 03:02:42,Horrible Customer Service,texting services or calling services to the drivers no longer work,1

271,1720,grubhub,302920553,2022-12-17 03:02:42,Horrible Customer Service,and then when you try to talk to somebody online you get fake responses and they do not even read what the problem is,1
271,1721,grubhub,302920553,2022-12-17 03:02:42,Horrible Customer Service,they are completely useless,1
272,1722,grubhub,302920553,2022-11-28 17:54:11,Mostly okay. Can't get my address corrected.,the app serves its purpose most of the time but my address has been wrong for months and i have been going back and forth with customer service but gotten no help,3

273,1724,grubhub,302920553,2022-11-05 06:37:10,Delivery instructions are there for a reason,more of a criticism of gh not the drivers or restaurants,4

276,1735,grubhub,302920553,2022-10-27 22:24:59,Needs more options and coupons,not that many places to pick in my area and it definitely needs more promo codes specially on the weekend were many other delivery apps give at least a 10 off just because it is the weekend,3
277,1736,grubhub,302920553,2022-10-16 02:37:32,Options,why give customers options if you are going to do whatever you want anyway,3
277,1737,grubhub,302920553,2022-10-16 02:37:32,Options,if i wanted my food sitting outside unattended i would have asked for it to be left i unattended,3

288,1782,grubhub,302920553,2022-12-03 21:15:55,Service fees,this is an add in that was not there until2020,5
288,1783,grubhub,302920553,2022-12-03 21:15:55,Service fees,should be removed,5
288,1784,grubhub,302920553,2022-12-03 21:15:55,Service fees,it is the amount of tip i give to the delivery person,5

288,1786,grubhub,302920553,2022-12-03 21:15:55,Service fees,because of the service fee maybe 3x monthly,5

290,1789,grubhub,302920553,2022-11-28 22:09:56,Rip Off,eight dollars in fees just to run grubhub and i have to pay an additional five dollar tip to a delivery person,1
290,1790,grubhub,302920553,2022-11-28 22:09:56,Rip Off,even more annoying as you cannot directly order from the restaurants themselves because they bought into the service,1
290,1791,grubhub,302920553,2022-11-28 22:09:56,Rip Off,super disappointed,1
290,1792,grubhub,302920553,2022-11-28 22:09:56,Rip Off,times have changed,1

291,1797,grubhub,302920553,2022-11-21 00:11:58,Listen to me.,and then refunded what you did not bring,1
291,1798,grubhub,302920553,2022-11-21 00:11:58,Listen to me.,but then if i still want the food i ordered i have to spend even more money than i was originally,1
291,1799,grubhub,302920553,2022-11-21 00:11:58,Listen to me.,and you also took increased taxes and delivery fees from the first order already,1

299,1842,grubhub,302920553,2022-10-01 16:10:22,Kudos to Grubhub!,i choose to order from grubhub above all other delivery options because their drivers 95 of the time follow instructions are courteous and respectful and pay attention to detail,5

326,1950,grubhub,302920553,2022-12-16 21:06:07,Deliveries Are Often Wrong!,waiting a hour for food and the only resolution is a refund does not build trust in your ability to provide a service,2

329,1963,grubhub,302920553,2022-11-04 21:39:16,Too expensive,door dash does not,3
329,1964,grubhub,302920553,2022-11-04 21:39:16,Too expensive,the only time i order through grub hub these days is if i cannot find the restaurant i want on door dash and i cannot go pick up the order,3
330,1965,grubhub,302920553,2022-11-01 20:27:53,As people have mentioned… customer service is garbage,i feel like there have been too many incidences where the order was partially missing and they only refund you the cost of the missing food but not the delivery fees,1
330,1966,grubhub,302920553,2022-11-01 20:27:53,As people have mentioned… customer service is garbage,ordered four items only one came and still had to pay the entire cost of fees,1

331,1970,grubhub,302920553,2022-10-14 10:26:01,Trash,all just randomly assigns people as quickly as possible and will not show they have cancelled until they have a new driver that may also cancel,1
331,1971,grubhub,302920553,2022-10-14 10:26:01,Trash,all this after already placing the order,1
331,1972,grubhub,302920553,2022-10-14 10:26:01,Trash,it is like a game if will i ever get my food roulettethe end result is that the app owners bend over the users drivers and stores while holding zero accountability,1

356,2056,grubhub,302920553,2022-12-08 23:12:44,Recently broken,and if that is the case it is ridiculous to track users that pay real money for a service,1
356,2057,grubhub,302920553,2022-12-08 23:12:44,Recently broken,please cut this crap out and hire more engineers if necessary to work properly,1

359,2061,grubhub,302920553,2022-11-12 02:27:37,Not worth it,grubhub is very poorly run here in north texas,1
359,2062,grubhub,302920553,2022-11-12 02:27:37,Not worth it,the lack of drivers poor customer service very long delivery delays are not worth a consumers time and aggravation,1
359,2063,grubhub,302920553,2022-11-12 02:27:37,Not worth it,how can a convenience service be so inconvenient,1
359,2064,grubhub,302920553,2022-11-12 02:27:37,Not worth it,until grubhub gets their act together in switching to another service,1
359,2065,grubhub,302920553,2022-11-12 02:27:37,Not worth it,my order took over an hour and a half to be delivered which is unacceptable,1

369,2096,grubhub,302920553,2022-10-29 17:58:48,Greed,i think it is past time for delivery services as well as the restaurants do away with the service fees to cover operating costs,3
369,2097,grubhub,302920553,2022-10-29 17:58:48,Greed,fake covid is no longer an issue,3

373,2110,grubhub,302920553,2022-11-12 00:30:03,Credits disappear without warning,there should be an email warning us they are going to expire if there is a short expiration date on it,2
374,2111,grubhub,302920553,2022-10-05 20:10:50,Food always cold …,not sure how this thing works but every time i am forced to use food apps like this my food is always cold and nasty,2
374,2112,grubhub,302920553,2022-10-05 20:10:50,Food always cold …,one time at work someone even cancelled picking up my order so it took 2 hours,2
374,2113,grubhub,302920553,2022-10-05 20:10:50,Food always cold …,really disappointed,2
374,2114,grubhub,302920553,2022-10-05 20:10:50,Food always cold …,would not recommend unless you have no other choice,2

376,2119,grubhub,302920553,2022-11-20 17:27:52,Love this service,four stars because i wish that when restaurants did there own delivery i could track their progress to my door,4
377,2120,grubhub,302920553,2022-09-17 17:59:47,Restaurant list deceiving,i love grubhub but i do not love that some restaurants are just certain foods from other restaurants listed ie wild burger being just a list of burgers from buffalo wild wings,4
377,2121,grubhub,302920553,2022-09-17 17:59:47,Restaurant list deceiving,it is very deceiving because it does not state that in menu,4
378,2122,grubhub,302920553,2022-09-17 02:17:36,Orders always late. No compensation ever,my order has been over an hour late or has been dropped an hour after purchase the last three times i have purchased,1
378,2123,grubhub,302920553,2022-09-17 02:17:36,Orders always late. No compensation ever,you cannot get ahold of them on the phone due to usually high call volume and the people you talk to through the app refuse to refund you,1
378,2124,grubhub,302920553,2022-09-17 02:17:36,Orders always late. No compensation ever,use any other food delivery app,1
379,2125,grubhub,302920553,2022-09-23 02:47:14,Incorrect menu prices lead to being charged extra without consent.,restaurants should not be able to charge the customers extra money bc the app has not been updated to show the new prices,3
379,2126,grubhub,302920553,2022-09-23 02:47:14,Incorrect menu prices lead to being charged extra without consent.,that is not the customers fault,3
380,2127,grubhub,302920553,2022-12-21 03:26:08,Worst delivery app,my order was already going to be delivered late switched several drivers before being cancelled,1
380,2128,grubhub,302920553,2022-12-21 03:26:08,Worst delivery app,waited almost an hour and a half before not even getting my food,1
380,2129,grubhub,302920553,2022-12-21 03:26:08,Worst delivery app,then their offering was 5 off next order which is what i already used on the one that got cancelled,1
380,2130,grubhub,302920553,2022-12-21 03:26:08,Worst delivery app,pretty pathetic solution if you ask me,1
381,2131,grubhub,302920553,2022-12-10 02:11:41,ALWAYS late and ALWAYS cold,it is suspicious that grubhub has so many reviews that are overwhelmingly negative but still show as five stars,1
381,2132,grubhub,302920553,2022-12-10 02:11:41,ALWAYS late and ALWAYS cold,anyway every time we have used them the map always shows the driver going to the restaurant then going to a completely different restaurant and doing another delivery before they finally arrive with your order,1
382,2133,grubhub,302920553,2022-11-27 16:22:01,Delivery drivers do not care about the disabled,time and time again the delivery drivers ignore the delivery instructions that i am wheelchair bound and need the food delivered to my door,2
382,2134,grubhub,302920553,2022-11-27 16:22:01,Delivery drivers do not care about the disabled,instead they leave it on the front steps of my 6 story apartment building where it is immediately stolen,2
382,2135,grubhub,302920553,2022-11-27 16:22:01,Delivery drivers do not care about the disabled,they could care less,2
383,2136,grubhub,302920553,2022-11-26 03:11:06,This app is trash,they take orders even when they have no drivers logged inavailable then just keep delaying the order so you are waiting an hour and a half just for them to end up cancelling due to not being able to find a driver,1
383,2137,grubhub,302920553,2022-11-26 03:11:06,This app is trash,you could have eaten 4 times by then,1
383,2138,grubhub,302920553,2022-11-26 03:11:06,This app is trash,i could have made 7 different meals just tell us there is noone available instead of making us wait nearly 2 hours while hungry just to cancel ya jerks,1
384,2140,grubhub,302920553,2022-11-20 19:40:02,Don't order through these guys,i cannot count how many times i gone through to the app just to find that delivery is paused due to high demand every time i ended up using doordash i was only able to order about three times out of the several hundreds of times that i went to thier app just go through door dash they will deliver for you,1
385,2141,grubhub,302920553,2022-10-31 02:15:43,Expensive waste,prices keep going up while service and speed continue to decline,2
385,2142,grubhub,302920553,2022-10-31 02:15:43,Expensive waste,unless you have no other option grubhub is definitely not worth paying double for your food just to get it an hour later,2
385,2143,grubhub,302920553,2022-10-31 02:15:43,Expensive waste,if you get it at all,2
386,2144,grubhub,302920553,2022-10-24 00:26:37,Horrible drivers always get lost,we live in the metro area of boston and constantly have delayed drivers over 2 hours from when we ordered  and when someone finally is found they can never navigate their way to our house,1
386,2145,grubhub,302920553,2022-10-24 00:26:37,Horrible drivers always get lost,in this day and age how someone can have this job without being able to follow a gps is unacceptable,1
387,2146,grubhub,302920553,2022-10-17 15:45:24,Terrible Customer Service,incorrect order which happens but then followed by a poor customer service to which my chat was ended by the rep because i could not respond quickly enough,1
387,2147,grubhub,302920553,2022-10-17 15:45:24,Terrible Customer Service,to summarize we ordered 4 items they delivered one charged us 20 for it and said it was company policy,1
387,2148,grubhub,302920553,2022-10-17 15:45:24,Terrible Customer Service,last time using this service,1

388,2152,grubhub,302920553,2022-09-17 23:43:51,3rd strikeout,i was willing to not complain as long as i was refunded but the gave me back only 20 dollars on a 60 dollar meal missing half the items,1
388,2153,grubhub,302920553,2022-09-17 23:43:51,3rd strikeout,time to uninstall and stick with uber eats or doordash,1
389,2154,grubhub,302920553,2022-10-04 23:12:26,Better Than UberEats,compared to having the app in 2020 the bugs and glitches in the app are not as major anymore,5
390,2155,grubhub,302920553,2022-12-09 18:32:35,Worst Food Delivery Ever:,for a month straight they have been telling me i have to wait 48 hours if they need anything without giving me anymore information i am done using this app for good after i get my refund for the order that never went through i am deleting this app and never coming back to it,1
390,2156,grubhub,302920553,2022-12-09 18:32:35,Worst Food Delivery Ever:,this is unbelievable ya will want people to use the app but cannot order food and saying 48 hours for a month straight is not 48 hours,1
391,2158,grubhub,302920553,2022-12-02 19:34:44,App is super sketchy,app would not allow me to update my address,2
391,2159,grubhub,302920553,2022-12-02 19:34:44,App is super sketchy,took me 20 minutes to have to delete and readd the app,2
391,2160,grubhub,302920553,2022-12-02 19:34:44,App is super sketchy,to get the address updated,2
391,2161,grubhub,302920553,2022-12-02 19:34:44,App is super sketchy,then i was offered 5 but when it was time to pay the option for the 5 off was no where available,2
392,2162,grubhub,302920553,2022-11-30 00:54:05,Refuses to give refunds when you don't get items,i have a huge problem with drivers leaving my drinks and kids meals out,1
392,2163,grubhub,302920553,2022-11-30 00:54:05,Refuses to give refunds when you don't get items,which is pretty much the sole purpose of me ordering food to make them happy and i cannot even manage that by using this app,1
392,2164,grubhub,302920553,2022-11-30 00:54:05,Refuses to give refunds when you don't get items,so i am out the money on those items and i gotta go spent the money again and go get it myself,1
393,2165,grubhub,302920553,2022-11-17 22:37:12,Buyers be aware,they can charge additional funds even several days after the order beyond what is agreed on when checking out and they will not even notify you,1
393,2166,grubhub,302920553,2022-11-17 22:37:12,Buyers be aware,remember to check your bank statements,1
393,2167,grubhub,302920553,2022-11-17 22:37:12,Buyers be aware,they claim this is the adjustment for mismatch pricing but they are the ones who put the wrong price on the menu in the first place,1
394,2168,grubhub,302920553,2022-11-11 17:40:09,What happened to my restaurants?,all of a sudden i no longer find the black owned restaurants i order from on grubhub,1

395,2174,grubhub,302920553,2022-10-26 16:24:17,Don't try this app,you are better off going to the restaurant and places in person to save some money,1
395,2175,grubhub,302920553,2022-10-26 16:24:17,Don't try this app,this app is not worth it,1

398,2184,grubhub,302920553,2022-11-20 13:32:27,Tips options,everything is good but why the default tip option is 1 put it higher sometimes i press confirm and forget to edit the tip default tip should be atleast 10,4
399,2185,grubhub,302920553,2022-12-01 23:08:43,Wish I could add more sauces,the app is ok,3
399,2186,grubhub,302920553,2022-12-01 23:08:43,Wish I could add more sauces,it is frustrating when i want to add more sauces from a place for whatever cost but i cannot do that with the app,3
399,2187,grubhub,302920553,2022-12-01 23:08:43,Wish I could add more sauces,if it had an option to add however many additional sauces then it would be great,3

401,2189,grubhub,302920553,2022-11-14 02:05:04,Way better than Uber eats,best customer service user friendly interface and supports restaurants,5
402,2190,grubhub,302920553,2022-10-20 21:03:58,Price,just wish they were a little cheaper other wise fantastic,5
403,2191,grubhub,302920553,2022-10-30 16:07:42,Beware of marked up price,i noticed prices have increased significantly from the restaurant i frequented after comparing prices through the restaurants website to grubhubs true enough grubhub had significantly marked up all the prices do not fall for coupon and their scam you are still paying more after taking into account all the marked up items,1
404,2192,grubhub,302920553,2022-10-22 03:31:25,Bad customer service,i chatted with a customer service rep zachary v he was terrible to work with should definitely not be working in customer service,1
404,2193,grubhub,302920553,2022-10-22 03:31:25,Bad customer service,did not issue the credit he told me he would refused to cancel an order even though they had not even made the food yet,1
404,2194,grubhub,302920553,2022-10-22 03:31:25,Bad customer service,very disappointed in the quality coming from grubhub lately,1
405,2195,grubhub,302920553,2022-10-12 00:44:05,error,could not order from toppings for right half of pizza from the app,5
405,2196,grubhub,302920553,2022-10-12 00:44:05,error,only way to order was to reorder a pizza i ordered previously,5
406,2197,grubhub,302920553,2022-11-29 01:57:23,Driver Erika,she communicated all aspects of the delivery process and i was able to speak to her from afar,5
406,2198,grubhub,302920553,2022-11-29 01:57:23,Driver Erika,she was very friendly and made our experience great,5
407,2199,grubhub,302920553,2022-12-05 02:18:55,Good but portion was small for the price,for 25 20 for food and fees and 5 for tip i was expecting this dense and solid meal but instead i got about 7 small pieces of chicken,4
407,2200,grubhub,302920553,2022-12-05 02:18:55,Good but portion was small for the price,it was delicious but for that portion 12 would have been more justly,4
408,2201,grubhub,302920553,2022-11-19 01:07:53,Missed item,total cost was over 200 and my pot stickers were absent,5
408,2202,grubhub,302920553,2022-11-19 01:07:53,Missed item,not except able,5
409,2203,grubhub,302920553,2022-11-27 16:36:13,Uninstalling,your refund process is ridiculous,1
409,2204,grubhub,302920553,2022-11-27 16:36:13,Uninstalling,you subtract the partial refund from the original amount and then charge me again for that amount,1
409,2205,grubhub,302920553,2022-11-27 16:36:13,Uninstalling,then you process the refund for the first charge which takes days to clear so for a while i am double charged instead of a basic partial refund,1
410,2206,grubhub,302920553,2022-10-07 21:42:55,Love chipotle!,great that i can now get it delivered right to my doorstep i look forward to trying the new steak they have added to their menu,5
411,2207,grubhub,302920553,2022-11-15 17:18:01,EXPENSIVE,work gave me a 25 gift card,1
411,2208,grubhub,302920553,2022-11-15 17:18:01,EXPENSIVE,most of the restaurants i would pick still had 12 18 more to pay even after the 25,1
411,2209,grubhub,302920553,2022-11-15 17:18:01,EXPENSIVE,who knew getting pho 2 spring rolls and a tea delivered to your house cost over 40,1
411,2210,grubhub,302920553,2022-11-15 17:18:01,EXPENSIVE,i finally found a restaurant that only had 7 in excess of 25 for my pho spring rolls and tea,1
411,2211,grubhub,302920553,2022-11-15 17:18:01,EXPENSIVE,too bad i have already lost my sanity due to how expensive this country is,1
412,2212,grubhub,302920553,2022-11-13 21:37:20,Why is this $20 more than it should be? Literally,6 dollar deal delivery fee plus upcharge on dishes in general plus service charge plus tip,2
412,2213,grubhub,302920553,2022-11-13 21:37:20,Why is this $20 more than it should be? Literally,even more expensive than door dash and other delivery services,2
412,2214,grubhub,302920553,2022-11-13 21:37:20,Why is this $20 more than it should be? Literally,a dish that would normally cost me 18 ended up costing 38,2
412,2215,grubhub,302920553,2022-11-13 21:37:20,Why is this $20 more than it should be? Literally,will not be using this app again,2
413,2216,grubhub,302920553,2022-10-12 00:10:19,It works.,to be honest the only reason i will give 2 stars is because you were the only app with drivers out right now,2
413,2217,grubhub,302920553,2022-10-12 00:10:19,It works.,otherwise your delivery fees are disgusting and i would not use your app if i did not have to,2
413,2218,grubhub,302920553,2022-10-12 00:10:19,It works.,but still you came in clutch with a 20 double cheeseburger from steak n shake,2
414,2219,grubhub,302920553,2022-09-13 21:53:28,Awesome food,took a while to get but i ordered during traffic time but i must say it was hot crispy and really tasteful only problem is they forgot the drink and cookie that came with the pot pie meal other than that it was really good,4
415,2220,grubhub,302920553,2022-09-17 02:54:10,Glitchy,i like that they pay their drivers,3
415,2221,grubhub,302920553,2022-09-17 02:54:10,Glitchy,but the app could use some work,3
415,2222,grubhub,302920553,2022-09-17 02:54:10,Glitchy,it froze to where i could not make any selections and had to closeopen a couple times to get back to my orders,3
416,2223,grubhub,302920553,2022-12-04 16:13:32,Great service,first time i have use it,5
416,2224,grubhub,302920553,2022-12-04 16:13:32,Great service,it was indeed awesome,5
416,2225,grubhub,302920553,2022-12-04 16:13:32,Great service,but i wish i could have had more choices of restaurants especially captain cook,5
416,2226,grubhub,302920553,2022-12-04 16:13:32,Great service,great service,5
417,2228,grubhub,302920553,2022-12-18 17:49:07,App is a scam,you you will wait 2 hours for your order and it will either be ice cold and halfsmashed or it will not arrive at all,1
417,2229,grubhub,302920553,2022-12-18 17:49:07,App is a scam,but do not worry they will give you 5 off your next order in lieu of a refund on the food you never got in this one,1
417,2230,grubhub,302920553,2022-12-18 17:49:07,App is a scam,i gave grubhub 3 tries and they were all dismal failures,1
417,2231,grubhub,302920553,2022-12-18 17:49:07,App is a scam,do not use this app if you value your time money and sanity,1
418,2232,grubhub,302920553,2022-11-01 15:35:41,Drivers,drivers are great but some of the food establishments i have chosen are sub par,5
418,2233,grubhub,302920553,2022-11-01 15:35:41,Drivers,i have vertigo and cannot drive right now,5
418,2234,grubhub,302920553,2022-11-01 15:35:41,Drivers,this helps me tremendously,5
418,2235,grubhub,302920553,2022-11-01 15:35:41,Drivers,thank you,5
419,2236,grubhub,302920553,2022-11-15 20:33:39,Terrible Customer Service,they do not take responsibility for any wrongmissing item delivered,3
419,2237,grubhub,302920553,2022-11-15 20:33:39,Terrible Customer Service,they just issue a refund and tell you to reorder but why would i reorder when i know the next one can be wrong too,3
420,2238,grubhub,302920553,2022-11-05 23:55:34,Would not connect PRIME,app worked fine until it made me sign up for 30 day free grubhub after the entire initiation of the order stemmed from the link through our prime membership,3
420,2239,grubhub,302920553,2022-11-05 23:55:34,Would not connect PRIME,unlikely coincidence onsidering techsavyness of both companies,3
421,2240,grubhub,302920553,2022-11-05 20:50:40,Fix the live car view already…,the live view is so terribly designed you have to have it open for at least 20 seconds before you get a somewhat accurate location of the driver,2
421,2241,grubhub,302920553,2022-11-05 20:50:40,Fix the live car view already…,even then it is still way behind,2
422,2242,grubhub,302920553,2022-09-30 16:50:34,Smooth operating UI,have not used gh in years using it for the first time sort of was just so darn easypop up and down arrows made sense,5
422,2243,grubhub,302920553,2022-09-30 16:50:34,Smooth operating UI,nailed it,5
423,2244,grubhub,302920553,2022-10-23 02:12:52,Terrible,apparently the delivery drivers take orders and only deliver them if they feel like it,1
423,2245,grubhub,302920553,2022-10-23 02:12:52,Terrible,multiple times the driver did not bother to pick up the order leaving us wondering if we were going to get our food or figure something else out,1
423,2246,grubhub,302920553,2022-10-23 02:12:52,Terrible,i deleted the app and will not be using the service again,1
424,2247,grubhub,302920553,2022-10-18 01:51:14,Incompetent drivers,i have never in my entire life left a review on an app but i just have to express my disappointment,1
424,2248,grubhub,302920553,2022-10-18 01:51:14,Incompetent drivers,on two different occasions my food was dropped off at the wrong house,1
424,2249,grubhub,302920553,2022-10-18 01:51:14,Incompetent drivers,my house is not difficult to find and the instructions are as clear as day,1
424,2250,grubhub,302920553,2022-10-18 01:51:14,Incompetent drivers,i understand that no one is to blame but that does not lessen my frustration,1
425,2251,grubhub,302920553,2022-10-15 00:24:01,Begging for review,i am sick of apps asking for my review i have yet to run into a app that works perfect and does not cost me money,1
425,2252,grubhub,302920553,2022-10-15 00:24:01,Begging for review,grub hub jacks up the food prices and adds on fees plus their monthly charge to have access to the plus features,1
425,2253,grubhub,302920553,2022-10-15 00:24:01,Begging for review,for those that want delivery and do not mind way overpaying for the convenience,1
425,2254,grubhub,302920553,2022-10-15 00:24:01,Begging for review,so yes since this how these apps are one star it is,1
426,2255,grubhub,302920553,2022-09-25 02:28:55,Did NOT give me proper Coupon,this service did not give me a 25 coupon off for my first order,5
426,2256,grubhub,302920553,2022-09-25 02:28:55,Did NOT give me proper Coupon,this is the only reason i used this app,5
426,2257,grubhub,302920553,2022-09-25 02:28:55,Did NOT give me proper Coupon,will never be using this grubhub a g a i n,5
427,2259,grubhub,302920553,2022-09-19 16:17:55,First Timer,ordered through grubhub for the very first time last night and the whole process was seamlessly smooth and pleasant,5
427,2260,grubhub,302920553,2022-09-19 16:17:55,First Timer,the transparency of each component of my order and cost the transport component with the driver and the estimated time of delivery was flawless and uplifting i am definitely a believer and keeper with grubhub and will order through them again in the near future,5
427,2261,grubhub,302920553,2022-09-19 16:17:55,First Timer,blessings and shalom,5
428,2263,grubhub,302920553,2022-09-19 00:25:20,Oder never arrived and was not refunded,my order never arrived and i was not given the option to contact the driver after it said it was delivered,1
428,2264,grubhub,302920553,2022-09-19 00:25:20,Oder never arrived and was not refunded,i contacted customer service and they said they would give me a refund but they just gave me credit for the app but not equal to the amount i spent on the incomplete order,1
428,2265,grubhub,302920553,2022-09-19 00:25:20,Oder never arrived and was not refunded,overall really disappointed and hangry,1
429,2266,grubhub,302920553,2022-12-10 03:05:57,Taj on wheels,i am not a super fan of indian food but this food was incredible,5

430,2269,grubhub,302920553,2022-12-19 17:05:57,Food almost always late,it is ok but they have drivers that deliver to complete opposite locations of where you are pretty frequently so your food is cold and will need some microwaving,2
430,2270,grubhub,302920553,2022-12-19 17:05:57,Food almost always late,on average add 2030 minutes on to the original estimate,2
430,2271,grubhub,302920553,2022-12-19 17:05:57,Food almost always late,they charge a lot for service fees and delivery fees to get cold food delivered,2
431,2272,grubhub,302920553,2022-11-12 21:59:06,Easy,the process of finding and ordering what i want is fast and simple no matter where i am,5
432,2273,grubhub,302920553,2022-12-08 17:27:11,Mis delivered,seems no matter how detailed the instructions are to get to my door they always take my food to the wrong place,1
432,2274,grubhub,302920553,2022-12-08 17:27:11,Mis delivered,one driver even left the food at the curbside,1
432,2275,grubhub,302920553,2022-12-08 17:27:11,Mis delivered,i only use them because i am disabled,1
432,2276,grubhub,302920553,2022-12-08 17:27:11,Mis delivered,but they asked me to walk around and see if i could find the food instead of getting on the driverdelivery person,1
433,2277,grubhub,302920553,2022-11-24 02:21:57,Plz use any other service,grubhub does not care about their customers or how good their drivers are,1
433,2278,grubhub,302920553,2022-11-24 02:21:57,Plz use any other service,the driver brought me someone elses order so i got a refund and ordered again,1
433,2279,grubhub,302920553,2022-11-24 02:21:57,Plz use any other service,the driver then brought me my original order,1
433,2280,grubhub,302920553,2022-11-24 02:21:57,Plz use any other service,some of the boxes had clearly been opened and it was cold,1
433,2281,grubhub,302920553,2022-11-24 02:21:57,Plz use any other service,i never got the new order i placed,1
433,2282,grubhub,302920553,2022-11-24 02:21:57,Plz use any other service,tried to refund but it never went through,1
434,2284,grubhub,302920553,2022-11-14 01:10:45,Won't Let Me Order,i have tried ordering via the browser and the app,1
434,2285,grubhub,302920553,2022-11-14 01:10:45,Won't Let Me Order,i guess technology is not their strength which is scary considering it is the basis of their business,1
434,2286,grubhub,302920553,2022-11-14 01:10:45,Won't Let Me Order,it just keeps refunding me and say that my order was cancelled but never says why,1
434,2287,grubhub,302920553,2022-11-14 01:10:45,Won't Let Me Order,it happens for any restaurant we choose,1
434,2288,grubhub,302920553,2022-11-14 01:10:45,Won't Let Me Order,do not use if you actually want to eat,1
435,2289,grubhub,302920553,2022-10-13 17:07:09,App is easy,love this app i like being able to find the specials,5
435,2290,grubhub,302920553,2022-10-13 17:07:09,App is easy,keeps me saving money and trying new restaurants,5
436,2291,grubhub,302920553,2022-10-31 01:11:28,Not good,i do not know what is wrong with them lately but i seem to never get my whole order recently,1
436,2292,grubhub,302920553,2022-10-31 01:11:28,Not good,i ordered for my family and only received food for one or two leaving the rest of the family with no food,1
436,2293,grubhub,302920553,2022-10-31 01:11:28,Not good,when i contact the drivers i am told that is all they were given,1
436,2294,grubhub,302920553,2022-10-31 01:11:28,Not good,so either the drivers are stealing the food or the restaurants are not getting the full orders,1
436,2295,grubhub,302920553,2022-10-31 01:11:28,Not good,i am betting that grubhub is not getting the full orders to the restaurant otherwise how is a 70 order only two small food itemsthey offered a refund but what i want is what i paid for,1
436,2296,grubhub,302920553,2022-10-31 01:11:28,Not good,do not recommend using,1

439,2301,grubhub,302920553,2022-09-18 00:15:41,Now with more fees!,and now all the businesses have service fees in addition to delivery fees and driver tip,2
439,2302,grubhub,302920553,2022-09-18 00:15:41,Now with more fees!,i will save myself the extra 15 and pick up my own food at that point,2
440,2303,grubhub,302920553,2022-12-03 00:18:03,At Woolf Realty,we use the service all the time for lunch and dinner at home 95 of the time everythings the way it should be in on time,5
441,2304,grubhub,302920553,2022-12-16 22:29:46,It's a great resource but way to pricey,i do not mind paying someone to pick up and deliver my food but all the little fees or subscription add up and it is a bit ridiculous,4
442,2305,grubhub,302920553,2022-11-28 02:39:07,Not great,my issue is that the delivery drivers never follow the directions has i put them in the system,2
442,2306,grubhub,302920553,2022-11-28 02:39:07,Not great,i never want my food left on the door step,2
442,2307,grubhub,302920553,2022-11-28 02:39:07,Not great,it is crap customer service and when ever you try to talk to somebody about any issue it never works out,2
443,2308,grubhub,302920553,2022-11-19 20:52:31,Customer service and security is a JOKE,someone hacked my account and changed emailpw,1

443,2311,grubhub,302920553,2022-11-19 20:52:31,Customer service and security is a JOKE,so i no longer have a grubhub account,1

449,2332,grubhub,302920553,2022-12-04 23:38:11,Mediocre,other than that it is a delivery service,3
450,2333,grubhub,302920553,2022-11-02 00:06:35,Got Banned From DD,i am not sure how but got completely banned from doordash,5
450,2334,grubhub,302920553,2022-11-02 00:06:35,Got Banned From DD,tried this,5
450,2335,grubhub,302920553,2022-11-02 00:06:35,Got Banned From DD,just got my first order pretty well done pretty cheap,5
451,2336,grubhub,302920553,2022-10-30 03:00:00,Free delivery promo not true for all restaurants,app is fine but there are restrictions to free delivery promo,3
451,2337,grubhub,302920553,2022-10-30 03:00:00,Free delivery promo not true for all restaurants,some restaurants not included which is disappointing,3
451,2338,grubhub,302920553,2022-10-30 03:00:00,Free delivery promo not true for all restaurants,there is no explanation or even a requirement set for minimum purchase,3
451,2339,grubhub,302920553,2022-10-30 03:00:00,Free delivery promo not true for all restaurants,i rather tip the driver that money so i chose another restaurant,3
452,2340,grubhub,302920553,2022-10-27 18:22:38,Way too easy to pick the wrong address,there are a few duplicate addresses in my city and the interface makes it way too easy to select the wrong one then if the driver does not answer their phone they cannot change the address,1
452,2341,grubhub,302920553,2022-10-27 18:22:38,Way too easy to pick the wrong address,literally any other app is better,1
453,2342,grubhub,302920553,2022-10-07 07:57:46,Needs enhancement,so i can favorite restaurants but why the eff cannot we also favorite items on their menu,3
453,2343,grubhub,302920553,2022-10-07 07:57:46,Needs enhancement,it would make ordering our favorite items extremely easier,3
454,2344,grubhub,302920553,2022-09-23 22:42:32,More options please,just wish there were more options especially coffee,4

456,2347,grubhub,302920553,2022-12-17 18:57:00,Terrible Customer Service,i hate that i have to talk to someone to cancel my order by the time someone is able to help me they have already started working on my order and now i have to pay a fee if i want to cancel,1
456,2348,grubhub,302920553,2022-12-17 18:57:00,Terrible Customer Service,why cannot the just use an automated system at least they work faster,1
457,2349,grubhub,302920553,2022-12-16 21:54:37,"Hacked account, no support",my account like many others was hacked,1
457,2350,grubhub,302920553,2022-12-16 21:54:37,"Hacked account, no support",i got charges to my bank and had to cancel my card,1
457,2351,grubhub,302920553,2022-12-16 21:54:37,"Hacked account, no support",there was no customer support from grubhub and i already favored all of the other delivery options,1
457,2352,grubhub,302920553,2022-12-16 21:54:37,"Hacked account, no support",if you see this message just stick with uber eats or doordash,1
457,2353,grubhub,302920553,2022-12-16 21:54:37,"Hacked account, no support",do some research for alternatives and dont get this app,1
458,2354,grubhub,302920553,2022-12-10 20:31:53,Bad service,first time using the app place an order of more than 75 dollars for my family lunch 20 min before the order arrived i received an email saying order cancel your redound to your card within 5 business days this is beyond unacceptable they kept my money for 5 days and left me without lunch,1
459,2355,grubhub,302920553,2022-12-06 02:01:45,Why,foodler was better also you cannot put specific notes on restaurants and dishes to specifically recall what you liked and why also the programming seems to steer you away from where you want to order from  instead to some programmed algorithm of where grubhub wants you to order from,1
460,2356,grubhub,302920553,2022-11-27 22:21:06,You won't take my money,tried to order 4 times from 4 different places,1
460,2357,grubhub,302920553,2022-11-27 22:21:06,You won't take my money,every time the order could not be completed for reasons unknown,1
460,2358,grubhub,302920553,2022-11-27 22:21:06,You won't take my money,clicked a 5th restaurant to order but instead of taking me to the menu it redirected to home page,1
460,2359,grubhub,302920553,2022-11-27 22:21:06,You won't take my money,i wanted to give you my money at first but decided 5th strike,1

463,2373,grubhub,302920553,2022-10-26 23:09:42,Worst one to use,i has a free tripa for grubhub plus,1
463,2374,grubhub,302920553,2022-10-26 23:09:42,Worst one to use,my very first order was 40 minutes late,1
463,2375,grubhub,302920553,2022-10-26 23:09:42,Worst one to use,i only received half my meal and none of my sons meal,1
463,2376,grubhub,302920553,2022-10-26 23:09:42,Worst one to use,and i tried to use my free trial today w my order being 15,1
463,2377,grubhub,302920553,2022-10-26 23:09:42,Worst one to use,they cancelled it,1
463,2378,grubhub,302920553,2022-10-26 23:09:42,Worst one to use,revoked my free trial and then my order was now 21 to process,1
463,2379,grubhub,302920553,2022-10-26 23:09:42,Worst one to use,which was successful of course,1
463,2380,grubhub,302920553,2022-10-26 23:09:42,Worst one to use,i should have stuck to uber eats,1
463,2381,grubhub,302920553,2022-10-26 23:09:42,Worst one to use,learn from my mistake,1
464,2382,grubhub,302920553,2022-09-22 01:18:24,Grubhub+,grubhub  is very misleading,3
464,2383,grubhub,302920553,2022-09-22 01:18:24,Grubhub+,i go to school at osu and get grubhub  for free,3
464,2384,grubhub,302920553,2022-09-22 01:18:24,Grubhub+,which includes free delivery,3
464,2385,grubhub,302920553,2022-09-22 01:18:24,Grubhub+,you have to spend nearly 20 to get the free delivery and even then you are not guaranteed free delivery,3
464,2386,grubhub,302920553,2022-09-22 01:18:24,Grubhub+,it is very annoying when i only want one 6 meal but have to pay 13 for it,3
465,2387,grubhub,302920553,2022-09-17 17:27:48,My order was so late!,i placed my order and it would be here in 2530 minutes which was fine,1
465,2388,grubhub,302920553,2022-09-17 17:27:48,My order was so late!,but my food arrival got pushed back three times that it took over 2 hours to get here and it never did,1

467,2392,grubhub,302920553,2022-12-14 19:33:25,Terrible drivers,they need to get better drivers,1
467,2393,grubhub,302920553,2022-12-14 19:33:25,Terrible drivers,the amount of times i have had to request a refund because a driver forgot an item or dropped the food at the wrong location is insane,1
467,2394,grubhub,302920553,2022-12-14 19:33:25,Terrible drivers,there is never any proof either that they dropped it off at the right location,1
467,2395,grubhub,302920553,2022-12-14 19:33:25,Terrible drivers,ubereats is better,1
468,2396,grubhub,302920553,2022-10-23 20:43:36,Will never use them again!,i am done with these guysi have used them for years and every once in awhile they would forget an item now it is happening every timei asked for them to deliver the food that was missing since i already paid the obscene fees and charges but they will only do a refund then when it came to a refund they would not give it to me because of too many complaints how the f is that my fault,1
468,2397,grubhub,302920553,2022-10-23 20:43:36,Will never use them again!,so i told them i will never use them again and the customer service manager said she did not care really,1
468,2398,grubhub,302920553,2022-10-23 20:43:36,Will never use them again!,i spend on average 1200 a month with them so i guess that is not enoughbye,1

470,2404,grubhub,302920553,2022-09-14 12:43:26,Charge Too Much,delivery apps like this will milk you for any extra penny you have,1
470,2405,grubhub,302920553,2022-09-14 12:43:26,Charge Too Much,great app to save time if you cannot walk the extra 5 miles to go to these restaurants horrible app for saving money you might as well walk,1
470,2406,grubhub,302920553,2022-09-14 12:43:26,Charge Too Much,nobody is paying you to use this app so why pay grubhub to save money only to spend even more,1
471,2407,grubhub,302920553,2022-12-20 23:41:44,Don't waste your money,even with grubhub pro and a 12 tip for food from a restaurant 2 miles away the delivery person is now on the other side of town 10 miles away delivering another order before mine because that totally makes sense,1
471,2408,grubhub,302920553,2022-12-20 23:41:44,Don't waste your money,if you enjoy wasting your money for cold food look no further,1

477,2421,grubhub,302920553,2022-09-28 04:39:46,Could be better,it is not but these people care,5
477,2422,grubhub,302920553,2022-09-28 04:39:46,Could be better,let them prove you wrong for us they have proven valiente,5
478,2423,grubhub,302920553,2022-09-29 21:37:44,Few Menu Options,not a lot of menu choices,2
478,2424,grubhub,302920553,2022-09-29 21:37:44,Few Menu Options,does not offer a lot of normal menu options that are on multiple restaurants menus and are available for delivery with other delivery services,2

480,2429,grubhub,302920553,2022-09-24 15:01:31,Worst app and service,i send messages through the customer service chat and there is a bug as soon as they respond i automatically get a message saying that i did not respond and they close the chat,1
481,2430,grubhub,302920553,2022-12-12 23:05:35,Tipping is not quite right,defaults to 25 which is incredible in its own right but they also calculate tip based on the total after taxes and fees,4
481,2431,grubhub,302920553,2022-12-12 23:05:35,Tipping is not quite right,tips are supposed to be calculated based on the subtotal,4
482,2432,grubhub,302920553,2022-10-31 03:14:13,Horrible service,horrible delivery drivers who leave your food where ever without contacting you and horrible customer service when you call or use their chat,1
482,2433,grubhub,302920553,2022-10-31 03:14:13,Horrible service,problem keeps happening again and again and they never help or really do anything,1
483,2434,grubhub,302920553,2022-10-12 18:07:20,"High fees, limited options",service fees are much higher than other delivery apps,3
483,2435,grubhub,302920553,2022-10-12 18:07:20,"High fees, limited options",also there are less dininglocation options available,3
484,2436,grubhub,302920553,2022-10-01 19:22:28,Zero customer service,this literally happened1 i ordered food2 app said it was delivered but food never came3 customer service says they contacted the driver and he dropped off food in my front door4 they offered to refund or reorder,1
484,2437,grubhub,302920553,2022-10-01 19:22:28,Zero customer service,i asked to reorder,1

484,2440,grubhub,302920553,2022-10-01 19:22:28,Zero customer service,6 all they offer is 10 discount on next order,1
484,2441,grubhub,302920553,2022-10-01 19:22:28,Zero customer service,for a 2hour wait with no food at the end of it7 i am deleting this app,1
484,2442,grubhub,302920553,2022-10-01 19:22:28,Zero customer service,so many options in this space,1
485,2443,grubhub,302920553,2022-09-22 23:39:58,Only game in town,with where i live it is the only way to get any quality food delivered,2
485,2444,grubhub,302920553,2022-09-22 23:39:58,Only game in town,i have noticed we are getting charged a delivery on top of a service fee and that just does not sit well with me,2
485,2445,grubhub,302920553,2022-09-22 23:39:58,Only game in town,but i guess it is my own fault for not planning a supper in advance,2
486,2446,grubhub,302920553,2022-09-21 16:32:08,Probably will try again - pretty good,good empanadas only came with two of the three sauces advertised and one of those barely had a coating of the sauce on the bottom of the cup,4
487,2447,grubhub,302920553,2022-12-14 00:11:41,Grubhub,great app they get back to when there is a problem great prices i recommend this over any delivery app,5
488,2448,grubhub,302920553,2022-11-05 14:57:21,Wish it weren't so expensive though,but grateful for the service,5
489,2449,grubhub,302920553,2022-11-09 23:42:09,Terrible delivery and App,i feel awful for any restaurant trying to work with grubhub,1
489,2450,grubhub,302920553,2022-11-09 23:42:09,Terrible delivery and App,constant delivery issues and only using because we received a gift card,1
489,2451,grubhub,302920553,2022-11-09 23:42:09,Terrible delivery and App,and it was extremely confusing and time consuming to use gift card,1
489,2452,grubhub,302920553,2022-11-09 23:42:09,Terrible delivery and App,what does it matterapple will not post this anyways,1

503,2535,ubereats,1058959277,2022-11-30 15:05:49,Thanks for letting me get robbed multiple times and refusing to help,so i do not recommend this app at all honestly i do not recommend any of these delivery apps doordash allows too many thefts ubereats refuses to listen to their customers and grubhub is ridiculously expensive,1
504,2536,ubereats,1058959277,2022-11-26 23:18:08,Totally disappointed,this app worked fine for a while then it started to involve some operations that failed the customer satisfaction for sure,2
504,2537,ubereats,1058959277,2022-11-26 23:18:08,Totally disappointed,i just ordered a dinner a couple of days ago and everything was just fine until minutes after the order was placed and almost ready to deliver,2
504,2538,ubereats,1058959277,2022-11-26 23:18:08,Totally disappointed,so it happened that i opened the app to check order status and my order was canceled and the stated argument was that i called the restaurant to cancel the order over phone,2
504,2539,ubereats,1058959277,2022-11-26 23:18:08,Totally disappointed,besides that uber customer service told me when chatting that they were sorry and my  cannot be refunded because i have canceled too many orders recently which was totally false and not demonstrated,2
504,2540,ubereats,1058959277,2022-11-26 23:18:08,Totally disappointed,then 1 how is it possible that uber may allow a customer to cancel and order over phone that he placed online through the app instead of canceling using the app and 2 how is that you can tell me i will not receive full refund for a nondemonstrated action,2
504,2541,ubereats,1058959277,2022-11-26 23:18:08,Totally disappointed,guys you need to improve your operations or if this continues happening you will totally lost many clients,2
504,2542,ubereats,1058959277,2022-11-26 23:18:08,Totally disappointed,i uninstalled the app and hope to find some other new app or an entrepreneur who can do a little better with less complications because this is a difficult time to waste  for no good reason,2
504,2543,ubereats,1058959277,2022-11-26 23:18:08,Totally disappointed,i better call straight to the restaurant and make my order than handle my  to such an irresponsible entity,2
505,2544,ubereats,1058959277,2022-12-12 15:55:05,Refund,so as of today i deleted this app and i am no longer giving my business to uber for them to steal from me,1
505,2545,ubereats,1058959277,2022-12-12 15:55:05,Refund,i ordered an item from a restaurant mangos grill keller but on the same day i decided to cancel it and order something else from the same restaurant,1
505,2546,ubereats,1058959277,2022-12-12 15:55:05,Refund,upon my cancellation the app told me it would be a standard 47 business days for my refund to be processed so i was alright waiting but it was already 5 days and i had not received my refund so i decided to follow up and see what the hold up was just for uber to transfer me over and over and end up not resolving my issue just to receive an email that i was not eligible for a refund,1
505,2547,ubereats,1058959277,2022-12-12 15:55:05,Refund,i tried to call and a customer service agent from uber notifies me that because it was past 48hrs of me contacting uber about my refund that they would not issue it back to me because they have procedures in place to be followed,1
505,2548,ubereats,1058959277,2022-12-12 15:55:05,Refund,i am not going to get my refund because i followed the process that the app told me to but apparently i was supposed to call uber to cancel the order for me,1
505,2549,ubereats,1058959277,2022-12-12 15:55:05,Refund,how does this make sense,1
505,2550,ubereats,1058959277,2022-12-12 15:55:05,Refund,why are there not steps on the app then to be user friendly and also give out information about cancellation and what not,1
505,2551,ubereats,1058959277,2022-12-12 15:55:05,Refund,this app has left a bad taste in my mouth and please be careful anyone using the app,1

506,2557,ubereats,1058959277,2022-11-13 21:23:39,Wow wow wow wow,i was placing an order around the same price slightly higher than this fee which at the time i assumed it was the discount being applied like the button i clicked on said would be applied,1
506,2558,ubereats,1058959277,2022-11-13 21:23:39,Wow wow wow wow,it goes through and when i go to check my orders eta no such record of the order has been placed but the money sure has been taken out of my account,1
506,2559,ubereats,1058959277,2022-11-13 21:23:39,Wow wow wow wow,customer service pretended to check on my order then claimed they were transferring me to someone with more resources than they currently had and ended the chat with me,1
506,2560,ubereats,1058959277,2022-11-13 21:23:39,Wow wow wow wow,no transfer was made no contact was attempted,1

506,2563,ubereats,1058959277,2022-11-13 21:23:39,Wow wow wow wow,i check my email and about an hour later i get the explanation that this is an authorization fee that will be released in 310 days,1
506,2564,ubereats,1058959277,2022-11-13 21:23:39,Wow wow wow wow,it would have been better if they just said we are sorry we messed up vs the ridiculous explanation i was given,1
506,2565,ubereats,1058959277,2022-11-13 21:23:39,Wow wow wow wow,i am sure it is for legal reasons but i feel like i was politely robbed,1
507,2566,ubereats,1058959277,2022-10-21 00:52:53,Great until your order is messed up,i like the convenience of using uber eats however there is been too many times where my order was either missing items or incorrectly prepared,1
507,2567,ubereats,1058959277,2022-10-21 00:52:53,Great until your order is messed up,now in this situation of course most people will contact support for assistance to request a refund of those missing items or incorrect order,1
507,2568,ubereats,1058959277,2022-10-21 00:52:53,Great until your order is messed up,the problem with this is uber gives a cap on how much they will refund over a period of time,1
507,2569,ubereats,1058959277,2022-10-21 00:52:53,Great until your order is messed up,now i understand there is limits due to help prevent abuse but if you request a picture and description of the issue and it is provided then something should be done to help the consumer,1
507,2570,ubereats,1058959277,2022-10-21 00:52:53,Great until your order is messed up,say i ordered a chicken sandwich and received a hamburger and i clearly show that i received something different then saying you cannot provide a refund and you you will reach out to the merchant to help prevent it from happening again does not help the consumer,1
507,2571,ubereats,1058959277,2022-10-21 00:52:53,Great until your order is messed up,this penalizes the consumer and makes them less likely to use the service again due to something outside of their controlsome people spend a lot of money on delivery food to have food missing or incorrectly prepared food only to be stuck with no solution from the service provider,1
507,2572,ubereats,1058959277,2022-10-21 00:52:53,Great until your order is messed up,i nearly signed up for an annual subscription i am soooo glad i did not,1
507,2573,ubereats,1058959277,2022-10-21 00:52:53,Great until your order is messed up,be careful for anyone that does sign up for the annual plan to save money,1
507,2574,ubereats,1058959277,2022-10-21 00:52:53,Great until your order is messed up,once you reach your cap on support you will not get any more assistance with messed up orders,1
508,2575,ubereats,1058959277,2022-11-19 23:15:04,So many bugs,i wrote this review a year and a half ago,1
508,2576,ubereats,1058959277,2022-11-19 23:15:04,So many bugs,i still cannot understand for the life of me why this broken app gets anywhere near 5 stars,1
508,2577,ubereats,1058959277,2022-11-19 23:15:04,So many bugs,even the bad reviews have five stars,1
508,2578,ubereats,1058959277,2022-11-19 23:15:04,So many bugs,i am at a loss,1
508,2579,ubereats,1058959277,2022-11-19 23:15:04,So many bugs,this time i came back to point out that they removed the option to add a note of instructions,1
508,2580,ubereats,1058959277,2022-11-19 23:15:04,So many bugs,now i cannot tell them to hold the lettuce,1
508,2581,ubereats,1058959277,2022-11-19 23:15:04,So many bugs,maybe it is all the people in the us because uber would rather invade and colonialize latin america than actually try to fix their app,1
508,2582,ubereats,1058959277,2022-11-19 23:15:04,So many bugs,it is well and truly baffling that they get this much praise,1
508,2583,ubereats,1058959277,2022-11-19 23:15:04,So many bugs,one example is that the app cannot figure out where i am nor where places are,1
508,2584,ubereats,1058959277,2022-11-19 23:15:04,So many bugs,either it puts the delivery guy a block away and does not let me fix the location or the application simply changes the location to somewhere i am not,1
508,2585,ubereats,1058959277,2022-11-19 23:15:04,So many bugs,i literally had to add a location in google maps and name it as if it were my own business in order to get them to come to that point on the map,1
508,2586,ubereats,1058959277,2022-11-19 23:15:04,So many bugs,worse yet it is profoundly frustrating that there is no in app support or chat the only possible place i have ever gotten a single helpful response is on twitter,1
508,2587,ubereats,1058959277,2022-11-19 23:15:04,So many bugs,twitter is a social media application not a support platform and now it is been tanked by elon,1
508,2588,ubereats,1058959277,2022-11-19 23:15:04,So many bugs,i guess when you manage to undercut everyone out of the market and secure the back pockets of politicians through us imperialism and begin dominating the industry you have zero incentive to fix anything or provide support,1
509,2589,ubereats,1058959277,2022-12-20 11:46:45,Scammer drivers one click away,my large taco order to help a friend who was running low on food at his party was never delivered,1

509,2591,ubereats,1058959277,2022-12-20 11:46:45,Scammer drivers one click away,then all of a sudden the app alerts me that the food was delivered,1
509,2592,ubereats,1058959277,2022-12-20 11:46:45,Scammer drivers one click away,uhhh no,1
509,2593,ubereats,1058959277,2022-12-20 11:46:45,Scammer drivers one click away,i am pacing the front yard in the subfreezing weather to ensure a quick handoff,1
509,2594,ubereats,1058959277,2022-12-20 11:46:45,Scammer drivers one click away,not a car in sight,1
509,2595,ubereats,1058959277,2022-12-20 11:46:45,Scammer drivers one click away,using the apps map  i saw the driver ryan about 2 blocks away,1
509,2596,ubereats,1058959277,2022-12-20 11:46:45,Scammer drivers one click away,i frantically tried to call him via the app but after multiple attempts was never able to get thru,1
509,2597,ubereats,1058959277,2022-12-20 11:46:45,Scammer drivers one click away,as soon as i heard ringing the call would be disconnected,1
509,2598,ubereats,1058959277,2022-12-20 11:46:45,Scammer drivers one click away,over and over again that was my experience,1
509,2599,ubereats,1058959277,2022-12-20 11:46:45,Scammer drivers one click away,then the order in the app converted to delivered and that is that,1
509,2600,ubereats,1058959277,2022-12-20 11:46:45,Scammer drivers one click away,i kept trying to call and searched for helpful menu options which were limited until i suppose even uber fatigued and suddenly presented me with a refund option that was not there before,1
509,2601,ubereats,1058959277,2022-12-20 11:46:45,Scammer drivers one click away,i requested a refund but only the food cost was refunded,1
509,2602,ubereats,1058959277,2022-12-20 11:46:45,Scammer drivers one click away,the driver happily cruised away with a tip and presumably 24 tacos,1
509,2603,ubereats,1058959277,2022-12-20 11:46:45,Scammer drivers one click away,needless to say the party guests were shocked at how easy it was to be scammed by an uber eats driver with no repercussions,1
509,2604,ubereats,1058959277,2022-12-20 11:46:45,Scammer drivers one click away,i am done with uber eats until i hear they have scamming under controlfrankly even refunding the tip is not enough,1
509,2605,ubereats,1058959277,2022-12-20 11:46:45,Scammer drivers one click away,the stress and hassle and embarrassment of chasing down the driver via the app only tor walk back inside empty handed is not worth it,1
510,2606,ubereats,1058959277,2022-11-27 18:57:13,Buyers beware,received a promo for 30 off a grocery delivery,2
510,2607,ubereats,1058959277,2022-11-27 18:57:13,Buyers beware,i was curious to compare using the grocers app,2
510,2608,ubereats,1058959277,2022-11-27 18:57:13,Buyers beware,tldr uber eats was more expensive than going through the grocers app even after the promo,2
510,2609,ubereats,1058959277,2022-11-27 18:57:13,Buyers beware,all the prices were about 30 cents more expensive on uber eats,2
510,2610,ubereats,1058959277,2022-11-27 18:57:13,Buyers beware,i created the same delivery order in the grocerys app and the total after taxes and hidden fees about 15 on uber came to 6 less compared to uber eats and that included a 20 tip where the uber eats total did not so it would have been even more expensive,2
510,2611,ubereats,1058959277,2022-11-27 18:57:13,Buyers beware,note there was no promo used on the grocers app other than automatically applied coupons,2
510,2612,ubereats,1058959277,2022-11-27 18:57:13,Buyers beware,the odd thing is i am pretty sure the grocer still goes through uber eats for delivery,2
510,2613,ubereats,1058959277,2022-11-27 18:57:13,Buyers beware,perhaps it is door dash crazy how an order on uber eats with 30 in promo credits costed more for the same items before adding a tip,2
510,2614,ubereats,1058959277,2022-11-27 18:57:13,Buyers beware,additionally this cost comparison would still hold true even if i got an uber eats membership which would have saved an additional 7 unless i did not tip on uber eats for a total savings of 1 which is lost to the membership fee,2
510,2615,ubereats,1058959277,2022-11-27 18:57:13,Buyers beware,i will go with the grocers app that also automatically applies various coupons and free pickup if desired,2
510,2616,ubereats,1058959277,2022-11-27 18:57:13,Buyers beware,the promo appears to be misleading and could trick customers who might not be aware of alternatives so 25 for the deceptive practice,2
511,2617,ubereats,1058959277,2022-09-16 17:34:37,Support will scam you,i signed up for the plus membership which promises free delivery on most places,1
511,2618,ubereats,1058959277,2022-09-16 17:34:37,Support will scam you,when browsing places to eat i found one that had the plus membership symbol and stated free delivery,1
511,2619,ubereats,1058959277,2022-09-16 17:34:37,Support will scam you,however at checkout i was being charged a delivery fee,1
511,2620,ubereats,1058959277,2022-09-16 17:34:37,Support will scam you,i spoke to a support rep and supplied them with pictures of the app stating no delivery fee on the front page and also at checkout where one was being applied,1
511,2621,ubereats,1058959277,2022-09-16 17:34:37,Support will scam you,the rep assured me that the way it works is that i will be refunded the delivery fee once the delivery has been completed,1
511,2622,ubereats,1058959277,2022-09-16 17:34:37,Support will scam you,i voiced my confusion with such a business model to which they just kept reassuring me i could place my order and i would be getting my money back,1
511,2623,ubereats,1058959277,2022-09-16 17:34:37,Support will scam you,it has been a week since and i was never refunded so i contacted a rep over the phone this time to which they told me the initial rep was wrong and i will not be getting my money back,1
511,2624,ubereats,1058959277,2022-09-16 17:34:37,Support will scam you,i then asked to speak to a higher up as they now scammed me into placing an order that i told them i would not be ordering if i had to pay the delivery fee since it was almost as much as the order itself,1
511,2625,ubereats,1058959277,2022-09-16 17:34:37,Support will scam you,the new rep assured me their supervisor would contact me by the end of the night,1
511,2626,ubereats,1058959277,2022-09-16 17:34:37,Support will scam you,that was 3 days ago,1
511,2627,ubereats,1058959277,2022-09-16 17:34:37,Support will scam you,i even saved the chat log and would gladly supply it to them if they actually bothered to contact me,1
511,2628,ubereats,1058959277,2022-09-16 17:34:37,Support will scam you,i will not be ordering from this service again scammers,1

512,2643,ubereats,1058959277,2022-10-29 19:21:22,No refund on stale food,but this time it is quite frustrating as the support manager says that they cannot give a refund this time as it will be not fair for everyone using the app,1
512,2644,ubereats,1058959277,2022-10-29 19:21:22,No refund on stale food,i did not understand,1
512,2645,ubereats,1058959277,2022-10-29 19:21:22,No refund on stale food,my simple concern was why should i pay for a food which is stale,1
512,2646,ubereats,1058959277,2022-10-29 19:21:22,No refund on stale food,is it fair for a customer,1

512,2651,ubereats,1058959277,2022-10-29 19:21:22,No refund on stale food,so is it about the offers,1

513,2653,ubereats,1058959277,2022-11-10 14:51:49,Borderline scam artists,i have been an uber customer for 78 years now,1
513,2654,ubereats,1058959277,2022-11-10 14:51:49,Borderline scam artists,am an uber one member for years now also,1
513,2655,ubereats,1058959277,2022-11-10 14:51:49,Borderline scam artists,am always grateful and appreciative and share the same,1
513,2656,ubereats,1058959277,2022-11-10 14:51:49,Borderline scam artists,until a couple weeks ago when my order was processed without proper promo,1
513,2657,ubereats,1058959277,2022-11-10 14:51:49,Borderline scam artists,so i cancelled the order right away and then processed a 2nd order with the exact same items just with promo also being included properly,1
513,2658,ubereats,1058959277,2022-11-10 14:51:49,Borderline scam artists,uber then allowed the restaurant to charge me for 2 orders stating they had started my first and had lost the food from it which was totally nonsense from the beginning,1
513,2659,ubereats,1058959277,2022-11-10 14:51:49,Borderline scam artists,i figured given my thousands of uber trips and maybe close to 1000 uber eats orders that i have placed and never once had complained for no reason and this case is even clearer seeing as i ordered exact same items maybe 23 mins later and had no problem paying for them,1
513,2660,ubereats,1058959277,2022-11-10 14:51:49,Borderline scam artists,went thru uber support and was actually told by uber employee that i was going to be credited for first bogus charge,1
513,2661,ubereats,1058959277,2022-11-10 14:51:49,Borderline scam artists,then few minutes later i receive a separate message that stated that no they were not going to make this right and that i have no recourse,1
513,2662,ubereats,1058959277,2022-11-10 14:51:49,Borderline scam artists,meanwhile like i said thousands of uber rides and a 49 star gold member and this is way i have been treated,1
513,2663,ubereats,1058959277,2022-11-10 14:51:49,Borderline scam artists,uber is total disappointment and should be ashamed of themselves,1
514,2664,ubereats,1058959277,2022-11-30 01:31:42,"I don't like Uber eats, but I will still use it. It's not a bad app.",like i was reading some of the comments and i decided to take matters into my own hands and where did cabbage all right these prices are rou too high and like these prices need to go down because like there is no way this is like it is not like you are like high top stare at it so high top quality yeah i make it seem like that you all deserve all this money,4

521,2739,ubereats,1058959277,2022-12-02 14:28:32,Terrible Customer Service,i was charged a cancellation fee worth 23 of the order because the app did not update my location when i changed states and i had to cancel an order immediately after making it less than 15 seconds because it was going to the wrong state,2
521,2740,ubereats,1058959277,2022-12-02 14:28:32,Terrible Customer Service,first agent gave me vague excuses about technical difficulties and ended the chat,2
521,2741,ubereats,1058959277,2022-12-02 14:28:32,Terrible Customer Service,second agent assured me that the entire charge was a temporary hold,2
521,2742,ubereats,1058959277,2022-12-02 14:28:32,Terrible Customer Service,contacted third agent because i was still charged and they told me contrary to the second agent that i was charged because the restaurant had already started the order,2
521,2743,ubereats,1058959277,2022-12-02 14:28:32,Terrible Customer Service,at the very least uber needs to address the inconsistency,2
521,2744,ubereats,1058959277,2022-12-02 14:28:32,Terrible Customer Service,moreover if their system is truly so sensitive that an order can be irrevocably locked in as soon as the order is submitted they either need better safeguards in the app or better integrated systems with the restaurants to prevent a trivial mistake like forgetting to change an address at checkout from costing the entire cost of the food,2
521,2745,ubereats,1058959277,2022-12-02 14:28:32,Terrible Customer Service,i understand paying for the cost of the users mistake to the company but the one i was charged was outlandish relative to the mistake,2
522,2746,ubereats,1058959277,2022-11-21 21:22:56,Refund Polocy,i have always enjoyed using uber eats though today i ordered like a 35 dollar order,2

522,2748,ubereats,1058959277,2022-11-21 21:22:56,Refund Polocy,when i ordered i did not think about tip,2
522,2749,ubereats,1058959277,2022-11-21 21:22:56,Refund Polocy,though i like to tip low then go back and change it afterwards depending on their service,2
522,2750,ubereats,1058959277,2022-11-21 21:22:56,Refund Polocy,i tipped a dollar today planning to tip more after i got my food but never received my order,2
522,2751,ubereats,1058959277,2022-11-21 21:22:56,Refund Polocy,i was there when it said delivered in the place i asked her to take the food and she is weirdly enough a diamond member with like a 99 good rating,2
522,2752,ubereats,1058959277,2022-11-21 21:22:56,Refund Polocy,though today i believe she took my food or threw it away or something due to low tip,2
522,2753,ubereats,1058959277,2022-11-21 21:22:56,Refund Polocy,i called her 3 times i was forwarded to voicemail after a few rings each time,2
522,2754,ubereats,1058959277,2022-11-21 21:22:56,Refund Polocy,i reached out to customer service with 3 different people and all of them said my account was not eligible due to already receiving a refund on a totally different order like 6 months ago,2
522,2755,ubereats,1058959277,2022-11-21 21:22:56,Refund Polocy,after a while i got frustrated and stopped even wanting a refund,2
522,2756,ubereats,1058959277,2022-11-21 21:22:56,Refund Polocy,i asked them if i could at least get in touch with my delivery person and see what they did with my food though she disconnected,2
522,2757,ubereats,1058959277,2022-11-21 21:22:56,Refund Polocy,horrible customer service,2
523,2758,ubereats,1058959277,2022-10-05 17:11:52,Can't get refunded,i ordered for pickup for nandos and my app autoset to another location 40 minutes away from me,1
523,2759,ubereats,1058959277,2022-10-05 17:11:52,Can't get refunded,i planned on picking up on my 30 minute lunch break to a location 5 minutes away i got to the store and they did not have my order,1
523,2760,ubereats,1058959277,2022-10-05 17:11:52,Can't get refunded,that is when i realized it was to the wrong location,1
523,2761,ubereats,1058959277,2022-10-05 17:11:52,Can't get refunded,this has happened to me before where i tried picking up but it autoset to another location it is definitely my fault for not double checking but when you are working all day and ready to get food you do not really think about worrying to see if it is the right location especially since the place i go to is only 5 minutes away,1
523,2762,ubereats,1058959277,2022-10-05 17:11:52,Can't get refunded,on the phone call with customer service i could not even hear the lady,1
523,2763,ubereats,1058959277,2022-10-05 17:11:52,Can't get refunded,it was so loud and rowdy that i could not make up on what she was saying it sounded like a party and  then she had to put me on hold,1
523,2764,ubereats,1058959277,2022-10-05 17:11:52,Can't get refunded,so at the end of all that waiting where i literally wasted 20 minutes trying to get a refund she flat out says we can cancel it but you you will be charged the full amount,1
523,2765,ubereats,1058959277,2022-10-05 17:11:52,Can't get refunded,so basically do not place orders you cannot pick up and double check the location otherwise uber will not refund you,1
523,2766,ubereats,1058959277,2022-10-05 17:11:52,Can't get refunded,total waste of money and time,1
524,2767,ubereats,1058959277,2022-11-09 02:12:01,"Multiple back to back cancellations, no one seems to care",i had 2 orders that cancel back to back and after waiting over 35 hours for delivery i get a message from uber eats on how sorry they are heres 5 for your troubleyou can call uber eats but they have no way of elevating a situation like this which i have experienced many times  customer service will apologize over and over but they can not elevate this particular situation above a low level supervisors level so top management has no way to track their own companys service,1
524,2768,ubereats,1058959277,2022-11-09 02:12:01,"Multiple back to back cancellations, no one seems to care",not the type of company i would want to invest in personal opinion only,1
524,2769,ubereats,1058959277,2022-11-09 02:12:01,"Multiple back to back cancellations, no one seems to care",i am old and no longer drive,1
524,2770,ubereats,1058959277,2022-11-09 02:12:01,"Multiple back to back cancellations, no one seems to care",i live on a fixed income so this service is extremely expensive for me,1
524,2771,ubereats,1058959277,2022-11-09 02:12:01,"Multiple back to back cancellations, no one seems to care",there are many people like me that depend on services like this,1
524,2772,ubereats,1058959277,2022-11-09 02:12:01,"Multiple back to back cancellations, no one seems to care",fortunately there are alternative service such as grub hub and door dash,1
524,2773,ubereats,1058959277,2022-11-09 02:12:01,"Multiple back to back cancellations, no one seems to care",if management responds to this review i will reevaluate my position otherwise i will not use this companys service anymore,1
524,2774,ubereats,1058959277,2022-11-09 02:12:01,"Multiple back to back cancellations, no one seems to care",check your 401k how can a company make money if the cannot track their own performance,1

537,2929,ubereats,1058959277,2022-12-10 06:16:30,Have time on your hands,you would think a refund or some type of compensation but nope they just push your latest arrival time back as if the last latest arrival time was not supposed to be the latest time your food will arrive,1
537,2930,ubereats,1058959277,2022-12-10 06:16:30,Have time on your hands,of course this comes complete with a notification letting you know the obvious that your stomach was probably telling you for an hour and a bogus apology,1

540,2958,ubereats,1058959277,2022-10-12 00:17:29,Very Bad Experience,the former does not resolve anything the latter should naturally happen anyway,1

542,2973,ubereats,1058959277,2022-10-06 21:53:20,Worst delivery ever,because my orders arrived damaged and incomplete from the grocery store after i bought nice hot pizza half hour earlier with the uber eats app,1

542,2975,ubereats,1058959277,2022-10-06 21:53:20,Worst delivery ever,secondly my milk came damaged and not fit for consumption a store is not allowed to sell bashed products,1
542,2976,ubereats,1058959277,2022-10-06 21:53:20,Worst delivery ever,milk is something ingested of all ages,1
542,2977,ubereats,1058959277,2022-10-06 21:53:20,Worst delivery ever,mariana a uber representative said there was nothing she could do as a chat customer service member and just write a review and they will learn,1

542,2981,ubereats,1058959277,2022-10-06 21:53:20,Worst delivery ever,comes to my realization now,1
542,2982,ubereats,1058959277,2022-10-06 21:53:20,Worst delivery ever,bless everyone these are the facts of using the app,1
543,2983,ubereats,1058959277,2022-10-02 04:00:25,Stop giving you refunds after a while,places consistently get my orders wrong and i always make sure to request for a refund when i receive something incorrectly i have severe food allergies so when i get an incorrect order it could be life threatening and they started telling me i will stop being able to get refunds because of requesting refunds too often,3
543,2984,ubereats,1058959277,2022-10-02 04:00:25,Stop giving you refunds after a while,it is not my fault places get my order wrong and i should be entitled to a partial refund if some of my order is wrong,3
543,2985,ubereats,1058959277,2022-10-02 04:00:25,Stop giving you refunds after a while,of course i still tip the driver and pay the rest of my order but when my order is literally inedible because of my food allergies it is not fair that i do not get a refund,3
543,2986,ubereats,1058959277,2022-10-02 04:00:25,Stop giving you refunds after a while,i guess i will stop using uber eats as much because they are punishing me for receiving the wrong order,3
543,2987,ubereats,1058959277,2022-10-02 04:00:25,Stop giving you refunds after a while,totally unfair and when i contacted uber eats support they sent me a very obvious cookie cutter email that did not even address my issue and then later on banned me from receiving refunds,3
544,2989,ubereats,1058959277,2022-11-12 02:31:59,: /,supposedly they allow you to order in advance for up to a week,1
544,2990,ubereats,1058959277,2022-11-12 02:31:59,: /,however without notice they canceled all of my upcoming orders and pretended that something was wrong with my debit card totally freaking me out,1
544,2991,ubereats,1058959277,2022-11-12 02:31:59,: /,however what had actually happened was they did not like it that i ordered the exact same meal for every day so they just decided to cancel them,1

544,2993,ubereats,1058959277,2022-11-12 02:31:59,: /,when in reality my debit card has now apparently been banned from ubereats all because they do not approve of me ordering the exact same meal every day,1
544,2994,ubereats,1058959277,2022-11-12 02:31:59,: /,i immediately went to doordash and was able to place an order no problem,1

544,2999,ubereats,1058959277,2022-11-12 02:31:59,: /,also since i could never get a fully straight answer the restaurant in question is called el castillo,1

545,3002,ubereats,1058959277,2022-11-24 04:57:35,Seriously?,my uber eats driver was 5 min from my house according to the app when it was cancelled,1
545,3003,ubereats,1058959277,2022-11-24 04:57:35,Seriously?,i even texted her prior to her arrival to give specific landmarks and description of the house with all the lights on,1
545,3004,ubereats,1058959277,2022-11-24 04:57:35,Seriously?,i was cancelled about 30 seconds later,1
545,3005,ubereats,1058959277,2022-11-24 04:57:35,Seriously?,i have never been so disappointed in uber eats,1
545,3006,ubereats,1058959277,2022-11-24 04:57:35,Seriously?,the rain was not a factor i was outside myself working and it was a light sprinkle,1
545,3007,ubereats,1058959277,2022-11-24 04:57:35,Seriously?,i expect a call an email anything to explain why my daughter had to wait an additional hour by ordering through doordash,1
545,3008,ubereats,1058959277,2022-11-24 04:57:35,Seriously?,i was partial to uber eats and just signed up for the monthly charge for whatever promo you all were offering,1
545,3009,ubereats,1058959277,2022-11-24 04:57:35,Seriously?,i feel quite sure i will be cancelling,1
545,3010,ubereats,1058959277,2022-11-24 04:57:35,Seriously?,that was ridiculous,1
545,3011,ubereats,1058959277,2022-11-24 04:57:35,Seriously?,we had already been waiting over 40 min and for her to decide she did not want to deliver seemed irrational,1
545,3012,ubereats,1058959277,2022-11-24 04:57:35,Seriously?,i am a surgical transplant nurse for a major hospital in ftw,1
545,3013,ubereats,1058959277,2022-11-24 04:57:35,Seriously?,next time one of our surgeons or vendors wants to treat us to lunch i will vote door dash,1
545,3014,ubereats,1058959277,2022-11-24 04:57:35,Seriously?,it is a shame bc prior to this uber eats would have been my vote,1
545,3015,ubereats,1058959277,2022-11-24 04:57:35,Seriously?,i expect to see my refund in the am considering it occurred prior to the holiday and i paid 60 for two entrees,1
546,3016,ubereats,1058959277,2022-10-10 03:13:44,Rude drivers,i do not usually order with them but we have very limited delivery options in our area and try various options doordash grubhub etc,1
546,3017,ubereats,1058959277,2022-10-10 03:13:44,Rude drivers,we had to have a reorder because it was not telling the drivers our house number so the first driver just left our order at a random house even though the box of food they were delivering had the full address with house number on it,1
546,3018,ubereats,1058959277,2022-10-10 03:13:44,Rude drivers,on the redelivery same issue happened but the delivery driver very rudely told me that i need to make sure i put my house address in so he is not wasting his gas trying to find the house since they barely pay enough to cover the gas,1
546,3019,ubereats,1058959277,2022-10-10 03:13:44,Rude drivers,when i explained that i had indeed put the house number in and he should talk to the company since clearly there is an issue on their end not giving the drivers the house number,1
546,3020,ubereats,1058959277,2022-10-10 03:13:44,Rude drivers,he told me i sound confused and must have put it in the wrong place and i should be grateful he even decided to deliver it to us as most people do not deliver to our area,1
546,3021,ubereats,1058959277,2022-10-10 03:13:44,Rude drivers,i think we will be deleting this app and sticking with the other companies from now on,1
547,3022,ubereats,1058959277,2022-09-20 22:06:47,Can't even order food.,on account creation a promotion was applied to my account until next month for free delivery,1
547,3023,ubereats,1058959277,2022-09-20 22:06:47,Can't even order food.,i should be applauding their customer care and service for that but instead it has completely ruined my experience with uber eats,1
547,3024,ubereats,1058959277,2022-09-20 22:06:47,Can't even order food.,whenever i press checkout i get an error message that says the promotion you applied could not be processed and cancels my checkout,1
547,3025,ubereats,1058959277,2022-09-20 22:06:47,Can't even order food.,since this promo was a part of the new account process i cannot take it off and thus cannot orderi have reached out twice to customer support about this and both times been told there is nothing they can do and that they are referring me to someone else over email,1
547,3026,ubereats,1058959277,2022-09-20 22:06:47,Can't even order food.,that email has never come,1
547,3027,ubereats,1058959277,2022-09-20 22:06:47,Can't even order food.,it boggles my mind this company is ok with only disrespecting their customers time and money,1
547,3028,ubereats,1058959277,2022-09-20 22:06:47,Can't even order food.,i even asked if i could just take the free delivery off and spend more money and that is also not possiblei waited and waited for an email that never came and ended up going to bed hungry,1
547,3029,ubereats,1058959277,2022-09-20 22:06:47,Can't even order food.,if that does not speak volumes for their values i do not know what else i could say to change your mindl,1
548,3030,ubereats,1058959277,2022-11-24 00:50:57,Worst App Ever,between ubereats and doordash ubereats has been the worst app,1
548,3031,ubereats,1058959277,2022-11-24 00:50:57,Worst App Ever,i am constantly missing items from my order every single time but this time was my last straw,1
548,3032,ubereats,1058959277,2022-11-24 00:50:57,Worst App Ever,i place an order and was waiting forever for it,1
548,3033,ubereats,1058959277,2022-11-24 00:50:57,Worst App Ever,i could have drove myself to the location and got the items myself but i wanted something convenient due to me not feeling too good and needing some items to help with my pain,1
548,3034,ubereats,1058959277,2022-11-24 00:50:57,Worst App Ever,i contact support the first time to ask them if it could be canceled and support tells me delivery is taking too long due to it being busy today and not a lot of drivers on the road,1
548,3035,ubereats,1058959277,2022-11-24 00:50:57,Worst App Ever,so when i contacted support a second time to cancel my order the person tells me to wait until the store closes and if no movement then they will refund me,1
548,3036,ubereats,1058959277,2022-11-24 00:50:57,Worst App Ever,refunds take 510 business days so not only did i spend money for no reason i have to get up and go to the store and spend extra money just to get what i need when i could have done this in the first place,1
548,3037,ubereats,1058959277,2022-11-24 00:50:57,Worst App Ever,after this experience i will be deleting this app and i will never use their services again,1
549,3038,ubereats,1058959277,2022-11-24 00:35:38,Deleted because the quality went to 0,i used to use uber eats often because it was obviously convenient and i currently do not have the luxury of leaving my apartment right now but i will gladly use anyone else,1
549,3039,ubereats,1058959277,2022-11-24 00:35:38,Deleted because the quality went to 0,it started with a mess up here and there but now every single order i have placed in the past 4 months has had either missing food canceled after an hour or delivered to a completely different place,1
549,3040,ubereats,1058959277,2022-11-24 00:35:38,Deleted because the quality went to 0,they used to atleast refund your money right away but now it will either take 10 business days or it can be credited it back to your account which only helps if you can afford to pay for you meal twice or sometimes 3 times initially and then be credited back your money,1
549,3041,ubereats,1058959277,2022-11-24 00:35:38,Deleted because the quality went to 0,i kid you not  i had to spend 80 for a single burrito because the drivers kept messing it up,1
549,3042,ubereats,1058959277,2022-11-24 00:35:38,Deleted because the quality went to 0,i would be more understanding if i had not used this as well as a driver and know how easy it is to double check yourself,1
549,3043,ubereats,1058959277,2022-11-24 00:35:38,Deleted because the quality went to 0,with all the different delivery apps nowadays  i would save yourself the money and frustration and use someone else with better standards,1
550,3044,ubereats,1058959277,2022-10-16 01:55:20,Tries to obscure the true cost from you in multiple ways,it is a fine service,3
550,3045,ubereats,1058959277,2022-10-16 01:55:20,Tries to obscure the true cost from you in multiple ways,it works,3
550,3046,ubereats,1058959277,2022-10-16 01:55:20,Tries to obscure the true cost from you in multiple ways,but what i hate about it is how it tries to obscure you from the true cost,3
550,3047,ubereats,1058959277,2022-10-16 01:55:20,Tries to obscure the true cost from you in multiple ways,first when you are adding items to a card it only shows you the cart total,3
550,3048,ubereats,1058959277,2022-10-16 01:55:20,Tries to obscure the true cost from you in multiple ways,then in the checkout it actually shows you the cost with fees,3
550,3049,ubereats,1058959277,2022-10-16 01:55:20,Tries to obscure the true cost from you in multiple ways,what is the point of showing me the cart total if that total has no bearing on what i  actually pay,3
550,3050,ubereats,1058959277,2022-10-16 01:55:20,Tries to obscure the true cost from you in multiple ways,then only after you finally completed the last step of the check out do they ask you for the tip,3
550,3051,ubereats,1058959277,2022-10-16 01:55:20,Tries to obscure the true cost from you in multiple ways,they base the tip on the entire order cost including all of their fees,3
550,3052,ubereats,1058959277,2022-10-16 01:55:20,Tries to obscure the true cost from you in multiple ways,and then when you select the tip at no point do they show you what the total is with both your order and the tipthey try hard to make sure you do not actually realize the true cost,3
550,3053,ubereats,1058959277,2022-10-16 01:55:20,Tries to obscure the true cost from you in multiple ways,of course this is what all apps in the industry,3
550,3054,ubereats,1058959277,2022-10-16 01:55:20,Tries to obscure the true cost from you in multiple ways,but i do find it very frustrating,3
550,3055,ubereats,1058959277,2022-10-16 01:55:20,Tries to obscure the true cost from you in multiple ways,i wish they would be more upfront about the true cost,3

551,3058,ubereats,1058959277,2022-11-01 05:06:42,Beware!  You will still be charged even if your order is not delivered,i was told that i have been be charged of 147 after the cancellation was completed,1
551,3059,ubereats,1058959277,2022-11-01 05:06:42,Beware!  You will still be charged even if your order is not delivered,i contacted their customer service right away and asked the representative to reinstate my order if the restaurant had already prepared my order,1
551,3060,ubereats,1058959277,2022-11-01 05:06:42,Beware!  You will still be charged even if your order is not delivered,however the customer service lady came back and told me that they are unable to reinstate my order nor issue me the refund,1

552,3066,ubereats,1058959277,2022-09-21 17:47:40,Awful service and delivery,i had the uber eats pass for quite some time and ordered regularly with minimal issues,1
552,3067,ubereats,1058959277,2022-09-21 17:47:40,Awful service and delivery,today my order which was medicine i could not go get was delivered to the wrong address the picture of the delivery showed it was not my house and i did not have the items on my porch,1
552,3068,ubereats,1058959277,2022-09-21 17:47:40,Awful service and delivery,i spoke with 2 customer service reps and they both argued with me and said it was delivered to the correct address,1
552,3069,ubereats,1058959277,2022-09-21 17:47:40,Awful service and delivery,it was not,1
552,3070,ubereats,1058959277,2022-09-21 17:47:40,Awful service and delivery,literally standing on my porch arguing with a rep who said it is there,1
552,3071,ubereats,1058959277,2022-09-21 17:47:40,Awful service and delivery,they were insistent on not refunding then ended the chat,1
552,3072,ubereats,1058959277,2022-09-21 17:47:40,Awful service and delivery,i am beyond frustrated,1
552,3073,ubereats,1058959277,2022-09-21 17:47:40,Awful service and delivery,i wound up calling and a refund issued minus the tip which is a joke since it is the drivers error,1
552,3075,ubereats,1058959277,2022-09-21 17:47:40,Awful service and delivery,never using this service again,1
552,3076,ubereats,1058959277,2022-09-21 17:47:40,Awful service and delivery,mistakes happen and i get that but do not argue with me telling me my order was there when it was not,1
552,3077,ubereats,1058959277,2022-09-21 17:47:40,Awful service and delivery,get better gps for your drivers or have the drivers actually answer your call when you call them as the driver declined my call,1
552,3078,ubereats,1058959277,2022-09-21 17:47:40,Awful service and delivery,this service is a joke for how expensive it is and how horribly you treat your valued customers,1
553,3079,ubereats,1058959277,2022-09-18 22:51:40,Difficult to use,i had never needed to use uber for any reason however my 3 year old is in the hospital diagnosised with cancer and so a friend gifted us an uber gift card to have food delivered tothe hospital,1
553,3080,ubereats,1058959277,2022-09-18 22:51:40,Difficult to use,it took three times for me to be able to use my gift card the first two times i tried to order breakfast at dunkin and then again tried to order lunch at bolay and it kept telling me to remove the promotion from the order,1
553,3081,ubereats,1058959277,2022-09-18 22:51:40,Difficult to use,the promotion it was talking about was because i just signed up and gave me free deliveries for a month,1
553,3082,ubereats,1058959277,2022-09-18 22:51:40,Difficult to use,there was no option to remove this anywherefinally the restaurant i chose to use this time had an option to have it delivered directly to me so i paid my delivery fee and  then it allowed me to use a gift card and place my order,1
553,3083,ubereats,1058959277,2022-09-18 22:51:40,Difficult to use,i honestly was so frustrated with this app and the whole situation not being able to remove the promotion uber gave me that i did not even add it to my order,1
553,3084,ubereats,1058959277,2022-09-18 22:51:40,Difficult to use,i promise i do not think i will ever use uber eats again besides the fact that i had the gift card today,1
554,3085,ubereats,1058959277,2022-12-04 09:07:07,Terrible Service from an Awful Company,some of the worst customer service i have ever experienced in my life and not just once on a repeated basis,1
554,3086,ubereats,1058959277,2022-12-04 09:07:07,Terrible Service from an Awful Company,they really do not care,1
554,3087,ubereats,1058959277,2022-12-04 09:07:07,Terrible Service from an Awful Company,any replies you get to requests for help are just boilerplate canned comments which usually do not have anything to do with the issue,1
554,3088,ubereats,1058959277,2022-12-04 09:07:07,Terrible Service from an Awful Company,they have devolved into the single worst company i can think of based on customer experience,1
554,3089,ubereats,1058959277,2022-12-04 09:07:07,Terrible Service from an Awful Company,they are genuinely horribletheir drivers never check order accuracy so it is often wrong has missing items etc,1
554,3090,ubereats,1058959277,2022-12-04 09:07:07,Terrible Service from an Awful Company,uber support tells me that due to my refund and adjustment history they cannot issue any type of refunds any more,1
554,3091,ubereats,1058959277,2022-12-04 09:07:07,Terrible Service from an Awful Company,a significant number of refunds or adjustments reflects poorly on uber eats and their quality of service not on my account history or trustworthiness,1
554,3092,ubereats,1058959277,2022-12-04 09:07:07,Terrible Service from an Awful Company,i submit images when i have an issue  there is literally photographic proof of what happened,1
554,3093,ubereats,1058959277,2022-12-04 09:07:07,Terrible Service from an Awful Company,my integrity is not in question and to insinuate that i am being dishonest is deeply offensiveperhaps uber should be more concerned with improving their order accuracy drivers and truly terrible customer service,1
554,3094,ubereats,1058959277,2022-12-04 09:07:07,Terrible Service from an Awful Company,it would be a better use of their time rather than blaming customers for their issueswhatever the competition is they cannot be worse than ubera final thought looking through these reviews i cannot help but be suspicious that there are so many reviews that show 5 stars but describe horribly negative experiences,1
554,3095,ubereats,1058959277,2022-12-04 09:07:07,Terrible Service from an Awful Company,given how untrustworthy this company is it is not a good look,1
555,3096,ubereats,1058959277,2022-11-22 02:32:19,Terrible Customer service,experienced total dissatisfaction with the whole app and services,1
555,3097,ubereats,1058959277,2022-11-22 02:32:19,Terrible Customer service,i did not appreciate the way in which their customer service rep implied dishonest behavior on my part,1
555,3098,ubereats,1058959277,2022-11-22 02:32:19,Terrible Customer service,there had been a 3 separate incidents back to back in which errors were made to my orders,1
555,3099,ubereats,1058959277,2022-11-22 02:32:19,Terrible Customer service,as expected i would reported those issues and the first 2 times they would issues a refund,1
555,3100,ubereats,1058959277,2022-11-22 02:32:19,Terrible Customer service,and although the refund is great it still did not make up for a total waste of time and a complete let down when the food i expected to received was not delivered as expected,1
555,3101,ubereats,1058959277,2022-11-22 02:32:19,Terrible Customer service,however on the last reported issue not only was i denied a refund but my issue was not taken seriously,1

555,3105,ubereats,1058959277,2022-11-22 02:32:19,Terrible Customer service,in addition they just said to rate the merchant directly so that those issues could be avoid in the future,1

556,3107,ubereats,1058959277,2022-10-31 00:23:49,Looking for the worst food delivery experience possible? Look no further!,an app and a company that actively lie to their customers pay their delivery people as poorly as everyone else  all while lining their grubby little silicon valley pockets and delivering little to no valuei have confirmed multiple times with both restaurants and delivery people that uber eats as mentioned in others reviews dispatches delivery people they actually choose whether or not to show up and often do not to the restaurant at their whim and with no relation to when diners food is actually readycurious then that the app will say the restaurant is wrapping up your order when nothing could be further from the truthlast night was the final straw as i placed my initial order circa 830p,1
556,3108,ubereats,1058959277,2022-10-31 00:23:49,Looking for the worst food delivery experience possible? Look no further!,uber eats then sent a delivery person to the restaurant who opted to stay there for approximately 10 seconds before the kitchen could get to food out to him he would left and canceled the order,1
556,3109,ubereats,1058959277,2022-10-31 00:23:49,Looking for the worst food delivery experience possible? Look no further!,no text notification or call just an email that showed up 15 minutes lateri was able to resubmit the order so fortunately my food was not tossed but 90 minutes later  after having spoken directly with the kitchen who confirmed my food had been ready since shortly after 830 and had been closed for the past 45 minutes  guess what uber eats was claiming as to the status of my foodyup,1
556,3110,ubereats,1058959277,2022-10-31 00:23:49,Looking for the worst food delivery experience possible? Look no further!,the closedforanhour kitchen was wrapping up my orderanything to say for yourselves uber eats,1

565,3219,ubereats,1058959277,2022-09-15 03:03:05,Terrible experience & customer service.,they will not respond for hours then when they do respond they simply offer a 5 uber eats cash credit,1
565,3220,ubereats,1058959277,2022-09-15 03:03:05,Terrible experience & customer service.,my last order for example the restaurant forgot 2 separate items and the 2 items i did receive  the first item was gross and soggy and the 2nd item was missing half of the item burger but did not have any sauce any toppings or any cheese,1
565,3221,ubereats,1058959277,2022-09-15 03:03:05,Terrible experience & customer service.,uber eats simply said heres a 5 uber eats credit even though that did not even cover the cost of the missing items much less the rest of the messed up and nasty order,1

568,3247,ubereats,1058959277,2022-10-24 21:30:12,Overpriced food that is always wrong - use another app,this is an overpriced and difficult experience and it is probably better to use a different delivery appupdate 1024 i am officially done with this app and it is clear that they treat everyone  customers drivers and restaurants  terribly while reaping huge profits,1
568,3248,ubereats,1058959277,2022-10-24 21:30:12,Overpriced food that is always wrong - use another app,recently i ordered from a restaurant the following items a side item that came with a side of sauce lo mein potstickers and a drink,1

569,3255,ubereats,1058959277,2022-12-01 01:54:49,Needs to work on driver acceptance rates/ out of radius,i placed an order for a fast food restaurant that is less than 10mins away,3
569,3256,ubereats,1058959277,2022-12-01 01:54:49,Needs to work on driver acceptance rates/ out of radius,the driver proceeded to accept the order drive past the restaurant and then drive 20 mins away from the area before heading back towards the restaurant to pick up the order,3
569,3257,ubereats,1058959277,2022-12-01 01:54:49,Needs to work on driver acceptance rates/ out of radius,i understand that there a surely a shortage of drivers but a driver should not be able to accept an order and then drive x amount of miles away from the restaurant and delivery area,3
569,3258,ubereats,1058959277,2022-12-01 01:54:49,Needs to work on driver acceptance rates/ out of radius,the order should be able to be accepted by someone else if a driver proceeds out of a certain radius if they have not actually picked up the order from the restaurant yet,3
570,3259,ubereats,1058959277,2022-11-22 16:18:21,Shockingly bad,both the app and the service are terrible in my experience,1
570,3260,ubereats,1058959277,2022-11-22 16:18:21,Shockingly bad,i just gave them another try after a bad experience a while back and it was a total fail,1
570,3261,ubereats,1058959277,2022-11-22 16:18:21,Shockingly bad,i did not receive a notification from the app when the driver tried to contact me even though notifications were enabled got a robocall instead yet when i called the driver via the app they simply would not answer,1
570,3262,ubereats,1058959277,2022-11-22 16:18:21,Shockingly bad,the app told me i could leave a message yet repeated calls just disconnected me,1
570,3263,ubereats,1058959277,2022-11-22 16:18:21,Shockingly bad,my internetphone signal was strong so it was not that,1
570,3264,ubereats,1058959277,2022-11-22 16:18:21,Shockingly bad,my order status switched to delivered yet the food was never delivered,1
570,3265,ubereats,1058959277,2022-11-22 16:18:21,Shockingly bad,the driver simply would not answer their phone and the app gave me no way to actually contact a human being,1
570,3266,ubereats,1058959277,2022-11-22 16:18:21,Shockingly bad,it offered to refund what i paid but my dad and i were left without dinner and the promo credit i used was not given back,1
570,3267,ubereats,1058959277,2022-11-22 16:18:21,Shockingly bad,by this point the restaurants near me were closed and it pretty much messed up our evening,1
570,3268,ubereats,1058959277,2022-11-22 16:18:21,Shockingly bad,never again,1
571,3269,ubereats,1058959277,2022-10-12 17:57:38,bad attention and they steal your money 😡,they are thieves they stole my money whenever i asked for my orders they took time to assign the delivery person and i had to cancel my last order because it took a long time to assign my delivery person i had to wait for the hours for my order to arrive and the restaurant was at only 7 minutes from my house i despaired of waiting for him to assign me to the person who would deliver my order and i decided to cancel it,1
571,3270,ubereats,1058959277,2022-10-12 17:57:38,bad attention and they steal your money 😡,i went to the restaurant myself to buy a lot of food and asked about that order and he told me,1
571,3271,ubereats,1058959277,2022-10-12 17:57:38,bad attention and they steal your money 😡,that if it had been canceled by uber or that they had not charged anything because uver canceled it and they never returned my money to my account they stole 56 dollars from me and they have not returned it to me apart from giving bad attention in assigning the relauncher without madrones because if a client does not receive any food and the restaurant does not charge anything you keep the money,1
572,3272,ubereats,1058959277,2022-10-16 17:18:50,Poor customer service,do not ever click the cancel order icon for any reason because you will be charged the full amount for your order,1
572,3273,ubereats,1058959277,2022-10-16 17:18:50,Poor customer service,for example i placed an order with a merchant and realized i had a wrong item so i canceled the order within seconds after placing it,1
572,3274,ubereats,1058959277,2022-10-16 17:18:50,Poor customer service,i then proceeded to place another order with the same merchant,1
572,3275,ubereats,1058959277,2022-10-16 17:18:50,Poor customer service,uber charged me for both orders even though i received only one,1
572,3276,ubereats,1058959277,2022-10-16 17:18:50,Poor customer service,i understand if there is a cancel fee but it should equate to the full amount of the order,1
572,3277,ubereats,1058959277,2022-10-16 17:18:50,Poor customer service,this is an extremely poor policy,1
572,3278,ubereats,1058959277,2022-10-16 17:18:50,Poor customer service,if uber is still going to charge for the full amount the cancel icon should not even be an option,1
572,3279,ubereats,1058959277,2022-10-16 17:18:50,Poor customer service,i do not understand why this is,1
572,3280,ubereats,1058959277,2022-10-16 17:18:50,Poor customer service,it would be logical to deliver the customers canceled order if the customer will charged for that order either way,1
572,3281,ubereats,1058959277,2022-10-16 17:18:50,Poor customer service,uber has lost a customer moving forward as i will not continue to provide them business when they take advantage of customers,1
573,3282,ubereats,1058959277,2022-12-13 20:26:19,Something is wrong with this app,at first my boyfriend and i thought it was a glitch,2
573,3283,ubereats,1058959277,2022-12-13 20:26:19,Something is wrong with this app,however this is the 3rd time someone has supposedly picked up our order and then dropped it,2
573,3284,ubereats,1058959277,2022-12-13 20:26:19,Something is wrong with this app,so a delivery that should have taken 30 minutes has now taken over an hour because uber has to keep finding other drivers to get our order at times we have even experienced a situation where after 2030 minutes no one has even attempted to pick up our order leaving us wondering if we are being lowballed by this company  i do not understand what is happening on this app,2
573,3285,ubereats,1058959277,2022-12-13 20:26:19,Something is wrong with this app,sometimes by the time we get our food it is basically cold and we have to reheat it,2
573,3286,ubereats,1058959277,2022-12-13 20:26:19,Something is wrong with this app,it is almost like we should have just gone to get the food ourselves by this point,2
573,3287,ubereats,1058959277,2022-12-13 20:26:19,Something is wrong with this app,our experiences with uber eats have taken the convenience out of it for us and we will no long use this provider,2
574,3288,ubereats,1058959277,2022-11-19 13:26:05,"Some drivers aren't great, agents are even worse",i submitted a complaint after my beverage the entire order was spilled,4
574,3289,ubereats,1058959277,2022-11-19 13:26:05,"Some drivers aren't great, agents are even worse",i submitted a photo and all i got told was that since i did not send in a photo with my complaint i will not get a refund for the driver spilling my drink,4
574,3290,ubereats,1058959277,2022-11-19 13:26:05,"Some drivers aren't great, agents are even worse",i told them i had and i was confused by what they needed and they closed the conversation,4
574,3291,ubereats,1058959277,2022-11-19 13:26:05,"Some drivers aren't great, agents are even worse",here is the kickeri heard the driver filing a complaint with uber after she spilled ofer half of the drink on her seatsall uber is concerned is cutting their losses,4
574,3292,ubereats,1058959277,2022-11-19 13:26:05,"Some drivers aren't great, agents are even worse",out of the three orders to the same place i made that day only two of them made it to my door and only one was not spilled,4
574,3293,ubereats,1058959277,2022-11-19 13:26:05,"Some drivers aren't great, agents are even worse",i think uber needs to take a look ate their policies and i think they need to be more honest about just not wanting to give a refund,4
575,3294,ubereats,1058959277,2022-11-30 22:29:05,Charged for an order that never arrived and charged again when the second order was cancelled.,i ordered food to be delivered to my girlfriend who is in a pinch and does not have money for lunch,1
575,3295,ubereats,1058959277,2022-11-30 22:29:05,Charged for an order that never arrived and charged again when the second order was cancelled.,not only did the driver not follow the instructions but after calling and having me reiterate them to him he never delivered food to my girlfriend,1
575,3296,ubereats,1058959277,2022-11-30 22:29:05,Charged for an order that never arrived and charged again when the second order was cancelled.,after that i attempted another order but my girlfriend had to go back to work so she could not eat even if she wanted to and we were charged a second time for cancelling,1

575,3298,ubereats,1058959277,2022-11-30 22:29:05,Charged for an order that never arrived and charged again when the second order was cancelled.,instead they offer uber cash which traps you into spending more with them and they refused to refund the 2nd order that was unable to be completed as wellcompletely dissatisfied and now i am out 5060 dollars,1
575,3299,ubereats,1058959277,2022-11-30 22:29:05,Charged for an order that never arrived and charged again when the second order was cancelled.,i do not care about the uber cash remaining in my account,1

576,3302,ubereats,1058959277,2022-10-15 06:51:05,Bogus customer servo,overall the restaurants and delivery is decent,3
576,3303,ubereats,1058959277,2022-10-15 06:51:05,Bogus customer servo,but the customer serviceassistance is just horrible,3
576,3304,ubereats,1058959277,2022-10-15 06:51:05,Bogus customer servo,although online it is said you you will only be charged an order after cancelling if a driver has already been assigned to your order,3
576,3305,ubereats,1058959277,2022-10-15 06:51:05,Bogus customer servo,however i had cancelled my order because i had forgotten a few items i wanted to add not even 5 mins after i had placed it and no driver had been assigned either so i did not think it would be a problem,3
576,3306,ubereats,1058959277,2022-10-15 06:51:05,Bogus customer servo,i ended up being charged anyway for the order and delivery which was about 30 and their solution was for me to place another order as in wasting 60 in total when i did not receive anything at all from the first order,3

577,3311,ubereats,1058959277,2022-09-11 15:16:04,"If I could give 0 stars, I would",instructions and what not are never followed if something is missing they just do not care and uber eats is not going to do anything to help,1

581,3344,ubereats,1058959277,2022-12-08 19:42:33,Custom service is awful,it is frustrating to pay for food that i cannot even eat and then have them not even try to correct the issue,1
581,3345,ubereats,1058959277,2022-12-08 19:42:33,Custom service is awful,definitely canceled my uberone and will be deleting the app,1

582,3347,ubereats,1058959277,2022-09-19 04:20:10,Freezing and app closing,i do not know what it is but every time i make it to the end where i submit order the screen goes black and has the white circle like phone is thinking then i have to re open or restart the app,3
582,3348,ubereats,1058959277,2022-09-19 04:20:10,Freezing and app closing,on top of that the app does not allow me to respond to the driver within the chat it freezes and acts like i am not writing this is a serious annoyance and inconvenience  uber has zero answers for me about it,3
582,3349,ubereats,1058959277,2022-09-19 04:20:10,Freezing and app closing,other than that the app itself outside of function is what it is,3
582,3350,ubereats,1058959277,2022-09-19 04:20:10,Freezing and app closing,using uber eats for daily delivery needs can be great but it also can be bad depending where you are located if the restaurant partners in area do not have good service or common sense  drivers included,3
583,3351,ubereats,1058959277,2022-12-05 00:31:25,Nonexistent customer service.

585,3369,ubereats,1058959277,2022-10-30 15:06:24,Service not so good,horrible service and they do not notify you when they drop your food off so how do you know it is the right location anyways that is not how you do service it is like you have to constantly watch your food being delivered and you better not be busy because they will drop and just leave with no point of contact they will refund you but your tip is gone,1

586,3377,ubereats,1058959277,2022-11-21 02:51:42,Arrives at Max Time with Cold Food,if the app is set up to tip just like the uber drivers taking passengers maybe uber would realize a change should be made to their process,3

619,3635,ubereats,1058959277,2022-10-17 00:55:02,"Really bad service, no way to remove tip, cold pizza and no refund",delivery guy chose to pick up an extra delivery even though the delivery was listed as delayed did not show up for another 20 minutes and the pizza was coldon hold the entire time to reconnect to an agentfirst thing from the new agent sorry for the wait our system keeps rebootingso he knows it is kicking people outdespite that he then says the pizza arrived when it was supposed to,1

620,3640,ubereats,1058959277,2022-10-05 21:26:03,Tipping Issue,uber eats has a ridiculous policy where you must tip before you receive your food,1
620,3641,ubereats,1058959277,2022-10-05 21:26:03,Tipping Issue,they no longer give you the option to change the tip after you receive the food,1
620,3642,ubereats,1058959277,2022-10-05 21:26:03,Tipping Issue,the only purpose of tipping is to reward good service,1
620,3643,ubereats,1058959277,2022-10-05 21:26:03,Tipping Issue,but if the service is bad you cannot change the tip,1
620,3644,ubereats,1058959277,2022-10-05 21:26:03,Tipping Issue,this is absurd,1
620,3645,ubereats,1058959277,2022-10-05 21:26:03,Tipping Issue,if you do not tip when you place the order it is likely that no uber eats driver will pick it up,1
620,3646,ubereats,1058959277,2022-10-05 21:26:03,Tipping Issue,this is because they are able to choose jobs based off of the tip amount,1
620,3647,ubereats,1058959277,2022-10-05 21:26:03,Tipping Issue,this results in an obscene amount of wasted food being thrown out because it was not delivered,1
620,3648,ubereats,1058959277,2022-10-05 21:26:03,Tipping Issue,this also hurts uber because customers demand cash back,1
620,3649,ubereats,1058959277,2022-10-05 21:26:03,Tipping Issue,i have no clue why uber eats would implement this policy,1
620,3650,ubereats,1058959277,2022-10-05 21:26:03,Tipping Issue,tips are meant to reward good service,1
620,3651,ubereats,1058959277,2022-10-05 21:26:03,Tipping Issue,you cannot anticipate whether your service will be good or not,1
620,3652,ubereats,1058959277,2022-10-05 21:26:03,Tipping Issue,please revert this uber,1
620,3653,ubereats,1058959277,2022-10-05 21:26:03,Tipping Issue,allow editing tips again,1
621,3654,ubereats,1058959277,2022-09-17 21:01:23,Never using this app again.,it is so funny how my review got deleted,1
621,3655,ubereats,1058959277,2022-09-17 21:01:23,Never using this app again.,uber eats was not accepting none of my payment methods so i bought a gift card to try to use to pay for the food now it is not even allowing me to use that,1
621,3656,ubereats,1058959277,2022-09-17 21:01:23,Never using this app again.,i contacted uber and all uber could do for me was transfer me to a specialized team which they have no idea how long it can take to even get the problem situated,1
621,3657,ubereats,1058959277,2022-09-17 21:01:23,Never using this app again.,they would not even offer me a refund for a gift card that i cannot use,1

621,3659,ubereats,1058959277,2022-09-17 21:01:23,Never using this app again.,that is alright though i will call every single day until my situation is resolved,1
621,3660,ubereats,1058959277,2022-09-17 21:01:23,Never using this app again.,so great of a company to offer this kind of solution and steal 25 dollars from me rather then offering me my refund due to the fact that i cannot even use the gift card,1
621,3661,ubereats,1058959277,2022-09-17 21:01:23,Never using this app again.,you do not know the first thing about good customer service and that is real sad,1
622,3662,ubereats,1058959277,2022-12-17 21:19:26,you should require a $2 minimum tip per order,my boyfriend is a driver and he just completed 3 deliveries but only made 8 total so far,3
622,3663,ubereats,1058959277,2022-12-17 21:19:26,you should require a $2 minimum tip per order,people do not seem to be tipping and with all the other fees uber takes out of the drivers pay it is becoming unrealistic to be a driver anymore,3
622,3664,ubereats,1058959277,2022-12-17 21:19:26,you should require a $2 minimum tip per order,gas for those 3 deliveries would cost more than what he made so really he is taking a financial loss just to work for this company,3
622,3665,ubereats,1058959277,2022-12-17 21:19:26,you should require a $2 minimum tip per order,if you do not want to require a tip from customers maybe consider giving up a small percentage of fees you take and using that money to increase the minimum pay per delivery for drivers,3
622,3666,ubereats,1058959277,2022-12-17 21:19:26,you should require a $2 minimum tip per order,it would also be nice if you did more of those events where you earn 5 extra for every 3 deliveries etc,3
623,3667,ubereats,1058959277,2022-12-06 16:24:32,"Do not use, you will regret.",not only is the app buggy and annoying to userandomly closing while i am making an order or bugging out when i am trying to contact my driver,1
623,3668,ubereats,1058959277,2022-12-06 16:24:32,"Do not use, you will regret.",the support is non existent,1
623,3669,ubereats,1058959277,2022-12-06 16:24:32,"Do not use, you will regret.",my orders have been messed up multiple times but when you contact support you could be waiting up to 34 days for a response,1
623,3670,ubereats,1058959277,2022-12-06 16:24:32,"Do not use, you will regret.",then when you get the response they ask for information that you would have had 3 days ago which was not asked for at the time of the original claim but now you do not so they throw you 5 dollars in uber cash and say f off for a 45 dollar order that was ruined or wrong,1
623,3671,ubereats,1058959277,2022-12-06 16:24:32,"Do not use, you will regret.",i was an uber one member as well which you think would make things better,1
623,3672,ubereats,1058959277,2022-12-06 16:24:32,"Do not use, you will regret.",will never use the app again same with uber,1
623,3673,ubereats,1058959277,2022-12-06 16:24:32,"Do not use, you will regret.",it is a scam and they do not care what happens to your money or food as long as they get paid,1

634,3760,ubereats,1058959277,2022-10-28 01:39:58,Skip,this does not even include tip because they do not give their drivers a bonus or tip,1
634,3761,ubereats,1058959277,2022-10-28 01:39:58,Skip,so on top of our triple price we have to top the drivers,1
634,3762,ubereats,1058959277,2022-10-28 01:39:58,Skip,then i tried to delete the app and of course they made it nearly impossible to delete my account,1
634,3763,ubereats,1058959277,2022-10-28 01:39:58,Skip,i had to do extensive research on google and if you are wondering you have to click on privacy the delete button used to be on that page but of course they deleted it and now once there you have to click on help or something then it takes you to the actual website where you have to scroll down and find the delete button and go through a 30 day waiting trial period before you account actually gets deleted,1

638,3795,ubereats,1058959277,2022-10-21 21:27:12,Horrible Service,so we had to not only pay for our wings at wing house so the money was charged twice until the refund eventually went through but we had to drive to wing house ourselves to get the food so we could actually have our dinner,1

655,3949,ubereats,1058959277,2022-10-01 23:41:16,Waste of Time,my experience with this app in the chesapeake va area is that many restaurants simply do not partner with uber eats,1
655,3950,ubereats,1058959277,2022-10-01 23:41:16,Waste of Time,the restaurants that do end up charging a hefty delivery fee or cancel orders,1
655,3951,ubereats,1058959277,2022-10-01 23:41:16,Waste of Time,this has led to at times everyone picking a restaurant each person going through the menu placing the order having it cancelled or getting a pop up halfway through the order that the restaurant is no longer available just to have to go through the whole process again,1
655,3952,ubereats,1058959277,2022-10-01 23:41:16,Waste of Time,generally you do not pick a delivery option for dinner until your already close to dinner time,1
655,3953,ubereats,1058959277,2022-10-01 23:41:16,Waste of Time,it is not just a waste of time it is exceptionally frustrating and puts a hungry family in the position of scrambling to then come up with a dinner option that will actually be available,1

659,3990,ubereats,1058959277,2022-09-25 01:35:39,Estimates are off by hours,they need to do better about getting estimates from other customers and actually factoring that in,1
660,3991,ubereats,1058959277,2022-09-20 03:12:13,"Great App, WORST SERVICE",discrimination to the highest level,1

660,3993,ubereats,1058959277,2022-09-20 03:12:13,"Great App, WORST SERVICE",and wanted to check if they have upgraded their services but gone downhill,1
660,3994,ubereats,1058959277,2022-09-20 03:12:13,"Great App, WORST SERVICE",just a day ago before writing this review ordered through eats and the delivery persons car broke down right infront of the restaurant,1
660,3995,ubereats,1058959277,2022-09-20 03:12:13,"Great App, WORST SERVICE",though the delivery person contacted the support they took staggering 30 mins to call me and update that my order will not be delivered,1
660,3996,ubereats,1058959277,2022-09-20 03:12:13,"Great App, WORST SERVICE",when asked on the call to connect to a supervisor they apparently do not have a way to do so,1
660,3997,ubereats,1058959277,2022-09-20 03:12:13,"Great App, WORST SERVICE",also when i asked them to place another order on the call they could not do that either,1
660,3998,ubereats,1058959277,2022-09-20 03:12:13,"Great App, WORST SERVICE",i wanted to raise issues but for that i had to drop off the call from the support team and call them back what a joke,1
661,4000,ubereats,1058959277,2022-10-30 06:27:58,No accountability,uber eats this is the last dollar you take from me,1

661,4003,ubereats,1058959277,2022-10-30 06:27:58,No accountability,so inconsistent,1
661,4004,ubereats,1058959277,2022-10-30 06:27:58,No accountability,my orders are constantly delayed,1
661,4005,ubereats,1058959277,2022-10-30 06:27:58,No accountability,it will give you the approx delivery time and then it gets delayed 30 mins or longer,1
661,4006,ubereats,1058959277,2022-10-30 06:27:58,No accountability,fees are out of control,1
661,4007,ubereats,1058959277,2022-10-30 06:27:58,No accountability,always missing items or getting them wrong and they never refund or credit you for the mistakes,1
661,4008,ubereats,1058959277,2022-10-30 06:27:58,No accountability,over it,1
661,4009,ubereats,1058959277,2022-10-30 06:27:58,No accountability,this app was my preferred app even though it is pricier than others but i have had it,1
661,4010,ubereats,1058959277,2022-10-30 06:27:58,No accountability,i ordered nachos and they should of been here by now but instead it got delayed over 30 mins,1
661,4011,ubereats,1058959277,2022-10-30 06:27:58,No accountability,i am sure these soggy nachos will full fill my hunger,1
661,4012,ubereats,1058959277,2022-10-30 06:27:58,No accountability,should of just gone to pick them up,1
661,4013,ubereats,1058959277,2022-10-30 06:27:58,No accountability,i have a twisted ankle so this is why i am relying on this app so heavily lately but dealing with uber eats is much more painful,1
662,4014,ubereats,1058959277,2022-10-25 23:01:55,Great app,i think that it is a great app but one thing that i think they could add that would make my experience a lot better in this app is if they have a way to tell the restaurant that your ordering from like a custom note or a message because sometimes there is not a certain customization optionfor example if i want less ice in my drink because a restaurant puts way too much ice and that is not an option in the customization menu then i should be able to write a note that says less ice,4
662,4015,ubereats,1058959277,2022-10-25 23:01:55,Great app,they could already have that feature but idk where it is,4
663,4016,ubereats,1058959277,2022-09-27 19:09:47,App works fine but notifications are insane,never really had an issue with the uberuber eats app itself but my main issue is the number of push notifications they send through,3
663,4017,ubereats,1058959277,2022-09-27 19:09:47,App works fine but notifications are insane,i have never once seen an ad for some promo and found it important or worthwhile but i have considered fully deleting the app after getting 510 push notifications like that in a day,3
663,4018,ubereats,1058959277,2022-09-27 19:09:47,App works fine but notifications are insane,you have to hunt to find the settings to turn them off and they always somehow mysteriously turn back on after a month or two,3
663,4019,ubereats,1058959277,2022-09-27 19:09:47,App works fine but notifications are insane,please consider being more thoughtful in your push notifications to customers and stop bombarding with nonsense,3
664,4020,ubereats,1058959277,2022-11-07 23:09:48,Charged $85 dollars for cancellation,uber eats charged me 85 for cancelation,5
664,4021,ubereats,1058959277,2022-11-07 23:09:48,Charged $85 dollars for cancellation,i placed an order and cancelled it 20 seconds later because i wanted to change my method  of payment,5
664,4022,ubereats,1058959277,2022-11-07 23:09:48,Charged $85 dollars for cancellation,i cancelled it and placed the order again  with the method of payment i wanted to use,5
664,4023,ubereats,1058959277,2022-11-07 23:09:48,Charged $85 dollars for cancellation,they delivered the order and everything seemed to be okay but one day later i cheked my bank account and realized they charged me 85 for cancellation,5
664,4024,ubereats,1058959277,2022-11-07 23:09:48,Charged $85 dollars for cancellation,i call them and they said i should have read all uber eats  policiesyou know the small tricky letters so be carful while using this service,5
665,4025,ubereats,1058959277,2022-12-17 18:07:35,Limited refunds,i like the app but when it comes to missing items beware of the times it happens,1
665,4026,ubereats,1058959277,2022-12-17 18:07:35,Limited refunds,they can only reimburse you a few times,1
665,4027,ubereats,1058959277,2022-12-17 18:07:35,Limited refunds,after that you will be paying full price without any type of credit or reimbursement for missing items,1
665,4028,ubereats,1058959277,2022-12-17 18:07:35,Limited refunds,which i think is completely unfair because that is your money,1
665,4029,ubereats,1058959277,2022-12-17 18:07:35,Limited refunds,unfortunately i have had the bad luck of always missing an item in my order and there is nothing i can do about it,1
665,4030,ubereats,1058959277,2022-12-17 18:07:35,Limited refunds,i think the person in charge of picking up your order should verify everything is there to avoid missing items,1
665,4031,ubereats,1058959277,2022-12-17 18:07:35,Limited refunds,especially when the item is obvious,1
665,4032,ubereats,1058959277,2022-12-17 18:07:35,Limited refunds,for example the drink,1
665,4033,ubereats,1058959277,2022-12-17 18:07:35,Limited refunds,additionally some drivers have poor communication skills and they make unexpected stops without warning,1
666,4034,ubereats,1058959277,2022-11-21 16:03:41,Terrible customer service,i have been a very loyal uber eats customer for the past few years,1
666,4035,ubereats,1058959277,2022-11-21 16:03:41,Terrible customer service,a couple nights ago i ordered food and one of the items had a very long hair in it,1
666,4036,ubereats,1058959277,2022-11-21 16:03:41,Terrible customer service,absolutely disgusting,1
666,4037,ubereats,1058959277,2022-11-21 16:03:41,Terrible customer service,i wound up throwing away the whole order because of how unsanitary that is,1
666,4038,ubereats,1058959277,2022-11-21 16:03:41,Terrible customer service,i contacted uber eats customer service and they refunded me for the one item that had the hair in it 7 of a 40 order,1
666,4039,ubereats,1058959277,2022-11-21 16:03:41,Terrible customer service,i have messaged them 5 times requesting the full refund since i had to throw the food out and they tell me it is their policy to work with the restaurants to resolve food safety issues and will not refund the rest of the order,1
666,4040,ubereats,1058959277,2022-11-21 16:03:41,Terrible customer service,i am done with uber eats after such terrible service,1
666,4041,ubereats,1058959277,2022-11-21 16:03:41,Terrible customer service,i paid for food that was thrown away,1
666,4042,ubereats,1058959277,2022-11-21 16:03:41,Terrible customer service,a full refund should have happened immediately,1
667,4043,ubereats,1058959277,2022-10-19 14:51:01,No customer service,i typically use dash pass but wanted to try uber one out,2
667,4044,ubereats,1058959277,2022-10-19 14:51:01,No customer service,this is not about the restaurants because i have learned they are all trashy at making food and getting orders correct,2
667,4045,ubereats,1058959277,2022-10-19 14:51:01,No customer service,but when there is a problem uber cannot help there is no person to talk to,2
667,4046,ubereats,1058959277,2022-10-19 14:51:01,No customer service,dash pass takes 10 seconds to fix or refund me,2
667,4047,ubereats,1058959277,2022-10-19 14:51:01,No customer service,uber takes 10 years to find the help button and still does not fix anything,2
667,4048,ubereats,1058959277,2022-10-19 14:51:01,No customer service,you are left waiting for an email that never arrives,2
667,4049,ubereats,1058959277,2022-10-19 14:51:01,No customer service,going back to dash pass they also do not allow you to change the tip which i fear for the uber drivers getting ripped off when it is not there fault the order is wrong,2
667,4050,ubereats,1058959277,2022-10-19 14:51:01,No customer service,i still give good tips because gas is expensive,2
668,4052,ubereats,1058959277,2022-12-04 01:37:35,Flat soda because of marketing scheme,i have been using uber eats for a few years now but lately my orders have been arriving late,1
668,4053,ubereats,1058959277,2022-12-04 01:37:35,Flat soda because of marketing scheme,today i ordered food that was more than 20 minutes late,1
668,4054,ubereats,1058959277,2022-12-04 01:37:35,Flat soda because of marketing scheme,my food was cold and my soda was flat,1
668,4055,ubereats,1058959277,2022-12-04 01:37:35,Flat soda because of marketing scheme,in the past uber eats has offered a discount on my next order,1
668,4056,ubereats,1058959277,2022-12-04 01:37:35,Flat soda because of marketing scheme,but lately i have been receiving emails instead to sign up for uber one or something,1
668,4057,ubereats,1058959277,2022-12-04 01:37:35,Flat soda because of marketing scheme,trying to get me to have a free trial as an apology,1
668,4058,ubereats,1058959277,2022-12-04 01:37:35,Flat soda because of marketing scheme,it is just a marketing scheme,1
668,4059,ubereats,1058959277,2022-12-04 01:37:35,Flat soda because of marketing scheme,i think they are directing the drivers to purposefully delay the food to either get people to pay the priority fee or get people to sign up for this uber one thing,1
668,4060,ubereats,1058959277,2022-12-04 01:37:35,Flat soda because of marketing scheme,it is disingenuous and shady and i deleted the app because of it,1
668,4061,ubereats,1058959277,2022-12-04 01:37:35,Flat soda because of marketing scheme,i will not be using it any more and will happily give my business to other food delivery apps,1
669,4062,ubereats,1058959277,2022-09-22 01:21:36,Disappointed,i wish i was not writing this negative review but it is gotten to the point where i need to say something,1
669,4063,ubereats,1058959277,2022-09-22 01:21:36,Disappointed,i used this app all the time when i was very sick about a year ago and basically relied on it to get food,1
669,4064,ubereats,1058959277,2022-09-22 01:21:36,Disappointed,everything worked great that is until i stopped paying for uber one for financial reasons,1
669,4065,ubereats,1058959277,2022-09-22 01:21:36,Disappointed,so far since the day of cancellation every single order without fail has been wrong or something has been wrong with the app,1
669,4066,ubereats,1058959277,2022-09-22 01:21:36,Disappointed,i am not talking about just a few orders too i am talking about dozens over the past 6 months with little to no help with returns,1
669,4067,ubereats,1058959277,2022-09-22 01:21:36,Disappointed,the same thing has also been happening to my boyfriend so i know it is not just me,1
669,4068,ubereats,1058959277,2022-09-22 01:21:36,Disappointed,this used to be my goto app for ordering food but now i am heavily considering switching to doordash,1
670,4069,ubereats,1058959277,2022-11-04 22:10:46,Competing w DoorDash and doing it wrong?,they are competing with doordashs ability to add to your order with a 0 delivery fee but the weird thing is that dd has your deliverer pickup both orders,2
670,4070,ubereats,1058959277,2022-11-04 22:10:46,Competing w DoorDash and doing it wrong?,uber eats hires a totally other person so you are left waiting for the second part to your order and probably not paying the other guy as much since you tip differently when its combined vs two individual orders assuming its the same person,2
670,4071,ubereats,1058959277,2022-11-04 22:10:46,Competing w DoorDash and doing it wrong?,like on dd i would add to my already placed tip as a bonus,2

682,4172,ubereats,1058959277,2022-10-04 18:33:37,Convenient but not much else,i use uber eats primarily when working conferences or other allday events when going to pick up food myself is not an optionthe good news is that it is convenient and offers lots of options,3
682,4173,ubereats,1058959277,2022-10-04 18:33:37,Convenient but not much else,there are several things that make me want to delete the app however,3
682,4174,ubereats,1058959277,2022-10-04 18:33:37,Convenient but not much else,the biggest issue is freshness drivers almost always pick food up late so it is been sitting at the restaurant for 20 minutes before it even gets out the door,3
682,4175,ubereats,1058959277,2022-10-04 18:33:37,Convenient but not much else,i tip well so i cannot understand why this happens consistentlyit also drives me crazy that you cannot search or sort by distance,3
682,4176,ubereats,1058959277,2022-10-04 18:33:37,Convenient but not much else,i do not want food from a restaurant that is 9 miles away,3
682,4177,ubereats,1058959277,2022-10-04 18:33:37,Convenient but not much else,it will be gross by the time it arrives,3
682,4178,ubereats,1058959277,2022-10-04 18:33:37,Convenient but not much else,i have to use google maps to see nearby restaurants then see if they are on uber eatsdrivers forget to bring beverages probably 75 of the time,3
682,4179,ubereats,1058959277,2022-10-04 18:33:37,Convenient but not much else,and they bring napkins and utensils about 10 of the time,3
682,4180,ubereats,1058959277,2022-10-04 18:33:37,Convenient but not much else,really the only reason i do not delete the app is that grubhub is somehow worse,3
683,4181,ubereats,1058959277,2022-10-27 23:33:09,Good service,compared to door dash it is like getting a five star restaurant to a a 2 even if you order to the same restaurant,5
683,4182,ubereats,1058959277,2022-10-27 23:33:09,Good service,other companies forget your sauces half your order and provide a credit without even talking to you i do not want sweet and sour chicken without the swerve n sour and a credit for 200 off the 10 sweet n sour chicken does not make it rightthen you can go to the chat room wait 30 minutes to get literally cussed out by the overworked twenty something unprofessionally handling the situation,5
684,4183,ubereats,1058959277,2022-11-23 19:41:35,"App is good, service is not!",my coworkers and i have ordered twice with uber eats once in july and once in novembertoday,2
684,4184,ubereats,1058959277,2022-11-23 19:41:35,"App is good, service is not!",both times we paid for priority delivery and the orders have shown up well past the window,2
684,4185,ubereats,1058959277,2022-11-23 19:41:35,"App is good, service is not!",it took over 2 hours for the first ordered and for the one today the restaurant had not even finished preparing the other when the priority time expired,2
684,4186,ubereats,1058959277,2022-11-23 19:41:35,"App is good, service is not!",so we either need to work with our restaurants to make sure they are following your estimates you update your estimates so we know if you are actually going to make it her on time make it more of a deadline or you just quit taking everyones money for priority delivery because it especially seems like a scam,2
685,4187,ubereats,1058959277,2022-11-16 07:05:15,Trash app,this is the worst design for a food service app  im constantly having my orders delayed to the point where i can no longer get the meal i order over an hour ago,1
685,4188,ubereats,1058959277,2022-11-16 07:05:15,Trash app,i was hungry back when i ordered so you can bet after waiting an hour and 40 minutes im much hungrier than before,1
685,4189,ubereats,1058959277,2022-11-16 07:05:15,Trash app,now for regular orders that are just late but still fulfilled you expect me to enjoy,1
685,4190,ubereats,1058959277,2022-11-16 07:05:15,Trash app,i had to wait forever for coldsoggy food,1
685,4191,ubereats,1058959277,2022-11-16 07:05:15,Trash app,why is the restaurant preparing this food immediately after accepting the order they should not be making the food until a driver has confirmed they will deliver it that food sits out for over an hour before it gets to me that is barely safehealthy depending on what it is rework this entire app get a new strategy,1
686,4192,ubereats,1058959277,2022-09-26 18:21:52,Didn't get a refund for cancellation,i always order from uber eats and never had a problem except for a few days ago,1
686,4193,ubereats,1058959277,2022-09-26 18:21:52,Didn't get a refund for cancellation,i ordered 40 worth of qdoba food and i realized i was missing an item i then cancelled my order which was 2 mins after realizing and then it said i was charged for cancellation,1
686,4194,ubereats,1058959277,2022-09-26 18:21:52,Didn't get a refund for cancellation,today i contacted an agent and they told me due to their policy i could not get a refund,1
686,4195,ubereats,1058959277,2022-09-26 18:21:52,Didn't get a refund for cancellation,also after i canceled my order i ordered more food and then when it came i was missing an item i called the person who delivered it multiple times and she never  answered i also called qdoba and they could not do anything about it,1
686,4196,ubereats,1058959277,2022-09-26 18:21:52,Didn't get a refund for cancellation,i have never experienced anything like this before and i am very disappointed with my experience,1
687,4197,ubereats,1058959277,2022-09-25 01:31:13,Should be better,would be a four but prices are getting out of control in general,3
687,4198,ubereats,1058959277,2022-09-25 01:31:13,Should be better,largest issue is that the app will not default to your nearest location even when ordering from the same franchise,3
687,4199,ubereats,1058959277,2022-09-25 01:31:13,Should be better,multiple times i have had to cancel or wait longer than i should because it auto picks a location 8 miles away when the same eateries are located less than a mile away,3
687,4200,ubereats,1058959277,2022-09-25 01:31:13,Should be better,lastly menu options do not reflect what is actually available from a location and alterations are not sometimes possible on the app when it would not be an issue in person,3
688,4201,ubereats,1058959277,2022-09-11 20:33:21,UberEATS are THIEVES,i definitely would not recommend this app,1
688,4202,ubereats,1058959277,2022-09-11 20:33:21,UberEATS are THIEVES,i am going elsewhere,1
688,4203,ubereats,1058959277,2022-09-11 20:33:21,UberEATS are THIEVES,i literally ordered curry goat from a jamaican restaurant yesterday they sent me curry chicken,1
688,4204,ubereats,1058959277,2022-09-11 20:33:21,UberEATS are THIEVES,i called the restaurant and the restaurant said they were calling uber to give me a credit because they realize they made a mistake,1
688,4205,ubereats,1058959277,2022-09-11 20:33:21,UberEATS are THIEVES,uber will not give me a refund because i previously reported another restaurant for not giving me the correct order as well as another for having here and my food which i always provide evidence,1
688,4206,ubereats,1058959277,2022-09-11 20:33:21,UberEATS are THIEVES,so because other restaurants make a mistake i have to be penalized for it,1
688,4207,ubereats,1058959277,2022-09-11 20:33:21,UberEATS are THIEVES,pretty much they stole my money,1
688,4208,ubereats,1058959277,2022-09-11 20:33:21,UberEATS are THIEVES,gave me something that i did not ask for and said sorry lol i am deactivating my account and there is no promotion that they can give me to make me come back,1
689,4209,ubereats,1058959277,2022-11-19 03:02:15,Major Flaw,what really bothers me about this app is if the order does not go through because either a declined payment or the restaurant is out of an item instead of sending a notification to you it just does not submit the order and waits for you to open the app again,3
689,4210,ubereats,1058959277,2022-11-19 03:02:15,Major Flaw,this has happened to me twice in the past two weeks where i open the app 3040 minutes later to check the order status and it turns out that my order never even went through but now i cannot fix the problem because the restaurant closed,3
689,4211,ubereats,1058959277,2022-11-19 03:02:15,Major Flaw,incredibly annoying,3
689,4212,ubereats,1058959277,2022-11-19 03:02:15,Major Flaw,please fix this,3
690,4213,ubereats,1058959277,2022-11-18 17:09:15,"Buggy, does not let you order, randomly.",with chickfila orders the app does not let me select any of the required sides and drinks,1
690,4214,ubereats,1058959277,2022-11-18 17:09:15,"Buggy, does not let you order, randomly.",the second i tap on my soda the whole order is canceled,1
690,4215,ubereats,1058959277,2022-11-18 17:09:15,"Buggy, does not let you order, randomly.",this is also happening with local restaurantsmy other favorite feature is when the search shows you dozens of restaurants but when you tap them it warns you this place will close in 3 minutes,1
690,4216,ubereats,1058959277,2022-11-18 17:09:15,"Buggy, does not let you order, randomly.",if the business hours are available why not show them in the search results or filter places that are closing soonall in all uber is ran by venture capitalists and overpaid programmers in silicon valley and they underpay their contractors who actually get the job done,1
690,4217,ubereats,1058959277,2022-11-18 17:09:15,"Buggy, does not let you order, randomly.",i want to stop using it but the alternatives are not much better,1
691,4218,ubereats,1058959277,2022-11-16 14:58:59,Why so much increase in money?,i appreciate the convenience and am willing to pay and tip well but explain to me why they food or drinks have an increase in price when ordered through the app uber eats or door dash plus the deliver fee of 2 or more dollars plus the tip,3
691,4219,ubereats,1058959277,2022-11-16 14:58:59,Why so much increase in money?,so uber eats how much money are you making,3
691,4220,ubereats,1058959277,2022-11-16 14:58:59,Why so much increase in money?,does the restaurant i am ordering from see the profits of the dollar or more increase on the product or is that your profitthis has caused me to change my mind and not use these platform,3
691,4221,ubereats,1058959277,2022-11-16 14:58:59,Why so much increase in money?,i am going to put my money in the restaurants so they are still here for us to enjoy instead of bankrupt from this corruption,3
692,4222,ubereats,1058959277,2022-12-03 15:29:27,Great except for communication and delivery times,i love using the app and ability to order from many restaurants but when there is a problem with an order it is difficult that you cannot speak to someone,3
692,4223,ubereats,1058959277,2022-12-03 15:29:27,Great except for communication and delivery times,sometimes it is resolved properly and others it is not,3
692,4224,ubereats,1058959277,2022-12-03 15:29:27,Great except for communication and delivery times,also when you pay for priority delivery or even just regular delivery and the time increases 15 minutes from the latest time originally stated it is not fair to have to pay for priority still and not being able to do anything about it being so much later than originally stated which happens often,3
693,4225,ubereats,1058959277,2022-11-09 23:01:50,"The app is pretty cool, but…",the app is pretty cool i have always had good experiences with delivery  but 1,4
693,4226,ubereats,1058959277,2022-11-09 23:01:50,"The app is pretty cool, but…",prices are often higher now for each item thus used to distinguish uber esta from doordash in usa,4
693,4228,ubereats,1058959277,2022-11-09 23:01:50,"The app is pretty cool, but…",moreover there are additional charges for uber such that even paying for the premium you are not breaking even before tip,4
693,4230,ubereats,1058959277,2022-11-09 23:01:50,"The app is pretty cool, but…",if you go to a new place it does not realize that you are traveling,4
693,4231,ubereats,1058959277,2022-11-09 23:01:50,"The app is pretty cool, but…",this can lead to some confusion while you look for restaurants that you know should be there maybe even cause you to order from the wrong restaurant i imagine,4
694,4232,ubereats,1058959277,2022-09-26 13:18:31,Don't deserve NO stars!,i been using uber just because i have little kids with no help,1
694,4233,ubereats,1058959277,2022-09-26 13:18:31,Don't deserve NO stars!,never fails to give me the worst experience,1
694,4234,ubereats,1058959277,2022-09-26 13:18:31,Don't deserve NO stars!,order always takes longer and the food gets here cold bad shape missing items because drivers do not take a second to make sure everything is ok,1
694,4235,ubereats,1058959277,2022-09-26 13:18:31,Don't deserve NO stars!,adding to that drivers take multiple pick ups,1
694,4236,ubereats,1058959277,2022-09-26 13:18:31,Don't deserve NO stars!,customer service is the worse ever,1
694,4237,ubereats,1058959277,2022-09-26 13:18:31,Don't deserve NO stars!,refunds un most cases i do not get back,1
694,4238,ubereats,1058959277,2022-09-26 13:18:31,Don't deserve NO stars!,you pay a lot of money for a service that do not have nothing to do with you after somethings goes wrong,1
694,4239,ubereats,1058959277,2022-09-26 13:18:31,Don't deserve NO stars!,drivers are crap amd do not care how much you spent they just want to make as much deliveries possible to make money and they expect a tip on top of that,1
694,4240,ubereats,1058959277,2022-09-26 13:18:31,Don't deserve NO stars!,delivering cold damage and missing items for you,1
695,4241,ubereats,1058959277,2022-12-08 06:15:22,Terrible service from app and driver,my burger king order was 50 minutes late 1115 from being picked up so i decided to cancel and order at another place,1
695,4242,ubereats,1058959277,2022-12-08 06:15:22,Terrible service from app and driver,i was not informed that cancelling the order would have made it so that i could not even order food at all because it stops at 1030 in my area,1
695,4243,ubereats,1058959277,2022-12-08 06:15:22,Terrible service from app and driver,this night my five guys order took 90 minutes to get cancelled by the driver,1
695,4244,ubereats,1058959277,2022-12-08 06:15:22,Terrible service from app and driver,the driver had asked me an hour prior to the cancellation for my address because the app was bugging out which it was so i gave it to him,1
695,4245,ubereats,1058959277,2022-12-08 06:15:22,Terrible service from app and driver,no status updates for 40 minutes so i message him and 10 minutes later he cancels my order after reading my messages,1
695,4246,ubereats,1058959277,2022-12-08 06:15:22,Terrible service from app and driver,after two experiences like this i am highly unlikely to order from uber eats again,1
696,4247,ubereats,1058959277,2022-10-04 01:47:14,This app is not good,gives a list of places from which to order you begin order then when placing it tells you restaurant is now closed,2
696,4248,ubereats,1058959277,2022-10-04 01:47:14,This app is not good,does not give a warning that it may close within 3 minutes of starting your order,2
696,4249,ubereats,1058959277,2022-10-04 01:47:14,This app is not good,app is not stable and crashes,2
696,4250,ubereats,1058959277,2022-10-04 01:47:14,This app is not good,found new restaurant spent about 57 minutes placing order went to check out and app was non responsive to the checkout button,2
696,4251,ubereats,1058959277,2022-10-04 01:47:14,This app is not good,you could add more things to your order or view info about the restaurant but still could not complete the purchase,2
696,4252,ubereats,1058959277,2022-10-04 01:47:14,This app is not good,restarted app and placed order all over worked this time,2
696,4253,ubereats,1058959277,2022-10-04 01:47:14,This app is not good,really sad considering the markup and todays technological advances,2
697,4254,ubereats,1058959277,2022-10-03 03:39:19,Almost 5 Stars!,uber eats is hands down the best food delivery service and until recently i would have given the 5stars but i have noticed them trying to sneak in the same outsized fees which drove me away from doordash and grubhub permanently,4
697,4255,ubereats,1058959277,2022-10-03 03:39:19,Almost 5 Stars!,my hope is that they do not sabotage themselves with those extraentreesized fees because they usually mean the difference between me ordering via an app or going to get my own takeout,4
697,4256,ubereats,1058959277,2022-10-03 03:39:19,Almost 5 Stars!,i will never pay the same price for a delivery experience as i do for an eatin restaurant experience so be careful what fees you slip in there,4
698,4257,ubereats,1058959277,2022-09-24 03:19:52,Would have could have,mod pizza had an option to add sauce on top of their pizza at the end just like in person if you were to order,4
698,4258,ubereats,1058959277,2022-09-24 03:19:52,Would have could have,but they got rid of or do not have that option to add their previous sauces that they normally provide as options at the end in person via the app here,4
698,4259,ubereats,1058959277,2022-09-24 03:19:52,Would have could have,it is late and i just wanted to have the same experience with options but i am guessing due to complying with the chains rules and updated regulations i do not have those options anymore,4
698,4260,ubereats,1058959277,2022-09-24 03:19:52,Would have could have,i think the chains should really come together and figure out geolocations where if you are in a certain town that will allow additional last sauce toppings it should be more intuitive and allowed instead of a general overall consensus of the franchise decision to make every single pizza place comply with locational standards,4
698,4261,ubereats,1058959277,2022-09-24 03:19:52,Would have could have,not fair to people that know the menu and then get cut on location regulations and restrictions,4
699,4262,ubereats,1058959277,2022-11-22 19:41:21,Customer Service is not great,when there is a problem with the order and you have to talk to an agent it is such a pain and so time consuming,3
699,4263,ubereats,1058959277,2022-11-22 19:41:21,Customer Service is not great,sure they will give you a refund if the order is wrong or damaged but when it is time to give you a credit you must ask for it and the credit will be so small,3
699,4264,ubereats,1058959277,2022-11-22 19:41:21,Customer Service is not great,it is amazing how it seems like they want you to tip the drivers but when it is time for them to give a credit it does not cover anything more than the tip you give a driver,3
699,4265,ubereats,1058959277,2022-11-22 19:41:21,Customer Service is not great,if you are tipping the driver then the credit is what covers their tip and you get nothing more for the inconvenience,3
700,4266,ubereats,1058959277,2022-09-11 11:26:58,Customer Service,my family ordered a pizza using uber eats service,1
700,4267,ubereats,1058959277,2022-09-11 11:26:58,Customer Service,our pizza took a good amount of time and came ice cold and tasted rubbery,1
700,4268,ubereats,1058959277,2022-09-11 11:26:58,Customer Service,we contacted uber eats immediately and was told sorry there is nothing they can do,1
700,4269,ubereats,1058959277,2022-09-11 11:26:58,Customer Service,so you pay extra to order through their service for convenience but they accept zero responsibility and told me to contact the establishment,1
700,4270,ubereats,1058959277,2022-09-11 11:26:58,Customer Service,the establishment loses money because some of their price goes toward uber eats,1
700,4271,ubereats,1058959277,2022-09-11 11:26:58,Customer Service,so basically the customer pays extra to use their service for convenience and the establishment pays toward uber eats losing profit but uber eats accepts zero responsibility that they are serving anything with quality,1
700,4272,ubereats,1058959277,2022-09-11 11:26:58,Customer Service,it is absolutely horrible business service,1
700,4273,ubereats,1058959277,2022-09-11 11:26:58,Customer Service,use grub hub instacart or just order through the establishment,1
700,4274,ubereats,1058959277,2022-09-11 11:26:58,Customer Service,uber eats is trash,1
701,4275,ubereats,1058959277,2022-11-20 01:06:32,"Love the app, hate the service fees",love this app hate the service fees,4
701,4276,ubereats,1058959277,2022-11-20 01:06:32,"Love the app, hate the service fees",it is next to impossible to get a hold of anyone to resolve any issues that arise and not easy to get refunds,4
701,4277,ubereats,1058959277,2022-11-20 01:06:32,"Love the app, hate the service fees",this app is a necessity however for all those late cold and rainy nights and the days and nights where there is nothing for miles,4
701,4278,ubereats,1058959277,2022-11-20 01:06:32,"Love the app, hate the service fees",my two biggest pet peeves are that they allow people on bicycles to deliver so if the driver does not insulate your food properly it will be cold and the fact that it asks you to tip as you are completing your order,4
701,4279,ubereats,1058959277,2022-11-20 01:06:32,"Love the app, hate the service fees",it is like let us see how the service is right,4
702,4280,ubereats,1058959277,2022-12-03 09:04:41,Horrible customer service!!,uber eats does not care about it is customers does not care about our concerns or anything be prepared to order food and possibly not receive all of your items and if that happens mind you it happens often be ready for them to tell you that  you are not eligible for a refund,1
702,4281,ubereats,1058959277,2022-12-03 09:04:41,Horrible customer service!!,it is the most absolute terrible display of customer service i have ever experienced,1

703,4285,ubereats,1058959277,2022-11-13 09:50:42,Notification disaster,if you turn off notifications  you do not know where your driver is,1
703,4286,ubereats,1058959277,2022-11-13 09:50:42,Notification disaster,if you leave on notifications  you get bombarded with ads for junk food you never in a million years would order  all day long,1
703,4287,ubereats,1058959277,2022-11-13 09:50:42,Notification disaster,app is a total failure and makes it unusable as far as i am concerned for this reason,1
703,4288,ubereats,1058959277,2022-11-13 09:50:42,Notification disaster,no one wants coupons all day,1
703,4289,ubereats,1058959277,2022-11-13 09:50:42,Notification disaster,further  their drivers often make more than one stop  taking far far longer than if you order from the restaurant direct,1
703,4290,ubereats,1058959277,2022-11-13 09:50:42,Notification disaster,i got food poisoning the last time and have had dangerous delivery drivers lie about their location,1
703,4291,ubereats,1058959277,2022-11-13 09:50:42,Notification disaster,uber refunded me  but nonetheless  ordering direct from the restaurant eliminates all of this an is always at least 25 cheaper,1
704,4292,ubereats,1058959277,2022-11-05 22:01:15,Frustrated,had a driver steal my food for the first time last night,1
704,4293,ubereats,1058959277,2022-11-05 22:01:15,Frustrated,first the order was delayed which i was not too concerned about since they gave me a 5 credit for the inconvenience,1
704,4294,ubereats,1058959277,2022-11-05 22:01:15,Frustrated,the driver claimed my order was at the door but no order,1
704,4295,ubereats,1058959277,2022-11-05 22:01:15,Frustrated,i contacted customer service and they told me my order was not eligible for a refund because it showed that the driver reached the drop off location,1
704,4296,ubereats,1058959277,2022-11-05 22:01:15,Frustrated,this is terrible customer service,1
704,4297,ubereats,1058959277,2022-11-05 22:01:15,Frustrated,i have never had this issue or had a complaint until now and yet i could not get my money back,1
704,4298,ubereats,1058959277,2022-11-05 22:01:15,Frustrated,the rep offered a 10 credit and never even provided that,1
704,4299,ubereats,1058959277,2022-11-05 22:01:15,Frustrated,ubereats really needs to do better when it comes to its customers,1
704,4300,ubereats,1058959277,2022-11-05 22:01:15,Frustrated,i never received my food but was treated as if it was my fault,1
705,4301,ubereats,1058959277,2022-10-28 12:05:02,The promos not like they use to,used uber eats often i drive so i order uber eats on lazy days  and it would be either a hit or miss sometimes when it comes to ordering delivery for a good deal,3
705,4302,ubereats,1058959277,2022-10-28 12:05:02,The promos not like they use to,the promotions they use to have were the best because the promo could be used at any restaurant or at least the restaurants in my area that i would normally eat,3
705,4303,ubereats,1058959277,2022-10-28 12:05:02,The promos not like they use to,now the promotions are for places that either does not have a good variety of choices or the prices are 5x as more as what i would would spend normally so the promo is not really a promo,3
705,4304,ubereats,1058959277,2022-10-28 12:05:02,The promos not like they use to,please stop being greedy and let me choose my places to eat,3
706,4305,ubereats,1058959277,2022-10-21 23:07:23,You can take bets that the order will not arrive as described,i almost never write comments or reviews,1
706,4306,ubereats,1058959277,2022-10-21 23:07:23,You can take bets that the order will not arrive as described,this one has been overdue for sometime now,1
706,4307,ubereats,1058959277,2022-10-21 23:07:23,You can take bets that the order will not arrive as described,i have lost track of how many times did i not receive the correct order sometimes items ordered were missing and other times the order itself was missing,1
706,4308,ubereats,1058959277,2022-10-21 23:07:23,You can take bets that the order will not arrive as described,i know it is not uber who prepares the food however they sure deliver it and that is the company i pay,1
706,4309,ubereats,1058959277,2022-10-21 23:07:23,You can take bets that the order will not arrive as described,it would be extremely nice for a driver to verify the food items may be not open the boxes before they pick it up,1
706,4310,ubereats,1058959277,2022-10-21 23:07:23,You can take bets that the order will not arrive as described,i am very dissatisfied with uber yet i order from them cause i have found very many options on other apps,1
706,4311,ubereats,1058959277,2022-10-21 23:07:23,You can take bets that the order will not arrive as described,i would love to be an uber member if they can improve this for me,1
707,4312,ubereats,1058959277,2022-10-05 14:27:47,Terrible! Do not use Uber Eats/Postmates,i have ordered using uber eats multiple times and time after time my orders arrive wrong,1
707,4313,ubereats,1058959277,2022-10-05 14:27:47,Terrible! Do not use Uber Eats/Postmates,they do not hold the restaurants or drivers accountable at all,1
707,4314,ubereats,1058959277,2022-10-05 14:27:47,Terrible! Do not use Uber Eats/Postmates,there are no places for notes and they decide to not refund your money if you have had refunds in the past,1
707,4315,ubereats,1058959277,2022-10-05 14:27:47,Terrible! Do not use Uber Eats/Postmates,it is not our fault that they do not have any quality control measures within the system they are creating,1
707,4316,ubereats,1058959277,2022-10-05 14:27:47,Terrible! Do not use Uber Eats/Postmates,i basically paid 50 for two child subs literally and two drinks i did not order,1
707,4317,ubereats,1058959277,2022-10-05 14:27:47,Terrible! Do not use Uber Eats/Postmates,after reviewing they pretty much said sorry for this but no refund,1
707,4318,ubereats,1058959277,2022-10-05 14:27:47,Terrible! Do not use Uber Eats/Postmates,basically by using this app you are prepaying for a goodservice you may or may not receive,1
707,4319,ubereats,1058959277,2022-10-05 14:27:47,Terrible! Do not use Uber Eats/Postmates,it is not worth it for all the delivery fees and up charges,1
708,4320,ubereats,1058959277,2022-09-27 19:46:48,Something is wrong,i am not sure how to get in touch with anyone in this company but you are over charging for taxes on food,3
708,4321,ubereats,1058959277,2022-09-27 19:46:48,Something is wrong,i want to see the additional charges on the receipt and where they are going,3
708,4322,ubereats,1058959277,2022-09-27 19:46:48,Something is wrong,this seems very suspicious,3
708,4323,ubereats,1058959277,2022-09-27 19:46:48,Something is wrong,then you calculate the tip by the highest amount before any discounts,3
708,4324,ubereats,1058959277,2022-09-27 19:46:48,Something is wrong,i would like proof the drivers actually receives the full amount,3
708,4325,ubereats,1058959277,2022-09-27 19:46:48,Something is wrong,seems odd to calculate tip by the price of food and not the distance they drive,3
708,4326,ubereats,1058959277,2022-09-27 19:46:48,Something is wrong,they have no association with the restaurant you are ordering from,3
708,4327,ubereats,1058959277,2022-09-27 19:46:48,Something is wrong,it should require a higher tip the further away the restaurant is from the delivery address,3
709,4328,ubereats,1058959277,2022-11-15 13:01:28,Incorrect Items/Billing,billed me for incorrect items,1
709,4329,ubereats,1058959277,2022-11-15 13:01:28,Incorrect Items/Billing,i brought it up when the issue was discovered 2 days later as item was a bouquet of flowers and i ordered them for my wife while out of town,1
709,4330,ubereats,1058959277,2022-11-15 13:01:28,Incorrect Items/Billing,uber eats refused to address this said i should rate the merchant,1
709,4331,ubereats,1058959277,2022-11-15 13:01:28,Incorrect Items/Billing,i took it up with the credit card company who refunded me,1
709,4332,ubereats,1058959277,2022-11-15 13:01:28,Incorrect Items/Billing,uber eats billed my other credit card on file without authorization,1
709,4333,ubereats,1058959277,2022-11-15 13:01:28,Incorrect Items/Billing,took up the issue with the second credit card company who again refunded me,1
709,4334,ubereats,1058959277,2022-11-15 13:01:28,Incorrect Items/Billing,six months later uber eats billed me the incorrect amount again for the previous order,1
709,4335,ubereats,1058959277,2022-11-15 13:01:28,Incorrect Items/Billing,uber eats continues to say there is nothing they can do and that i should be on the hook for paying more than 2x the purchase price of the product i received,1
710,4336,ubereats,1058959277,2022-11-06 05:07:38,Do not recommend- VERY UNHELPFUL CUSTOMER SUPPORT,i was considering switching from doordash to ubereats until i made an order and received no driver info or tracking capabilities,1
710,4337,ubereats,1058959277,2022-11-06 05:07:38,Do not recommend- VERY UNHELPFUL CUSTOMER SUPPORT,ubereats said order was delivered yet i did not have photo confirmation and it never actually did show up,1
710,4338,ubereats,1058959277,2022-11-06 05:07:38,Do not recommend- VERY UNHELPFUL CUSTOMER SUPPORT,i contacted support and they told me i entered in an address i never heard of and refused refund even though my confirmation email had the correct address,1
710,4339,ubereats,1058959277,2022-11-06 05:07:38,Do not recommend- VERY UNHELPFUL CUSTOMER SUPPORT,i had to call and they told me they would make a one time exception to refund me since they said i did not provide the correct address despite never using a different address and having confirmation of the address sent to me and shown on the app,1
710,4340,ubereats,1058959277,2022-11-06 05:07:38,Do not recommend- VERY UNHELPFUL CUSTOMER SUPPORT,way sketchy compared to my experience with doordash no thanks,1
711,4341,ubereats,1058959277,2022-11-02 01:38:31,Awful Cancellation Policy,2 hours after my friend and i were supposed to have our food delivered we contacted our delivery driver to ask what the delay was,1
711,4342,ubereats,1058959277,2022-11-02 01:38:31,Awful Cancellation Policy,she cancelled our order,1
711,4343,ubereats,1058959277,2022-11-02 01:38:31,Awful Cancellation Policy,it is pretty clear that she dined and dashed,1
711,4344,ubereats,1058959277,2022-11-02 01:38:31,Awful Cancellation Policy,i am sure she will be punished but that does not help me,1
711,4345,ubereats,1058959277,2022-11-02 01:38:31,Awful Cancellation Policy,the issue is that at 9 pm we have no food that will be delivered before 10 and uber eats policy apparently does not allow customer support to do more than refund the order,1
711,4346,ubereats,1058959277,2022-11-02 01:38:31,Awful Cancellation Policy,for our wasted time in which the app assured us it would just take 5 minutes longer for a good hour we got nothing besides 10 dollars in uber eats credits,1
711,4347,ubereats,1058959277,2022-11-02 01:38:31,Awful Cancellation Policy,it is not worth it to spend that on this app where i end up hungry and angry and eating at 10 pm,1
711,4348,ubereats,1058959277,2022-11-02 01:38:31,Awful Cancellation Policy,do not waste your time,1

712,4350,ubereats,1058959277,2022-10-04 22:58:31,HORRIBLE EXPERIENCE,i repeatedly tried to order food from uber eats as a first time customer because i have heard so many good things about uber eats but it went horribly wrong,1
712,4351,ubereats,1058959277,2022-10-04 22:58:31,HORRIBLE EXPERIENCE,i set up an acc and tried to order food yesterday it was not working i spent the whole day trying to figure out what was going on but nothing was working i went the whole day without eating because i put my time and energy into trying to make ot work but after all the effort iput in i still couldnt get a simple mcdonalds,1
712,4352,ubereats,1058959277,2022-10-04 22:58:31,HORRIBLE EXPERIENCE,the following day i was determined because everyone was saying that uber eats is so much better then doordash but now im finding it hard to believe,1
712,4353,ubereats,1058959277,2022-10-04 22:58:31,HORRIBLE EXPERIENCE,i tried using the promotion of geting but 20 off but i was saying it promo not applied i had an order of 25 yet it still didnt work,1
712,4354,ubereats,1058959277,2022-10-04 22:58:31,HORRIBLE EXPERIENCE,the whole entire 2days it was one problem after another the order wasnt work then my payment was working and even after all that i still had hope i used the uber app and uber eats app but nothing would work,1
712,4355,ubereats,1058959277,2022-10-04 22:58:31,HORRIBLE EXPERIENCE,all i waned was some mcdonlads for me and my sister but i couldnt even get that i even tried to pay for it without the promotions but nothing would work,1

713,4357,ubereats,1058959277,2022-09-23 11:27:06,Annoying Notifications,would be five stars except for one very annoying problem,1
713,4358,ubereats,1058959277,2022-09-23 11:27:06,Annoying Notifications,the app will send random notifications that are nothing more than advertisements for uber eats,1
713,4359,ubereats,1058959277,2022-09-23 11:27:06,Annoying Notifications,i want the notifications when i actually order something so that the driver can contact me if needed,1
713,4360,ubereats,1058959277,2022-09-23 11:27:06,Annoying Notifications,but if i forget to turn off the notifications i will inevitably be woken up by a stupid advertisement a day or two later,1
713,4361,ubereats,1058959277,2022-09-23 11:27:06,Annoying Notifications,seriously uber eats if i trust you to be able to give me notifications for the purpose of using the app as intended please do not violate that trust by sending unwanted notifications that are nothing more than an advertisement especially in the middle of the night or early in the morning,1
714,4362,ubereats,1058959277,2022-10-01 18:47:49,Uber Eats,uber eats is a great service,5
714,4363,ubereats,1058959277,2022-10-01 18:47:49,Uber Eats,but the last time i ordered from panda express was less then pleasant,5
714,4364,ubereats,1058959277,2022-10-01 18:47:49,Uber Eats,is it just me or are the portions getting smaller and smaller,5
714,4365,ubereats,1058959277,2022-10-01 18:47:49,Uber Eats,they modify their boxes so they do not give you as much food,5
714,4366,ubereats,1058959277,2022-10-01 18:47:49,Uber Eats,it is disturbing,5
714,4367,ubereats,1058959277,2022-10-01 18:47:49,Uber Eats,charge whatever you need to but i want what i want,5
714,4368,ubereats,1058959277,2022-10-01 18:47:49,Uber Eats,i ordered from panda express today again and this will be my last if the quality and quantity is not there,5
714,4369,ubereats,1058959277,2022-10-01 18:47:49,Uber Eats,i want my fried rice to be full,5
714,4370,ubereats,1058959277,2022-10-01 18:47:49,Uber Eats,and my beijing beef,5
714,4371,ubereats,1058959277,2022-10-01 18:47:49,Uber Eats,if not there will not be anymore ordering from this restaurant,5
715,4372,ubereats,1058959277,2022-12-04 20:18:07,terrible customer service,when you have issues with an order they connect you with a bot not a live person and it is impossible to find a way to contact a live person,1
715,4373,ubereats,1058959277,2022-12-04 20:18:07,terrible customer service,i have run into issues countless times where it charges me for an order and will not connect to a driver so i sit there waiting for hours until it cancels on their end,1
715,4374,ubereats,1058959277,2022-12-04 20:18:07,terrible customer service,i tried canceling on my end this time because i did not want to waste my time and the app prompted me to cancel and did not refund me at all i finally got a hold of a live person and they told me it was in the terms that no refunds are given so now i am without food and money,1
715,4375,ubereats,1058959277,2022-12-04 20:18:07,terrible customer service,what a load of crap this app is terrible and i will never be using it again,1
716,4376,ubereats,1058959277,2022-09-17 14:24:26,They would not refund you for missing items,i had few missing items on my uber eat order,1
716,4377,ubereats,1058959277,2022-09-17 14:24:26,They would not refund you for missing items,i called the restaurant they told me to see with uber eats,1
716,4378,ubereats,1058959277,2022-09-17 14:24:26,They would not refund you for missing items,after a long back and forth with robots answering they said my purchase was not eligible for refund and that my account had too many refund requeststhis was my first time asking for a refund,1
716,4379,ubereats,1058959277,2022-09-17 14:24:26,They would not refund you for missing items,i was shocked to hear that their first answer was the quality of my account which was they based on wrong information,1
716,4380,ubereats,1058959277,2022-09-17 14:24:26,They would not refund you for missing items,they would not bring this up to  a supervisor  of course this only a robot answering always the same crafted response this is just too risky to order on this site and prefer grub hub for their management of the same issue,1
717,4381,ubereats,1058959277,2022-11-13 08:01:59,Dustin,i have been purchasing from and working with uber eats for over two years now,5
717,4382,ubereats,1058959277,2022-11-13 08:01:59,Dustin,the platform and the people who work with them are seamless and i say this both as a customer and a partner,5
717,4383,ubereats,1058959277,2022-11-13 08:01:59,Dustin,in a pinch i am able to order food onthespot and as a partner i am able to work on my own schedule and thus far i feel like uber treats me fairly as a partner which is so important to me as i run and manage my own business,5
717,4384,ubereats,1058959277,2022-11-13 08:01:59,Dustin,thanks uber and to those who support all of us,5
718,4385,ubereats,1058959277,2022-12-02 17:36:57,Uber delivery taking too long,uber eats takes way too long to deliver,3
718,4386,ubereats,1058959277,2022-12-02 17:36:57,Uber delivery taking too long,it does not matter if the place you are ordering from is near or far from you,3

718,4388,ubereats,1058959277,2022-12-02 17:36:57,Uber delivery taking too long,sometimes the latest arrival is an hour after i place the order that is unacceptable,3
718,4389,ubereats,1058959277,2022-12-02 17:36:57,Uber delivery taking too long,it is unacceptable that if i place an order at 11 am that the latest arrival is 1225 pm,3
718,4390,ubereats,1058959277,2022-12-02 17:36:57,Uber delivery taking too long,by that time my order is cold and i am upset because i have had to wait over an hour for an order that should have taken about 30 minutes to deliver to me or less,3
719,4391,ubereats,1058959277,2022-11-30 19:28:34,Worst experience of my life,i ordered a large starbucks order so that i could get the 25 discount thing on my first order and the driver,1
719,4392,ubereats,1058959277,2022-11-30 19:28:34,Worst experience of my life,micheal sent it to the wrong address and i called him telling him so,1
719,4393,ubereats,1058959277,2022-11-30 19:28:34,Worst experience of my life,he told me to wait till after he was done with the order he was working on and i did because i am a pleasant person and the order never showed up and i cannot find a way to contact him again,1
719,4394,ubereats,1058959277,2022-11-30 19:28:34,Worst experience of my life,so i issued a refund to my uber eats account so i could reorder my order and no i do not get the first order discount so i cannot use the money and have to spend more money if i want the same order and i am still waiting on the first order because he said he would bring it but he never dead,1
719,4395,ubereats,1058959277,2022-11-30 19:28:34,Worst experience of my life,very sad,1
720,4396,ubereats,1058959277,2022-10-08 13:31:01,Biggest scam ever,i will no longer be using this app after my latest experience,1
720,4397,ubereats,1058959277,2022-10-08 13:31:01,Biggest scam ever,ordered delivery around 5pm food was probably ready around 530 but the driver kept getting lost and once they finally picked the food up they delivered it to the wrong address,1
720,4398,ubereats,1058959277,2022-10-08 13:31:01,Biggest scam ever,i demanded a full refund through the app which thankfully i got but cmon you mean to tell me your drivers cannot even get the address right,1
720,4399,ubereats,1058959277,2022-10-08 13:31:01,Biggest scam ever,i could have easily gone out and got it myself which is exactly what i will be doing from now on instead of using this moneygrabbing scam of an app ever again,1
720,4400,ubereats,1058959277,2022-10-08 13:31:01,Biggest scam ever,believe me you do not wanna waste your time and money with this app,1
720,4401,ubereats,1058959277,2022-10-08 13:31:01,Biggest scam ever,you are much better off ordering delivery through the restaurant itself,1
721,4402,ubereats,1058959277,2022-10-07 01:49:48,Uber Eats,this was the last time i use uber eats,1
721,4403,ubereats,1058959277,2022-10-07 01:49:48,Uber Eats,the app platform has apparently been modified to discourage any of their users to complain about an order,1
721,4404,ubereats,1058959277,2022-10-07 01:49:48,Uber Eats,on several occasions they have automatically entered a tip when none was given due to poor service eg dropped out front before anyone could get there and the food was taken live in an urban setting,1
721,4405,ubereats,1058959277,2022-10-07 01:49:48,Uber Eats,on attempting to view the receipt you are informed to look at in 24 hours apparently assuming correctly that most people will not come back to it,1
721,4406,ubereats,1058959277,2022-10-07 01:49:48,Uber Eats,lastly they will not allow you to use the microphone on your phone so you have to type everything out maybe door dash or another app provider is better i guess i will find out,1
721,4407,ubereats,1058959277,2022-10-07 01:49:48,Uber Eats,done with uber,1
722,4408,ubereats,1058959277,2022-11-28 05:59:43,Late Night,i just want to give a shout to uber eats tonite,5
722,4409,ubereats,1058959277,2022-11-28 05:59:43,Late Night,had a rough day and needed food last minute,5
722,4410,ubereats,1058959277,2022-11-28 05:59:43,Late Night,there was not anyone to deliver in enough time at first until a driver decided to take a night owl trip,5
722,4411,ubereats,1058959277,2022-11-28 05:59:43,Late Night,they deserve kudos for making my delivery happen so late,5
722,4412,ubereats,1058959277,2022-11-28 05:59:43,Late Night,not many places are open this late so i was very grateful to receive my order,5

722,4414,ubereats,1058959277,2022-11-28 05:59:43,Late Night,so to the driver who i am not naming for privacy purposes who delivered my food late at night you are the bomb,5
722,4415,ubereats,1058959277,2022-11-28 05:59:43,Late Night,thank you,5
723,4416,ubereats,1058959277,2022-10-31 00:13:46,Super inconvenient when orders get canceled,3 times already my orders have been cancelled while i was at work,3
723,4417,ubereats,1058959277,2022-10-31 00:13:46,Super inconvenient when orders get canceled,normally i would not have cared but i was not notified till one hour after i put in my order leaving me no time to reorder and leaving me hungry during my 12 hour work shifts,3
723,4418,ubereats,1058959277,2022-10-31 00:13:46,Super inconvenient when orders get canceled,there are people like me that rely on this service,3
723,4419,ubereats,1058959277,2022-10-31 00:13:46,Super inconvenient when orders get canceled,no i have heard my coworkers say well just bring lunch that only solves my problem and not the problem on the app,3
723,4420,ubereats,1058959277,2022-10-31 00:13:46,Super inconvenient when orders get canceled,for the most part i enjoy this app and they are accurate and communicate well but this has not been the case my 3 orders from subway,3
724,4421,ubereats,1058959277,2022-10-11 01:08:25,Worst app,i have ordered frommcdonalds several times this year and every time mcdonalds never sends me what i order,1
724,4422,ubereats,1058959277,2022-10-11 01:08:25,Worst app,i have lost countless times money and all uber says that they cannot do anything because i have exceeded the limit,1
724,4423,ubereats,1058959277,2022-10-11 01:08:25,Worst app,so i have to pay a delivery fee which is not cheap plus what we other things they want to charge plus my order from mcdonald and the tip i give the person who delivers and yet i still have to deal with my missing items from mcdonalds,1
724,4424,ubereats,1058959277,2022-10-11 01:08:25,Worst app,i wrote to those people and told uber to check my history on other places to see if i have ever reported something missing from my order and the answer to that is no,1
724,4425,ubereats,1058959277,2022-10-11 01:08:25,Worst app,zero would be best for this stupid app,1
724,4426,ubereats,1058959277,2022-10-11 01:08:25,Worst app,uber are thieves and so is mcdonalds,1
725,4427,ubereats,1058959277,2022-10-30 17:57:46,Horrible,this used to be a good quality delivery service that at least got your order delivered within an hour of the estimated delivery time,1
725,4428,ubereats,1058959277,2022-10-30 17:57:46,Horrible,now if it does show up it is two hours late and the food is not edible,1
725,4429,ubereats,1058959277,2022-10-30 17:57:46,Horrible,you can watch your order and see it get picked up then sit in the delivery drivers car for an extra hour while more pick ups and deliveries are made keep in mind this is after you have paid for direct delivery,1
725,4430,ubereats,1058959277,2022-10-30 17:57:46,Horrible,i have deleted the app after the fourth time in a row of dealing with this issue,1
725,4431,ubereats,1058959277,2022-10-30 17:57:46,Horrible,uber does not refund or even believe you when you contact them,1
725,4432,ubereats,1058959277,2022-10-30 17:57:46,Horrible,find a better delivery service and let this company die off,1
725,4433,ubereats,1058959277,2022-10-30 17:57:46,Horrible,plus they treat their drivers horribly,1
726,4434,ubereats,1058959277,2022-10-10 23:38:57,Cancellation after cancellation,cancelled orders day after day shortly after trying out uber eats,1
726,4435,ubereats,1058959277,2022-10-10 23:38:57,Cancellation after cancellation,left grub hub because of their late cancelled wrong address deliveries,1
726,4436,ubereats,1058959277,2022-10-10 23:38:57,Cancellation after cancellation,uber eats has been worse,1
726,4437,ubereats,1058959277,2022-10-10 23:38:57,Cancellation after cancellation,you order says being prepared arriving by latest arrival etc,1
726,4438,ubereats,1058959277,2022-10-10 23:38:57,Cancellation after cancellation,12 hr to over an hour later you get a cancellation order alert leaving family with no dinner,1
726,4439,ubereats,1058959277,2022-10-10 23:38:57,Cancellation after cancellation,plus you lose the promotion for that order,1
726,4440,ubereats,1058959277,2022-10-10 23:38:57,Cancellation after cancellation,reaching customer service is often additional long waiting time or not reached at all,1
726,4441,ubereats,1058959277,2022-10-10 23:38:57,Cancellation after cancellation,trying them out this free month for their uber eats plus type program,1
726,4442,ubereats,1058959277,2022-10-10 23:38:57,Cancellation after cancellation,so far a failure,1
726,4443,ubereats,1058959277,2022-10-10 23:38:57,Cancellation after cancellation,just ordered again and we will see if i get a third straight canceled order alert with no time to choose an alternative,1
727,4445,ubereats,1058959277,2022-09-21 12:33:35,Scammers,i ordered food from uber eats and at the exact same time uber rides charged my card as well,1
727,4446,ubereats,1058959277,2022-09-21 12:33:35,Scammers,they acted like it was something they never seen before even though they are linked apps and obviously give your card and information to other partnered companies to charge your card so do not install this app because your card info goes to other apps to charge your card who knows what other charges id get if i did not notice,1
727,4447,ubereats,1058959277,2022-09-21 12:33:35,Scammers,never got a refund only ran around then sent an email then ignored after my first reply,1
727,4448,ubereats,1058959277,2022-09-21 12:33:35,Scammers,they are obviously scammers,1
727,4449,ubereats,1058959277,2022-09-21 12:33:35,Scammers,promotions are not worth it if they charge your card for a ride to make up for it then play the scammer deck with a skip card in it,1
728,4450,ubereats,1058959277,2022-11-17 05:30:15,Completely unreliable,im a loyal customer that had been ordering lots of food and inevitably sometimes they miss a thing or two so i have to tell them to refund the item myself,1
728,4451,ubereats,1058959277,2022-11-17 05:30:15,Completely unreliable,well after not even having any price adjustments in months they refuse to refund anything off my order even when it is their own fault,1
728,4452,ubereats,1058959277,2022-11-17 05:30:15,Completely unreliable,their systems are faulty and will not refund you if you have had more than a certain amount so you cant rely on them as a delivery service this is outrageous considering how the whole point of having uber one is to be certain your food is here correctly and on time,1
728,4453,ubereats,1058959277,2022-11-17 05:30:15,Completely unreliable,charging me for food that never even got delivered feels more like a scam than a proper service,1
729,4454,ubereats,1058959277,2022-10-26 00:52:30,"Crazy, misleading fees",the app is functional  easy enough to use but the fact the service fees are variable based on price not number or size of items is a rip off,1
729,4455,ubereats,1058959277,2022-10-26 00:52:30,"Crazy, misleading fees",further there is a delivery fee which is separate from the service fee even though the descriptions would lead one to believe it covers the same thing,1
729,4456,ubereats,1058959277,2022-10-26 00:52:30,"Crazy, misleading fees",worst of all the proposed tip starting at 20 is on top of the delivery fee service fee and tax,1
729,4457,ubereats,1058959277,2022-10-26 00:52:30,"Crazy, misleading fees",highway robbery,1
729,4458,ubereats,1058959277,2022-10-26 00:52:30,"Crazy, misleading fees",lastly i have received 3 emails for promotions in the last month all of which when i tried to redeem i was told i am ineligible,1
729,4459,ubereats,1058959277,2022-10-26 00:52:30,"Crazy, misleading fees",then why are you targeting me,1
729,4460,ubereats,1058959277,2022-10-26 00:52:30,"Crazy, misleading fees",i could take a taxi round trip from these restaurants and it would be less money than uber eats,1
729,4461,ubereats,1058959277,2022-10-26 00:52:30,"Crazy, misleading fees",what a rip off,1
730,4462,ubereats,1058959277,2022-10-08 19:06:15,Worst customer service and business model ever,if i could rate zero stars i would,1
730,4463,ubereats,1058959277,2022-10-08 19:06:15,Worst customer service and business model ever,i paid for uber one and i would often use it for delivery and for pickupsconvenient for lunch hour,1
730,4464,ubereats,1058959277,2022-10-08 19:06:15,Worst customer service and business model ever,however literally every time i order delivery there is an issue either a missing item or a completely wrong order,1
730,4465,ubereats,1058959277,2022-10-08 19:06:15,Worst customer service and business model ever,usually to fix this issue is a pain in the rear they hide the options to call in and when you finally can they have you on hold for literal hours,1
730,4466,ubereats,1058959277,2022-10-08 19:06:15,Worst customer service and business model ever,today they refused to refund me for a part of my order that i did not receive bc last time we refunded you,1
730,4467,ubereats,1058959277,2022-10-08 19:06:15,Worst customer service and business model ever,so now i am being faulted for their horrible service,1
730,4468,ubereats,1058959277,2022-10-08 19:06:15,Worst customer service and business model ever,subscription canceled and will never use any uber platform ever again,1
731,4469,ubereats,1058959277,2022-11-25 17:15:56,Terrible Customer Service,i order multiple items including chicken nuggets milkshakes and a chicken sandwich,1
731,4470,ubereats,1058959277,2022-11-25 17:15:56,Terrible Customer Service,my nuggets had pieces of someones hair cooked into the batter as well as i had received the wrong size milkshakes,1
731,4471,ubereats,1058959277,2022-11-25 17:15:56,Terrible Customer Service,i contacted customer service as my wife was unable to eat her food due to the foreign hair that she found in the nuggets,1
731,4472,ubereats,1058959277,2022-11-25 17:15:56,Terrible Customer Service,it took customer service over 8 hours to respond to me and then refused to help my issue due to i had already thrown the food away at this point and they wanted a picture of the hair,1
731,4473,ubereats,1058959277,2022-11-25 17:15:56,Terrible Customer Service,customer service also refused to fix the issue with the milkshake sizes as well,1
731,4474,ubereats,1058959277,2022-11-25 17:15:56,Terrible Customer Service,so i basically got inedible food and got skimped on large milkshakes,1
731,4475,ubereats,1058959277,2022-11-25 17:15:56,Terrible Customer Service,uber eats learn how to treat your customers,1
732,4476,ubereats,1058959277,2022-11-14 01:39:47,Terrible customer service wait,i have never used this until today,3
732,4477,ubereats,1058959277,2022-11-14 01:39:47,Terrible customer service wait,my friend is always raving about this delivery app so i wanted to give it a try and i also had a 25 dollar off coupon and free delivery so i thought why not,3
732,4479,ubereats,1058959277,2022-11-14 01:39:47,Terrible customer service wait,i put in the right address but took the driver to a completely different placewas on the phone with the driver trying to look for him but he could not do anything about the order,3
732,4480,ubereats,1058959277,2022-11-14 01:39:47,Terrible customer service wait,he had to cancel and i wanted to get a refund but customer service wait was long and the wait time kept getting bigger and higher,3
733,4481,ubereats,1058959277,2022-11-01 20:07:30,Basically a scam,so i understand that the convenience of ordering online and delivery can sometimes be more expensive,1
733,4482,ubereats,1058959277,2022-11-01 20:07:30,Basically a scam,i had found a deal for a restaurant that allowed free delivery if i spent x amount delivery at that location would be freewell low and behold when i go to check out there is a 20 fee attached to my order my bill doubled because there was a lack of drivers,1
733,4483,ubereats,1058959277,2022-11-01 20:07:30,Basically a scam,i get that when there is a shortage of drivers you have to find some way to pull them in but tagging a 20 fee onto a 20 order is absolutely absurd,1
733,4484,ubereats,1058959277,2022-11-01 20:07:30,Basically a scam,i will not be using uber eats again because any company that is thinks it is appropriate to do that to their customers is not worth giving my money to,1
734,4485,ubereats,1058959277,2022-12-20 10:52:58,Terrible app and customer service,during my last order the app did not work,1
734,4486,ubereats,1058959277,2022-12-20 10:52:58,Terrible app and customer service,i was not contacted either by the app nor by phone nor the delivery guy dared to ring the doorbell,1
734,4487,ubereats,1058959277,2022-12-20 10:52:58,Terrible app and customer service,he left with my order and i was charged 64 euros,1
734,4488,ubereats,1058959277,2022-12-20 10:52:58,Terrible app and customer service,i contacted the customer service which refused to refund me because they say the driver contacted me and waited 8 mn,1
734,4489,ubereats,1058959277,2022-12-20 10:52:58,Terrible app and customer service,which is false i dis not receive any phone call and he did not ring the doorbell this a house,1
734,4490,ubereats,1058959277,2022-12-20 10:52:58,Terrible app and customer service,he just left with order and uber eats think it is right to charge me not even leaving the food at the door,1
734,4491,ubereats,1058959277,2022-12-20 10:52:58,Terrible app and customer service,this is an absolute scam,1
734,4492,ubereats,1058959277,2022-12-20 10:52:58,Terrible app and customer service,the wrong practices of this company are frightening i will never order again on this app,1
734,4493,ubereats,1058959277,2022-12-20 10:52:58,Terrible app and customer service,the restaurant i contacted told me it happens all the time,1
735,4494,ubereats,1058959277,2022-12-10 16:56:09,Pathetic,if your tip isnt 10 or more the employees wont pick up your food,1
735,4495,ubereats,1058959277,2022-12-10 16:56:09,Pathetic,i waited almost two hours for food to be delivered that they just canceled after an hour and 45 minutes someone finally picked it up was going back and forth with rohit d one of your employees and left the conversation at ok i will let you know if the food that is been sitting there ready for 45 minutes is any good it is bread so i am gonna assume not,1
735,4496,ubereats,1058959277,2022-12-10 16:56:09,Pathetic,i told them if the food was bad they would hear back from me but if it was fine thanks i appreciate it,1

741,4534,ubereats,1058959277,2022-09-16 03:17:31,DoorDash is infinitely better,probably because i am paying with gift card credits rather than me credit card,1
741,4535,ubereats,1058959277,2022-09-16 03:17:31,DoorDash is infinitely better,does this matter to doordash,1
741,4537,ubereats,1058959277,2022-09-16 03:17:31,DoorDash is infinitely better,when an issue happens uber hates you talking to humans because it costs them money,1
741,4538,ubereats,1058959277,2022-09-16 03:17:31,DoorDash is infinitely better,so what do they do,1
741,4539,ubereats,1058959277,2022-09-16 03:17:31,DoorDash is infinitely better,they make it literally impossible to talk to someone unless there is an emergency or a safety issue,1

741,4542,ubereats,1058959277,2022-09-16 03:17:31,DoorDash is infinitely better,on top of that they definitely have higher prices and charge more fees than doordash,1
741,4543,ubereats,1058959277,2022-09-16 03:17:31,DoorDash is infinitely better,once my credits are all used i am done using these guys,1
742,4544,ubereats,1058959277,2022-09-13 13:25:04,Drivers stealing food,if you held your drivers accountable for food missing from orders you might have less of it,1
742,4545,ubereats,1058959277,2022-09-13 13:25:04,Drivers stealing food,they know the company will refund you so this allows them to continue to do this,1
742,4546,ubereats,1058959277,2022-09-13 13:25:04,Drivers stealing food,stop putting the tips firstit should not prompt you to tip until after your food is delivered,1
742,4547,ubereats,1058959277,2022-09-13 13:25:04,Drivers stealing food,i know you can change it later but that does not always go well,1
742,4548,ubereats,1058959277,2022-09-13 13:25:04,Drivers stealing food,it took me a couple hours to find out that the driver took my food and by then it was too late to change the tip,1
742,4549,ubereats,1058959277,2022-09-13 13:25:04,Drivers stealing food,i encourage anyone who has an issues with their order to start returning all the food and get a full refund tip included and see if that makes uber eats adjust how they do business,1
743,4552,ubereats,1058959277,2022-09-20 18:48:25,Why Uber Eats? Why not Uber Eats?,we have been ordering for a number of years now and have always found the service quick reliable the food delivered hot and fresh by very friendly delivery people,5
743,4553,ubereats,1058959277,2022-09-20 18:48:25,Why Uber Eats? Why not Uber Eats?,yes there are surcharges but that is to be expected for a superior service,5
743,4554,ubereats,1058959277,2022-09-20 18:48:25,Why Uber Eats? Why not Uber Eats?,and these charges are not any much more than you pay for a tip and tax when dining out so it all balances,5
743,4555,ubereats,1058959277,2022-09-20 18:48:25,Why Uber Eats? Why not Uber Eats?,we recommend uber eats for anybody especially families,5

744,4557,ubereats,1058959277,2022-12-01 22:38:06,Discounts and fees,discounts usually do not mean much since fees eat up the discount gas is no longer crazy high so why are we stuck paying these extra fees they do not go to the drivers and the fees are higher when i order more food so it makes me want to order less it does not cost a driver more to bring me a bag with 5 items than it does a bag with 4 items but you charge more because i purchased more food you are hurting consumers drivers and restaurants please stop being greedy,4
745,4558,ubereats,1058959277,2022-11-10 20:03:46,Safety Concerns Not Resolved Only Added to Unsafe Situation,i have had several safety concerns with ubereats drivers,1
745,4559,ubereats,1058959277,2022-11-10 20:03:46,Safety Concerns Not Resolved Only Added to Unsafe Situation,i have reached out to ubereats countless times and the only adviceresolution they offered was for me to contact the driver directly with my concerns which seems like unsafe protocolsuggestions for customers who have the specific issue with the drivers behavior,1
745,4560,ubereats,1058959277,2022-11-10 20:03:46,Safety Concerns Not Resolved Only Added to Unsafe Situation,but after digging a little further into safety concerns just saw how an uber driver broke into a passengers house after he dropped her off and uber did not fire him until after it went viral on tiktok,1

748,4580,ubereats,1058959277,2022-10-17 18:49:19,90%,instead we are told to contact them directly,4

749,4589,ubereats,1058959277,2022-11-29 18:51:52,"Horrible customer service, forced payments",so i am forced to pay indefinitely,1
749,4590,ubereats,1058959277,2022-11-29 18:51:52,"Horrible customer service, forced payments",and their customer service is garbage,1

750,4595,ubereats,1058959277,2022-10-13 05:16:17,🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥,absolutely clutch for multiple reasons the service is immaculate and simply put it is a very convenient app to have features and discounts can be very amazing only complaint would be the premium which i had before but did not really make a difference although it would say it made a difference in terms of discounts on delivery fees and things of that nature,5
750,4596,ubereats,1058959277,2022-10-13 05:16:17,🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥,other than than i highly recommend this app,5
751,4597,ubereats,1058959277,2022-09-21 15:53:47,Could be Better,delivery drivers are usually very nice and mostly faster than the time frame listed,3
751,4598,ubereats,1058959277,2022-09-21 15:53:47,Could be Better,the company itself can improve upon making sure the orders are correct before leaving the stores and restaurants,3
751,4599,ubereats,1058959277,2022-09-21 15:53:47,Could be Better,almost 50 of my orders had something missing that either the driver forgot to check for or the store did not have the proper order complete,3
751,4600,ubereats,1058959277,2022-09-21 15:53:47,Could be Better,not the drivers fault at all as they seem to be excellent just looks bad on the company to have to give refunds for things that could be solved by just double checking the orders,3
752,4601,ubereats,1058959277,2022-11-06 22:19:45,Omfggggggg,i freaking love uber eats i love getting my food it comes fast i eat it i love it and then i do it again and repeat and repeat if you are not using uber eats you are crazy what is wrong with your freaking head come on you can just get on your phone hit a couple buttons wala there is a chicken sandwich baby baby baby baby yeah baby baby i love it love it now uber eats for life till i die i love uber and then i can get a ride come on it does not get any better than that,5

755,4619,ubereats,1058959277,2022-10-10 05:15:38,Confusing logos,i can deduce the last is limited drivers in area based on pricing but how is about adding to the help section what the logos in the app mean,3
755,4620,ubereats,1058959277,2022-10-10 05:15:38,Confusing logos,that would be super useful,3
755,4621,ubereats,1058959277,2022-10-10 05:15:38,Confusing logos,i will be honest seeing confusing logos with no meaning context attached to them irritates me to no end actually kinda pisses me off,3
755,4622,ubereats,1058959277,2022-10-10 05:15:38,Confusing logos,as a software developer myself i do not appreciate when developers do things to make themselves look clever,3
755,4623,ubereats,1058959277,2022-10-10 05:15:38,Confusing logos,it is about the users not how clever you are,3
755,4624,ubereats,1058959277,2022-10-10 05:15:38,Confusing logos,sorry rant over,3

757,4637,ubereats,1058959277,2022-12-17 15:45:15,Nice app,nice app they have your favorite restaurants the only problem for me tho is that your delivery person should focus on one order not have multiple orders from lots of people like i am still waiting on my delivery and i have an appointment at 11am and it is 1043am and i am waiting on my meal but the delivery person is delivering someone elses food you should change that and make them do just one delivery once done they do another one pls,5
758,4638,ubereats,1058959277,2022-10-20 01:21:45,"So far, so good",i have been using uber eats for awhile now and i recently upgraded to their premium service i forget what they call it where i pay a fee up front and my delivery fees are waived,5

761,4663,ubereats,1058959277,2022-11-09 03:26:20,Abuse of Notifications,while notifications are needed for updates about actual food orders this app uses your permission to enable those notifications to also constantly advertise and solicit when the app is not in use,1
761,4664,ubereats,1058959277,2022-11-09 03:26:20,Abuse of Notifications,highly inappropriate,1
761,4665,ubereats,1058959277,2022-11-09 03:26:20,Abuse of Notifications,update attempting to use the app without notifications means you also will not receive any notice when uber eats randomly cancels an already confirmed order after the fact,1
761,4666,ubereats,1058959277,2022-11-09 03:26:20,Abuse of Notifications,so it is really a loselose situation for you,1
761,4667,ubereats,1058959277,2022-11-09 03:26:20,Abuse of Notifications,why would i ever want to support a company that so clearly assumes all of its customers are either too stupid to realize or too distracted to care that they are blatantly being taken advantage of,1

762,4669,ubereats,1058959277,2022-10-30 15:40:55,Terrible app and customer service,i made an order at about 200 am which i was told would take 30 mins,1
762,4670,ubereats,1058959277,2022-10-30 15:40:55,Terrible app and customer service,when i finally paid and ordered it told me 310 the latest which i was not happy about but decided to wait,1
762,4671,ubereats,1058959277,2022-10-30 15:40:55,Terrible app and customer service,at 300 am the app told me the food would be arriving at 350 which was over an hour after the original delivery time,1
762,4672,ubereats,1058959277,2022-10-30 15:40:55,Terrible app and customer service,i decided to cancel because i needed to sleep and was charged almost the full price of the meal,1
762,4673,ubereats,1058959277,2022-10-30 15:40:55,Terrible app and customer service,absolutely ridiculous and an embarrassment to this company,1

763,4676,ubereats,1058959277,2022-09-23 00:46:59,Don't hate it but,the ability to take on more then one delivery needs to be removed food ends up soggy or cold every delivery should be a priority not a pay for option,3
763,4677,ubereats,1058959277,2022-09-23 00:46:59,Don't hate it but,would like a star rating instead of a thumbs up or thumbs down and the ability to type out my own reason for the rating,3
763,4678,ubereats,1058959277,2022-09-23 00:46:59,Don't hate it but,the choices given for rating reason are not always the reason,3
763,4679,ubereats,1058959277,2022-09-23 00:46:59,Don't hate it but,something that prompts the delivery driver to double check the address before drop off would be good too because apparently some drivers cannot bother,3

766,4699,ubereats,1058959277,2022-10-18 19:47:35,Cash grab,sometimes 10 or more on a 25 order,1
766,4700,ubereats,1058959277,2022-10-18 19:47:35,Cash grab,after the tip delivery fee and taxes you are paying double the price for your food than what is advertised,1

766,4704,ubereats,1058959277,2022-10-18 19:47:35,Cash grab,it is only worth ordering if you are stuck without a car or cannot drive,1
767,4705,ubereats,1058959277,2022-10-05 02:55:51,Terrible Sign On,i got a new phone and tried to sign into uber eats,1

773,4746,ubereats,1058959277,2022-11-26 17:33:52,How the mighty have fallen…,i am sure they are losing tons on quality and service issues and it seems the issue is company wide and no one seems to know how to fix it or maybe they just do not want to,1
773,4747,ubereats,1058959277,2022-11-26 17:33:52,How the mighty have fallen…,no drivers use hot bags so it is almost a guarantee that your food will be colder than it would be compared to a competitor,1

773,4752,ubereats,1058959277,2022-11-26 17:33:52,How the mighty have fallen…,maybe uber customer service should take a look at the pretty sharp decline of ubers stock price,1
773,4753,ubereats,1058959277,2022-11-26 17:33:52,How the mighty have fallen…,it is not a coincidence,1

779,4791,ubereats,1058959277,2022-09-15 23:40:15,Won't refund the rotten food delivered,spent an hour texting support and getting no response on hold then tracked down the number to call,1

780,4796,ubereats,1058959277,2022-09-14 01:23:59,Food never was delivered,i find it very frustrating that they still charged me the full amount for the food and the full amount i tipped the driver even though i never received my food,1
780,4797,ubereats,1058959277,2022-09-14 01:23:59,Food never was delivered,i do not appreciate just being out the money for a mistake that was not mine and that i could do nothing about,1
780,4798,ubereats,1058959277,2022-09-14 01:23:59,Food never was delivered,i will be warning everyone i know who uses uber about this and encourage them to use a different service that i know will not charge their customers for items they do not actually receive,1
781,4799,ubereats,1058959277,2022-11-01 20:31:19,Smh,taxes and other fees is the biggest robbery ever,1

781,4802,ubereats,1058959277,2022-11-01 20:31:19,Smh,also instead of sending me 40 discounts every week on places i have never eaten and never will what would it hurt to give me that same 40 off the few i actually order from,1
781,4803,ubereats,1058959277,2022-11-01 20:31:19,Smh,uber one is completely useless,1
781,4804,ubereats,1058959277,2022-11-01 20:31:19,Smh,free delivery on eligible stores but it does not tell you all which storesnot that you have many to pick from i love uber eats delivery times and communication between drivers but everything else outweighs it all,1
782,4805,ubereats,1058959277,2022-10-27 17:58:34,What a scam,one thing i noticed is uber eats charges significantly more compared to doordash,1

782,4808,ubereats,1058959277,2022-10-27 17:58:34,What a scam,instead it added both and made it 15,1
782,4809,ubereats,1058959277,2022-10-27 17:58:34,What a scam,i spoke with support twice and both time they claimed a specialized team must address this and closed the chat on me,1
782,4810,ubereats,1058959277,2022-10-27 17:58:34,What a scam,i then get an email with outdated instructions claiming i can manually change the tip which used to be the case but now it only lets me add,1
782,4811,ubereats,1058959277,2022-10-27 17:58:34,What a scam,i have not received follow up and will only use doordash for now on,1

804,4948,ubereats,1058959277,2022-11-04 23:06:01,Easy to use but unreliable service,or the food comes and it is wrong or half of your coffee is missing spilled dripping out of the bag and customer service tells you it is not their problem that you just paid 25 for a cup of coffee that you did not even get  bad customer service,2
805,4950,ubereats,1058959277,2022-10-15 22:56:55,Done with Uber Eats!!!!,every single time you get a false order delivery estimate time that then inevitably ends up being extended multiple times,1

806,4957,ubereats,1058959277,2022-10-05 17:44:48,Horrible customer service,i use this app often what irritates me is they expect me to pay for items i did not get or pay for items that were wrong if i have proof that items are missing or the order is wrong it should be fixed whether it is sending out the missing items or replacing the items that were wrong are you or giving a refund or a partial refund but that is not how they do it they do not care if you do not get your order they do not care if they make your order wrong so i will not be using uber eats anymore i have doordash i have favor and i think there is another app on my phone,1

812,4994,ubereats,1058959277,2022-10-24 02:11:42,Horrible order process and customer service,first time using this app only because i had a 25 promo to try it out,1

814,5001,ubereats,1058959277,2022-12-10 17:11:41,pretty bad,the app is overpriced and dishonest all the time,2
814,5002,ubereats,1058959277,2022-12-10 17:11:41,pretty bad,i tried ordering something last night had it scheduled for 2hr after the place opens and the thing says it is close then my order is cancelled i close the app and reopen the app and the store is suddenly open but i have to reorder,2
814,5003,ubereats,1058959277,2022-12-10 17:11:41,pretty bad,that just wasted my time alot of it and ordering food from home is supposed to be convenient,2

814,5005,ubereats,1058959277,2022-12-10 17:11:41,pretty bad,use any other food service,2
814,5006,ubereats,1058959277,2022-12-10 17:11:41,pretty bad,the only thing uber can do right is cars,2
815,5007,ubereats,1058959277,2022-11-25 17:23:29,Crashes twice while placing an order,the app closes down while processing an order at least twice  this never used to be the case but lately i noticed how it crashes once you place an order and again when the app begins to process the order,2
815,5008,ubereats,1058959277,2022-11-25 17:23:29,Crashes twice while placing an order,this does not happen on any other food delivery app  i use uber as i get uber credit every month but without that i would place an order elsewhere as it is quite annoying when the app crashes and gives you a black screen for 5 seconds each time,2
816,5009,ubereats,1058959277,2022-12-04 02:15:55,Always an issue with orders,almost every single time i order on my acct or my boyfriends acct there is almost always an error or a mixup or a completely wrong order,1
816,5010,ubereats,1058959277,2022-12-04 02:15:55,Always an issue with orders,and if you complain about your mix ups more than once or twice they will not fix the next messed up order,1

816,5014,ubereats,1058959277,2022-12-04 02:15:55,Always an issue with orders,i hate this app and door dash is much better,1
817,5015,ubereats,1058959277,2022-11-30 22:16:11,Horrible experience with Uber Eats,never received 2 milkshakes they refunded me for one of them but there was no option to explain i ordered 2 even though it was on the receipt,1
817,5016,ubereats,1058959277,2022-11-30 22:16:11,Horrible experience with Uber Eats,every time i tried to report there was another item missing i just kept getting the same message that i would already been refunded the entire amount of the order of 865 lol the order was 65 8 was the amount of the one milkshake so not only did i not get my shakes i still had to pay for them and no one even offered to go get 2 more for me no,1

818,5022,ubereats,1058959277,2022-11-21 15:02:49,Bad food bad delivery food poisoning bad follow up customer service,uber eats would not help with the issue because the few times i have used them i have had problems,1
818,5023,ubereats,1058959277,2022-11-21 15:02:49,Bad food bad delivery food poisoning bad follow up customer service,that is a reflection of uber east not me,1

819,5027,ubereats,1058959277,2022-11-18 21:01:00,can be an unexpectedly bad experience,normally the app is fine it still almost always lies about delivery times,1
819,5028,ubereats,1058959277,2022-11-18 21:01:00,can be an unexpectedly bad experience,but out of my last 50 orders about 5 times the driver does not go to the restaurant,1
819,5029,ubereats,1058959277,2022-11-18 21:01:00,can be an unexpectedly bad experience,just now it happened again,1
819,5030,ubereats,1058959277,2022-11-18 21:01:00,can be an unexpectedly bad experience,i ordered at 8pm and support forced me to wait until 930 before allowing me to cancel,1
819,5031,ubereats,1058959277,2022-11-18 21:01:00,can be an unexpectedly bad experience,it is absolutely silly to not be compensated after being hungry for 15 hours you have basically given them a free loan in exchange for being hungry and a wrench thrown into your schedule,1
819,5032,ubereats,1058959277,2022-11-18 21:01:00,can be an unexpectedly bad experience,i even pay for uber one,1
819,5033,ubereats,1058959277,2022-11-18 21:01:00,can be an unexpectedly bad experience,all the agents are fine but the design of their customer service is pathetic,1
820,5034,ubereats,1058959277,2022-12-07 20:57:43,Did I miss something?,been using grubhub cause uber eats was way expensive a year or two ago,5
820,5035,ubereats,1058959277,2022-12-07 20:57:43,Did I miss something?,now the delivery fee is 4 the base prices seem lower you can pay for 2 faster delivery if you want,5
820,5036,ubereats,1058959277,2022-12-07 20:57:43,Did I miss something?,i might just use it regularly and not have a subscription to a service anymore,5
820,5037,ubereats,1058959277,2022-12-07 20:57:43,Did I miss something?,4 is reasonable and i will not feel obligated to use it more because of the membership,5
821,5038,ubereats,1058959277,2022-12-11 17:43:49,Use another service if you can,no refunds even if an entire entree is left out of the order,1
821,5039,ubereats,1058959277,2022-12-11 17:43:49,Use another service if you can,policies are not in place to make things rightwe ordered a bunch of chinese food for dinner my fiance did not have his meal,1
821,5040,ubereats,1058959277,2022-12-11 17:43:49,Use another service if you can,it took ubereats 2 days to respond and they said the order was not eligible for refund,1
821,5041,ubereats,1058959277,2022-12-11 17:43:49,Use another service if you can,first reason was that the restaurant does not offer refunds then they said it was because we had requested too many refunds in the past  this was our first time ordering we downloaded the app that day,1
821,5042,ubereats,1058959277,2022-12-11 17:43:49,Use another service if you can,they are no longer responding,1
821,5043,ubereats,1058959277,2022-12-11 17:43:49,Use another service if you can,most other companies do what they can to do right by their customers,1
822,5044,ubereats,1058959277,2022-10-12 15:34:31,Issues with app and group orders,i have been ordering group orders since the last two weeks of september and just about everyday i run into a problem,2
822,5045,ubereats,1058959277,2022-10-12 15:34:31,Issues with app and group orders,the biggest issues i have are orders in my cart disappear items are unavailable for next day delivery items are multiplied on the order and lately many restaurants are unavailable even if they are open,2
822,5046,ubereats,1058959277,2022-10-12 15:34:31,Issues with app and group orders,ordering group meals has been frustrating to say the least and when i speak to a support agent i get no real good answer or my order gets screwed up even more,2
823,5047,ubereats,1058959277,2022-09-26 16:32:53,Uber Drivers Cancelling Orders,it makes zero sense to allow a driver to cancel an order just because they cannot complete the delivery,1

827,5071,ubereats,1058959277,2022-10-27 02:51:43,Terrible.,ubereats has absolutely no concern on whether you receive the wrong item are missing an item or an order is brought egregiously late,1
827,5072,ubereats,1058959277,2022-10-27 02:51:43,Terrible.,they have absolutely no accountability for their vendors or drivers who deliver to paying customers that expect what they pay for,1
827,5074,ubereats,1058959277,2022-10-27 02:51:43,Terrible.,then will tell you absurdly that they cannot rectify an incorrect order because it is happened multiple times,1
827,5075,ubereats,1058959277,2022-10-27 02:51:43,Terrible.,who is fault is that,1
827,5076,ubereats,1058959277,2022-10-27 02:51:43,Terrible.,it is not the customer,1

828,5082,ubereats,1058959277,2022-11-28 03:04:39,Multiple stops,my orders are starting to come after the latest time given because the driver has multiple stops between the restaurant and my place,3
828,5083,ubereats,1058959277,2022-11-28 03:04:39,Multiple stops,it takes forever and my food is cold when i get it,3
828,5084,ubereats,1058959277,2022-11-28 03:04:39,Multiple stops,i do not wanna down rate the drivers but there should be a limit so people are getting their food in a timely manner,3
829,5085,ubereats,1058959277,2022-11-06 23:47:38,Way too much trouble,i was submitting my first order and it asked for my id i tried it multiple times and it was saying there was blurryness or a glare when there was none of that at all,1
829,5086,ubereats,1058959277,2022-11-06 23:47:38,Way too much trouble,it would not verify my id after trying over 10 times,1
829,5087,ubereats,1058959277,2022-11-06 23:47:38,Way too much trouble,then i retry and it does it again but when i hit the back button it said we have got your order give the app time for it to show up and it has still yet to show up 10 minutes later,1
829,5088,ubereats,1058959277,2022-11-06 23:47:38,Way too much trouble,i hate this app it takes way to much messing around and needing an id to order food,1

830,5094,ubereats,1058959277,2022-10-14 15:08:39,Wanna no why your orders are taking forever,drivers do not care that you want to tip in cash because we have no guarantee of that,1
830,5095,ubereats,1058959277,2022-10-14 15:08:39,Wanna no why your orders are taking forever,this among many other reason is why we are not in a rush to fill these orders,1

832,5102,ubereats,1058959277,2022-12-10 18:41:05,Expect empty apologies,i have already rated the bakery involved because the entire experience amounted to this is not my problem and the customer service all around was a wild ride of indifference,2
832,5103,ubereats,1058959277,2022-12-10 18:41:05,Expect empty apologies,the only reason i am giving it a two is because the man at ubereats who responded to my call about the 15 cancellation fee was just doing his job  but obviously do not expect any actual help if anything is off,2
833,5104,ubereats,1058959277,2022-12-01 06:50:28,Garbage,very first time using this,1

847,5182,ubereats,1058959277,2022-11-14 19:17:28,Toxic tipping culture,since you came out with that first kinda sketchy app back in 2011ish,1
847,5183,ubereats,1058959277,2022-11-14 19:17:28,Toxic tipping culture,within the past 45 years the user interface has created an entirely toxic tipping culture,1

847,5186,ubereats,1058959277,2022-11-14 19:17:28,Toxic tipping culture,it seems agents find it to be acceptable to not deliver orders when there is a low tip or zero tip applied before it is delivered,1
847,5187,ubereats,1058959277,2022-11-14 19:17:28,Toxic tipping culture,it is wrong to ask a customer to tip before the order is delivered it is almost as if you are suggesting it is required,1

864,5315,ubereats,1058959277,2022-10-07 00:51:56,Absolute Garbage,this app is trash and the developers who built this should feel absolutely ashamed of themselves for building such a piece of crap,1

865,5318,ubereats,1058959277,2022-09-11 01:00:30,Horrible Customer Service,maybe if uber paid their drivers enough we could get decent service and i would not have had to complain,1
865,5319,ubereats,1058959277,2022-09-11 01:00:30,Horrible Customer Service,instead they rip off users and do not provide any decent assistance when you call,1
865,5320,ubereats,1058959277,2022-09-11 01:00:30,Horrible Customer Service,deleting both uber apps since i refuse to give them any more of my money if they cannot provide consistent service,1

866,5324,ubereats,1058959277,2022-12-13 05:33:23,Over charging,and i have checked my past orders but there is nothing with a charge of 21 dollars within that day it was taken from my account,1

866,5326,ubereats,1058959277,2022-12-13 05:33:23,Over charging,no emails no refunds not even uber cash,1
867,5327,ubereats,1058959277,2022-11-22 09:58:33,"Good concept, nobody actually works for them",place an order any time late and night and watch as the app tries and fails to find you a driver,1
867,5328,ubereats,1058959277,2022-11-22 09:58:33,"Good concept, nobody actually works for them",i would have loved for this app to work but unless you like being disappointed stay away,1
867,5329,ubereats,1058959277,2022-11-22 09:58:33,"Good concept, nobody actually works for them",ive had like 3 orders that have been canceled because the app could not find a driver and they make you wait hours until its canceled to give you your money back,1
867,5330,ubereats,1058959277,2022-11-22 09:58:33,"Good concept, nobody actually works for them",i guess thats what happens when you treat your workers like garbage,1
867,5331,ubereats,1058959277,2022-11-22 09:58:33,"Good concept, nobody actually works for them",avoid these resturaunt delivery apps at all cost they are hella not worth the convenience they promise,1
868,5332,ubereats,1058959277,2022-11-16 19:23:56,payment,i would have love to give this application a five star rating however when it came time to pay i would not take my cash app card i seem to run into this problem also with uber rides and all that the payment part is a little complicated and not so userfriendlyi end up having to put the funds into apple paywhich makes no sense because it should be able to take my cash app debit card,3
869,5333,ubereats,1058959277,2022-09-16 18:06:39,Order not received,placed an order at 530 last night with pop up showing an estimated delivery of 610 to 645,1

870,5341,ubereats,1058959277,2022-11-11 16:10:23,"Great Service, Great Drivers",by the way if you can afford to order food on this app then tip the drivers well,5
870,5342,ubereats,1058959277,2022-11-11 16:10:23,"Great Service, Great Drivers",do not be a cheap a if things are so tight there you cannot tip the person doing you a convenience then you should go get it yourself,5
871,5344,ubereats,1058959277,2022-12-09 19:05:40,Refund? Never,deleting the app after this review but i have been charged for orders 3 times now that were cancelled by the merchant,1
871,5345,ubereats,1058959277,2022-12-09 19:05:40,Refund? Never,customer service never addresses the problem they offer credits for the app or tell you to talk to your bank about it,1
871,5346,ubereats,1058959277,2022-12-09 19:05:40,Refund? Never,even if your order is cancelled by the app or merchant as soon as you place it there is still a 310 day authorization hold on the money that twice now has ended up sticking,1
871,5347,ubereats,1058959277,2022-12-09 19:05:40,Refund? Never,ive had to go through my bank twice now for refunds because uber wouldnt solve the problem overall very bad business,1
872,5348,ubereats,1058959277,2022-11-22 12:57:23,Avoid this app at all costs; they do not care about customers,i wish i could give 0 stars but alas,1
872,5349,ubereats,1058959277,2022-11-22 12:57:23,Avoid this app at all costs; they do not care about customers,our driver left almost 50 of our meal at a restaurant which the restaurant confirmed and uber would not send back the driver or refund the money,1
872,5350,ubereats,1058959277,2022-11-22 12:57:23,Avoid this app at all costs; they do not care about customers,i complained over 48 hours and they refused to do anything,1
872,5351,ubereats,1058959277,2022-11-22 12:57:23,Avoid this app at all costs; they do not care about customers,i also had tipped the driver quite well not knowing half of our meal was missing,1
872,5352,ubereats,1058959277,2022-11-22 12:57:23,Avoid this app at all costs; they do not care about customers,there are many food delivery services please use one that cares about their customers because uber eats does not,1
872,5353,ubereats,1058959277,2022-11-22 12:57:23,Avoid this app at all costs; they do not care about customers,door dash is a much better option as are there customer service reps,1

873,5360,ubereats,1058959277,2022-11-16 18:02:02,Agent ended a conversation with me,i definitely would use a different ordering app because how the agent handled it was unprofessional and rude,1
873,5361,ubereats,1058959277,2022-11-16 18:02:02,Agent ended a conversation with me,it should not take over an hour for a drink that is 12 minutes away,1

874,5365,ubereats,1058959277,2022-11-12 02:10:51,Awful interface that led me to get charged for an order I never received!,i had inadvertently selected 7100 n ih 35 instead of s ih 35,1
874,5366,ubereats,1058959277,2022-11-12 02:10:51,Awful interface that led me to get charged for an order I never received!,i did not see the problem until the driver picked up the food,1
874,5367,ubereats,1058959277,2022-11-12 02:10:51,Awful interface that led me to get charged for an order I never received!,then i immediately rushed to correct it,1
874,5368,ubereats,1058959277,2022-11-12 02:10:51,Awful interface that led me to get charged for an order I never received!,but the app canceled my order when i updated the delivery address since my correct address was out of the area,1

875,5371,ubereats,1058959277,2022-11-03 01:29:07,"30 min delivery is a lie, they take 1.5 hours",when your browsing they say delivery in 35 minutes then once you order they say 1 hour but if you read the gray colored fine print they say latest delivery by 15 hours,5
875,5372,ubereats,1058959277,2022-11-03 01:29:07,"30 min delivery is a lie, they take 1.5 hours",so they triple the advertised delivery time and tell you that only after you have already placed the orders,5
875,5373,ubereats,1058959277,2022-11-03 01:29:07,"30 min delivery is a lie, they take 1.5 hours",that is deceitful,5

876,5376,ubereats,1058959277,2022-10-16 23:45:29,Cancelations and missing items,it is so difficult to get a real person to speak to and when you get someone super rare they are no help and they end the conversation when nothing has been resolved,1
876,5377,ubereats,1058959277,2022-10-16 23:45:29,Cancelations and missing items,i am no longer using uber eats and switching back to seamless because everything is early never have missing items and the support team is great,1

923,5613,ubereats,1058959277,2022-12-15 00:44:00,This app really took a nosedive in service,paying uber one member and lately the delivery experience has been horrible,1
923,5614,ubereats,1058959277,2022-12-15 00:44:00,This app really took a nosedive in service,always delays and somehow drivers end up on the complete opposite side of town with my order after picking it up,1
923,5615,ubereats,1058959277,2022-12-15 00:44:00,This app really took a nosedive in service,how is that a stop along the way,1

923,5618,ubereats,1058959277,2022-12-15 00:44:00,This app really took a nosedive in service,driver picked up food finally and they added another stop delaying it even more,1
923,5619,ubereats,1058959277,2022-12-15 00:44:00,This app really took a nosedive in service,if your customers order was already delayed it is totally unacceptable to be adding stops,1
924,5620,ubereats,1058959277,2022-12-02 04:44:54,Food stollen and no assistance from support,i did my first ever order today and the food was delivered to a whole foods instead of my apartment,1
924,5621,ubereats,1058959277,2022-12-02 04:44:54,Food stollen and no assistance from support,the driver called and requested my pin,1
924,5622,ubereats,1058959277,2022-12-02 04:44:54,Food stollen and no assistance from support,without knowing that would allow her to claim the food was delivered it was provided,1
924,5623,ubereats,1058959277,2022-12-02 04:44:54,Food stollen and no assistance from support,i received a notification the food was delivered yet i never saw it,1

924,5625,ubereats,1058959277,2022-12-02 04:44:54,Food stollen and no assistance from support,do not order from this company,1
924,5626,ubereats,1058959277,2022-12-02 04:44:54,Food stollen and no assistance from support,they will not support you if something goes wrong and will wrongfully take your money,1
925,5627,ubereats,1058959277,2022-11-27 19:00:08,DoorDash is better,the only reason why i am saying doordash is better is because it does not scam you,3
925,5628,ubereats,1058959277,2022-11-27 19:00:08,DoorDash is better,for example when i decide to order food and i explore but nothing interests me i leave the app and go on with my day,3
925,5629,ubereats,1058959277,2022-11-27 19:00:08,DoorDash is better,2 minutes later i get a 10 off promotion so i open it,3
925,5630,ubereats,1058959277,2022-11-27 19:00:08,DoorDash is better,and guess what the promotion failed,3
925,5631,ubereats,1058959277,2022-11-27 19:00:08,DoorDash is better,this has not happened one time but multiple,3
925,5632,ubereats,1058959277,2022-11-27 19:00:08,DoorDash is better,so at least doordash does not scam you to open their app,3
926,5633,ubereats,1058959277,2022-10-10 01:34:23,Blaze,our last experience much better then tonights,3
926,5634,ubereats,1058959277,2022-10-10 01:34:23,Blaze,when i did not see a choice for extra cheese  we like ours very cheesy i checked shredded and fresh mozzarella,3
926,5635,ubereats,1058959277,2022-10-10 01:34:23,Blaze,both box labels indicated our choices but unfortunately there was only several discs of fresh on the pies and lots of area with just sauce,3
926,5636,ubereats,1058959277,2022-10-10 01:34:23,Blaze,since it is most likely just a mistake and our order several weeks ago was perfect we may try them again,3
927,5637,ubereats,1058959277,2022-10-07 14:30:36,Do not use if you own a liquor store,we received an increase in daily ubereats orders,1
927,5638,ubereats,1058959277,2022-10-07 14:30:36,Do not use if you own a liquor store,we contacted ubereats to confirm they were verifying these transactions before we fulfilled them,1
927,5639,ubereats,1058959277,2022-10-07 14:30:36,Do not use if you own a liquor store,ue said yes orders are verified these are ue customers and to please fulfill orders,1
927,5640,ubereats,1058959277,2022-10-07 14:30:36,Do not use if you own a liquor store,we do not have access to customer info to double check so we fulfilled ordersthe driver upon delivery is supposed to verify customer name and age before hand off,1
927,5641,ubereats,1058959277,2022-10-07 14:30:36,Do not use if you own a liquor store,if there is a discrepancy the item is supposed to be returned to the store at the customers expensewe eventually process 3500 in orders of high end items,1
927,5642,ubereats,1058959277,2022-10-07 14:30:36,Do not use if you own a liquor store,uber subsequently contacts us days later to inform us our account is closed and we will not be receiving payments due to fraudi tried to dispute it and got locked in a spiral of automated email responses and customer service reps that direct you to the email which generates an automatic denial responseuser beware,1

972,5901,ubereats,1058959277,2022-09-29 04:04:15,Poor customer service,for a company as big as this there should be a support number for customers they can call for any issues and actually be able to speak to a human on the other end to help resolve issues,1

982,5953,ubereats,1058959277,2022-09-13 03:01:01,Perfect customer service,will be returning to the app again sometime soon,5
983,5954,ubereats,1058959277,2022-09-18 23:49:05,Uber has gone way down hill,this app has become so unreliable when it comes to restaurants either not delivering food at all or canceling after waiting 30 minutes or just arriving way after initially promised or placing the order,1
983,5955,ubereats,1058959277,2022-09-18 23:49:05,Uber has gone way down hill,paying for priority on many occasions feels like it is a total scam and they can tell you that the order will be later without giving any restitution customer service is absolutely useless and condescending,1
983,5956,ubereats,1058959277,2022-09-18 23:49:05,Uber has gone way down hill,it is sad to see such a good company have gone so far downhill,1
984,5957,ubereats,1058959277,2022-09-16 19:08:28,Nope!,they allowed me to purchase there subscription service uber one without verifying my cvv which is fine because i lose my cards all the time,1
984,5958,ubereats,1058959277,2022-09-16 19:08:28,Nope!,the funny thing is right after that they would not allow me to purchase food without verification,1
984,5959,ubereats,1058959277,2022-09-16 19:08:28,Nope!,so i was able to set myself up for a monthly fee which i was entice to do becausei was going to save on the order i was currently making then i was not allowed to make that order,1
984,5960,ubereats,1058959277,2022-09-16 19:08:28,Nope!,also it just does not have nearly as many options as doordash,1
985,5962,ubereats,1058959277,2022-11-23 14:36:02,Paying for priority is pointless,i love using uber eats,4
985,5963,ubereats,1058959277,2022-11-23 14:36:02,Paying for priority is pointless,especially when i cannot get out or just do not want to cook,4
985,5964,ubereats,1058959277,2022-11-23 14:36:02,Paying for priority is pointless,the only problem i have had is i have paid the extra fee for priority to be delivered straight to me and still waited past the wait time a lot of the time i waited past the wait time,4
985,5965,ubereats,1058959277,2022-11-23 14:36:02,Paying for priority is pointless,so paying for priority is pointless to me,4
986,5966,ubereats,1058959277,2022-12-02 01:13:58,Allow more saved addresses,why is it only 4 addresses,3
986,5967,ubereats,1058959277,2022-12-02 01:13:58,Allow more saved addresses,it makes no sense,3
986,5968,ubereats,1058959277,2022-12-02 01:13:58,Allow more saved addresses,i work in more than 3 different places and i often visit my family so i need to add more addresses,3
986,5969,ubereats,1058959277,2022-12-02 01:13:58,Allow more saved addresses,also you should allow the user to save as 2 diff addresses eg,3
986,5970,ubereats,1058959277,2022-12-02 01:13:58,Allow more saved addresses,one for day delivery and another one for evening delivery because the access doors can vary even if it is the same building,3
986,5971,ubereats,1058959277,2022-12-02 01:13:58,Allow more saved addresses,it is amazing you have not contemplated this basic need yet,3
987,5972,ubereats,1058959277,2022-11-30 21:00:37,This app should be called Uber Thieves,i honestly do not understand how is it that i do not receive my food and you still charge me the money that i spent for the food that i should have received and then not give me my refund,1
987,5973,ubereats,1058959277,2022-11-30 21:00:37,This app should be called Uber Thieves,your policy is absurd and the fact that you stole my money it is upsetting,1
987,5974,ubereats,1058959277,2022-11-30 21:00:37,This app should be called Uber Thieves,i used to order from this app and i even did the deliveries myself,1
987,5975,ubereats,1058959277,2022-11-30 21:00:37,This app should be called Uber Thieves,now that you showed your true face i will no longer use your service nor will i work with a bunch of thieves,1
987,5976,ubereats,1058959277,2022-11-30 21:00:37,This app should be called Uber Thieves,if i could i would give you guys 20 stars,1
988,5977,ubereats,1058959277,2022-11-21 16:26:36,Fraud,spent two hours disputing an increase from an original estimate of 30  to a final delivery of 100  with 3 substitutions,1
988,5978,ubereats,1058959277,2022-11-21 16:26:36,Fraud,one of the items substituted was feta with a sticker price of 8 dollars which appeared to become an 18 dollar item  even though item does not come up when you search for it  and non of the items cost as much in uber after talking for 2 hours with support and them telling me  that they can charge what ever they want and not provide an itemized receipt that would show how the coast of my order increased by 70,1
988,5979,ubereats,1058959277,2022-11-21 16:26:36,Fraud,not responding uber one employee shivan gupta started to teach me about fairness,1
988,5980,ubereats,1058959277,2022-11-21 16:26:36,Fraud,and in the end completely ignored my questions and stopped responding at all,1
988,5981,ubereats,1058959277,2022-11-21 16:26:36,Fraud,so it was my final experience with the platform and how lovely was it especially after paying a 10 fee for such a privilege,1
988,5982,ubereats,1058959277,2022-11-21 16:26:36,Fraud,great experience,1
989,5983,ubereats,1058959277,2022-10-01 05:17:34,you can always count on cherries for late night food,when i am starving and cannot find anything open it is always sherrys,5

990,5988,ubereats,1058959277,2022-11-13 22:29:05,Worst Food delivery app there is,well if you had like all of the above download this app and watch your 10 dollar order turn into a 21 dollar order,1
990,5989,ubereats,1058959277,2022-11-13 22:29:05,Worst Food delivery app there is,get doordash or grubhub because this app is a true money grab,1
990,5990,ubereats,1058959277,2022-11-13 22:29:05,Worst Food delivery app there is,currently waiting on my food that is been on the move for an hour,1

991,5996,ubereats,1058959277,2022-11-05 16:23:22,Uber Eats Took My Money,shortly after my order was cancelled and uber said they were going to give me a refund,1
991,5997,ubereats,1058959277,2022-11-05 16:23:22,Uber Eats Took My Money,i waited and the refund never came,1
991,5998,ubereats,1058959277,2022-11-05 16:23:22,Uber Eats Took My Money,i called uber and they said because it is been 48 hours they could not issue a refund,1

992,6003,ubereats,1058959277,2022-10-14 14:12:56,Cold Food Every Time,there should be a test for every uber driver to make sure they know how to drive in the city,1
992,6004,ubereats,1058959277,2022-10-14 14:12:56,Cold Food Every Time,these people and i do not mean the drivers only app makers as well do not know how to navigate the city,1
992,6005,ubereats,1058959277,2022-10-14 14:12:56,Cold Food Every Time,i will watch my delivery and they will take side streets instead of the freeway,1
992,6006,ubereats,1058959277,2022-10-14 14:12:56,Cold Food Every Time,a 15 minute drive will take them 35 minutes cause the drivers follow the stupid navigation app given to them instead of driving the fastest route,1
993,6008,ubereats,1058959277,2022-10-04 17:36:06,The order is always messed up,i have had it for two months after years of using doordash,1

993,6011,ubereats,1058959277,2022-10-04 17:36:06,The order is always messed up,uber eats does not care at all,1
993,6012,ubereats,1058959277,2022-10-04 17:36:06,The order is always messed up,when there is an issue with doordash like this they give you a credit or refund your entire order to make up for the inconvenience,1
993,6013,ubereats,1058959277,2022-10-04 17:36:06,The order is always messed up,i highly recommend utilizing any other delivery service besides uber eats,1

995,6019,ubereats,1058959277,2022-09-16 12:22:53,"Very high prices within the app, ""benefits"" are useless",even with uber one i have to spend over 20 to apply the promo and despite that my order is still high because the promo does nothing to reduce the price,2
995,6020,ubereats,1058959277,2022-09-16 12:22:53,"Very high prices within the app, ""benefits"" are useless",i applied for uber one expecting the first month to be free as they advertised yet i was charged 5 on my card after applying,2
995,6021,ubereats,1058959277,2022-09-16 12:22:53,"Very high prices within the app, ""benefits"" are useless",this is useless i am an unsatisfied customer,2
996,6022,ubereats,1058959277,2022-09-15 01:39:47,Good while it lasted…,i used to enjoy this app as a college student but the last food order i had came ice cold and uber did not do anything to fix the problem,2
996,6023,ubereats,1058959277,2022-09-15 01:39:47,Good while it lasted…,the order i currently have was promised by 945 as an uberone member but all of a sudden they changed it to 1015 without keeping their promise of gifting 5 if it came after 945,2
996,6024,ubereats,1058959277,2022-09-15 01:39:47,Good while it lasted…,this has gotten annoying and i cannot afford to spend this amount of money on poor quality serviceplanning,2
997,6025,ubereats,1058959277,2022-10-30 05:40:12,It's a nice service,i drive a truck and cannot get the truck into a lot of places so it is nice having this service but sometimes the food is terrible but that is the restaurants fault i guess,5
997,6026,ubereats,1058959277,2022-10-30 05:40:12,It's a nice service,someone pay off the order is missing but that is probably the restaurant too,5
998,6027,ubereats,1058959277,2022-12-12 20:31:15,Too many promos,use uber eats like every other week but get multiple promo notifications every dayit is really annoying i cannot disable it,2

998,6029,ubereats,1058959277,2022-12-12 20:31:15,Too many promos,gonna give it another week if it continues gonna delete the app and switch to grubhub or something  might be less selection in my area but at least i do not get these annoying notifications all day,2
999,6030,ubereats,1058959277,2022-11-07 16:44:19,Unavailable and Unreliable,i have only ever been able to use this app in bigger cities and 810 times the driver will steal one of the items from my order or the restaurant will get it wrong even though i directly put what i wanted in said orderthe app sends constant unnecessary notifications most about how they added more new locations however for 4 years they have not and will not deliver to my home location,2
1000,6031,ubereats,1058959277,2022-11-01 20:46:16,Worst service ever,it is the worst customer service i have ever seen,1
1000,6032,ubereats,1058959277,2022-11-01 20:46:16,Worst service ever,i have to wait for my order for more than 2 hours from a restaurant that is 20 min away and unfortunately i was having avery hungry kids with me to be surprised after that with a wrong messy order and we have nothing to eat then when i contact customer service instead of apologizing there is no response even i had a promotion with 25 they have not refund it back,1
1000,6033,ubereats,1058959277,2022-11-01 20:46:16,Worst service ever,it was my first and last time to use this miserable application,1

1001,6036,ubereats,1058959277,2022-10-20 03:41:52,App bug,the map looks weird because it puts the black line in a different street even when i put in my correct address,5
1002,6037,ubereats,1058959277,2022-10-17 23:51:09,Pretty good,overall it has most of all the restaurants i like on the app and rewards are always good,5
1002,6038,ubereats,1058959277,2022-10-17 23:51:09,Pretty good,has a wide variety of different places to eat from and again always has offers,5
1002,6039,ubereats,1058959277,2022-10-17 23:51:09,Pretty good,it is just the taxes when you got to checkout that is the only issue lol,5
1003,6040,ubereats,1058959277,2022-10-13 16:52:45,What's going on?,virtuallyevery restaurant i go to in the app it allows me to choose items and when i go to my cart i get a message that says sorry your menu options have changed while ordering or something like that but regardless i am not able to complete the order,2
1003,6041,ubereats,1058959277,2022-10-13 16:52:45,What's going on?,literally six different restaurants almost all of which i have ordered from previously showed me this message and it is been happening for several weeks,2
1004,6042,ubereats,1058959277,2022-10-12 18:38:55,Goodbye Uber Eats,i have used uber eats for many years and now i am at my wits end,1
1004,6043,ubereats,1058959277,2022-10-12 18:38:55,Goodbye Uber Eats,i am being charged a service fee higher than even the taxes,1
1004,6044,ubereats,1058959277,2022-10-12 18:38:55,Goodbye Uber Eats,and when i place orders my food ends up arriving cold because it takes so long to find a driver,1
1004,6045,ubereats,1058959277,2022-10-12 18:38:55,Goodbye Uber Eats,the app ends up saying things like oops looks like we will need to find a new driver which is ridiculous because by the time they find one i could have gone and picked my food up myself and have already ate it,1
1004,6046,ubereats,1058959277,2022-10-12 18:38:55,Goodbye Uber Eats,i will no longer be using uber eats time to switch to door dash,1
1005,6047,postmates,512393983,2022-12-03 02:22:04,Usually great,i use postmates at least once a week on average and subscribe and always tip drivers 20 plus and usually add cash too just cause i know how hard this world is,4
1005,6048,postmates,512393983,2022-12-03 02:22:04,Usually great,but im still very upset that about a month ago i ordered a pizza when i was out of town  i have my location setting set to while using app because i do not see the purpose of a delivery app knowing my exact location every minute of every day when i got home late and exhausted from traveling i ordered supper and it was sent to a popular chain but in my previous location i immediately received a notification that i was far from the delivery address and i canceled the order  but was still billed then reordered the exact same order from correct location and it was also canceled,4
1005,6049,postmates,512393983,2022-12-03 02:22:04,Usually great,both show canceled on my account but i was still charged for the first accidental order and had to cook supper at 89pm after traveling all day,4
1005,6050,postmates,512393983,2022-12-03 02:22:04,Usually great,so not happy about that,4
1005,6051,postmates,512393983,2022-12-03 02:22:04,Usually great,i feel like im a fair customer and try my best to be honest and fair to my clients this is something that i am very unhappy about having to pay an extra almost 83 this month on my credit card for a order that was canceled within minutes of placing the order,4
1006,6052,postmates,512393983,2022-12-05 14:21:22,"Support is horrendous, stick to other companies",tried using postmates for the first time and after searchingselecting and then submitting an order it kicked back saying no drivers available,1
1006,6053,postmates,512393983,2022-12-05 14:21:22,"Support is horrendous, stick to other companies",i think okay fine i will see if other closer restaurants will work i find a local restaurant and place the order,1
1006,6054,postmates,512393983,2022-12-05 14:21:22,"Support is horrendous, stick to other companies",it arrives in a semireasonable time frame,1

1006,6056,postmates,512393983,2022-12-05 14:21:22,"Support is horrendous, stick to other companies",i contact help who are absolutely beyond useless,1
1006,6057,postmates,512393983,2022-12-05 14:21:22,"Support is horrendous, stick to other companies",they just provide canned answers stating this order is not eligible for any refund or adjustment but we will use this info to better our service in the future,1
1006,6058,postmates,512393983,2022-12-05 14:21:22,"Support is horrendous, stick to other companies",i am sorry what,1
1006,6059,postmates,512393983,2022-12-05 14:21:22,"Support is horrendous, stick to other companies",i have used other services doordash etc who immediately rectify and take accountability for issues using their service,1
1006,6060,postmates,512393983,2022-12-05 14:21:22,"Support is horrendous, stick to other companies",i even escalated it to a supervisor who literally just copypasted the same answer with no help,1

1056,6378,postmates,512393983,2022-10-22 00:55:04,Unlimited is a SCAM,the restaurants charge your more for the same items if you have unlimited for example adding rice cost me with unlimited 350 and my husband without unlimited 250 overall my cart total would always be higher taxes would be higher and i would overpay on top of paying them monthly complete scam and ripoff,1
1057,6379,postmates,512393983,2022-10-21 03:33:48,Terrible customer service,postmate and uber is jsut a terrible app and company in general,1
1057,6381,postmates,512393983,2022-10-21 03:33:48,Terrible customer service,they will change your delivery time after you place your order for example you will see the delivery time to be 20min and when you go check your delivery status 20 minutes later they will say that the estimated delivery time changed to 40 minutes,1
1057,6383,postmates,512393983,2022-10-21 03:33:48,Terrible customer service,their customer service is terrible and never answers your issue,1
1057,6384,postmates,512393983,2022-10-21 03:33:48,Terrible customer service,they will end the chat before solving the problem,1
1058,6385,postmates,512393983,2022-12-20 02:37:59,convenience.. but at what cost?,same old complaints exorbitant delivery fees inability to make customizations or add sauces etc impossible to get orders fixed right then when there are errors you can only get a refund or order the whole thing again,2
1058,6386,postmates,512393983,2022-12-20 02:37:59,convenience.. but at what cost?,too impersonal and hard to get ahold of anyone that does take accountability,2
1058,6387,postmates,512393983,2022-12-20 02:37:59,convenience.. but at what cost?,but i keep coming back for the convenience and at least they tend to be quick with refunds,2
1059,6389,postmates,512393983,2022-11-17 01:43:52,Payment glitchy,it was hard to add what payment i wanted onto my order,4
1059,6390,postmates,512393983,2022-11-17 01:43:52,Payment glitchy,maybe if there was a done button on the payment page it would have made more sense than going back and forth,4
1059,6391,postmates,512393983,2022-11-17 01:43:52,Payment glitchy,also there needs to be a way to edit or delete a payment,4

1060,6393,postmates,512393983,2022-10-16 22:09:48,No accountability,that is on the vendor but the app is really limited in their accountability with how they communicate and resolve problems,2
1060,6394,postmates,512393983,2022-10-16 22:09:48,No accountability,you end up calling the vendor and hearing one side and postmates just wants to cancel and refund,2
1060,6395,postmates,512393983,2022-10-16 22:09:48,No accountability,what a waste of my and i am sure the drivers time,2

1119,6622,doordash,719972451,2022-11-15 04:41:26,Beware of driver name OTM,but i like their quick response,5
1119,6623,doordash,719972451,2022-11-15 04:41:26,Beware of driver name OTM,our door also has light and cameras,5
1119,6624,doordash,719972451,2022-11-15 04:41:26,Beware of driver name OTM,unfortunately the next driver placed the bag of food so close to the door that i could not open it without it rolling down the steps and she seen me the passenger struggle and still drove off,5
1119,6625,doordash,719972451,2022-11-15 04:41:26,Beware of driver name OTM,she literally could of got out and helped but i guess she waited for me to say help when i looked up to say help she already was driving away,5
1119,6626,doordash,719972451,2022-11-15 04:41:26,Beware of driver name OTM,tho i would of not waited for someone to say help and offered it i still feel this was a better driver than the otm which i found out means on the move meaning someone making moves being sneaky and they sure was and got away with it,5
1119,6627,doordash,719972451,2022-11-15 04:41:26,Beware of driver name OTM,other than those two experiences i am ok with giving the app another try,5
1119,6628,doordash,719972451,2022-11-15 04:41:26,Beware of driver name OTM,i am in philly pa so people out here going to try to take advantage the best way they know how and think they entitled to it smh i just wish there was a way to protect us from people like this who they hire,5
1119,6629,doordash,719972451,2022-11-15 04:41:26,Beware of driver name OTM,i am ordering again today so let us see what happens now,5
1120,6630,doordash,719972451,2022-12-10 00:11:50,Only use as last resort,i have been using doordash for a while now and it is only getting worse,2
1120,6631,doordash,719972451,2022-12-10 00:11:50,Only use as last resort,not only is the food a lot more expensive using the app but the drivers never follow the instructions at all,2
1120,6632,doordash,719972451,2022-12-10 00:11:50,Only use as last resort,i have specific instructions for both home and office and in neither location do they ever read the instructions,2
1120,6633,doordash,719972451,2022-12-10 00:11:50,Only use as last resort,on top of that half of the drivers cannot speak or read english so it does not matter if i write instructions on where to leave the food,2
1120,6634,doordash,719972451,2022-12-10 00:11:50,Only use as last resort,the last time i ordered food it was for my office and it explicitly stated to walk inside the building and hand it to me or put it on the front desk,2
1120,6635,doordash,719972451,2022-12-10 00:11:50,Only use as last resort,instead the driver went to the totally wrong door and left the food outside in the cold and rain,2
1120,6636,doordash,719972451,2022-12-10 00:11:50,Only use as last resort,on top of that there is no way to adjust the tip or to conveniently take away the tip when they failed to do their job appropriately,2
1120,6637,doordash,719972451,2022-12-10 00:11:50,Only use as last resort,i am sorry but i do not feel i should have to tip a person for not doing an appropriate job in the first place,2
1120,6638,doordash,719972451,2022-12-10 00:11:50,Only use as last resort,if they cannot do their job they do not deserve tip,2
1120,6639,doordash,719972451,2022-12-10 00:11:50,Only use as last resort,this is coming from a person who worked in the service industry for a very long time,2
1120,6640,doordash,719972451,2022-12-10 00:11:50,Only use as last resort,there was even one time when i ordered my food and the driver brought me the completely wrong order,2
1120,6641,doordash,719972451,2022-12-10 00:11:50,Only use as last resort,since it was later in the evening i was not able to have the food order corrected,2
1120,6642,doordash,719972451,2022-12-10 00:11:50,Only use as last resort,doordash did refund me my money but i was still screwed on food for that night,2
1120,6643,doordash,719972451,2022-12-10 00:11:50,Only use as last resort,it is just not worth it unless you are in a desperate situation,2
1121,6644,doordash,719972451,2022-11-07 04:36:03,Good for consumers bad for dashers.,i have been both a consumer and dasher and it is very convenient for a consumer if you are willing to pay the extra fee but it is also hard to tip so much extra for the dasher to make it worth while,4
1121,6645,doordash,719972451,2022-11-07 04:36:03,Good for consumers bad for dashers.,as a previous dasher i know that it is hard to even call it a side hustle,4
1121,6646,doordash,719972451,2022-11-07 04:36:03,Good for consumers bad for dashers.,most consumers are reluctant to leave a tip and when they do it is minimal but i understand as a consumer that it is hard to pay a big tip when you order something and the price is twice as much as item you paid for just because door dash charges extra,4
1121,6647,doordash,719972451,2022-11-07 04:36:03,Good for consumers bad for dashers.,then you have you tile the driver because trust be they do not make much without a tip,4
1121,6648,doordash,719972451,2022-11-07 04:36:03,Good for consumers bad for dashers.,please tip big for these dashers if they do a good job so there is more value in it,4
1121,6649,doordash,719972451,2022-11-07 04:36:03,Good for consumers bad for dashers.,remember door dah does not pay for gas insurance maintenance or anything,4
1121,6650,doordash,719972451,2022-11-07 04:36:03,Good for consumers bad for dashers.,yes dashers get a tax write off but it is not exactly the same,4
1121,6651,doordash,719972451,2022-11-07 04:36:03,Good for consumers bad for dashers.,also if you are a dasher you may want to try instacart instead if it is popular in your city,4
1121,6652,doordash,719972451,2022-11-07 04:36:03,Good for consumers bad for dashers.,especially in the winter,4
1121,6653,doordash,719972451,2022-11-07 04:36:03,Good for consumers bad for dashers.,it is pays better and it keeps you more active throughout the day,4
1121,6654,doordash,719972451,2022-11-07 04:36:03,Good for consumers bad for dashers.,i made way more doing instacart when i was trying both,4
1121,6655,doordash,719972451,2022-11-07 04:36:03,Good for consumers bad for dashers.,around 20 and hour,4
1121,6656,doordash,719972451,2022-11-07 04:36:03,Good for consumers bad for dashers.,again you are an independent contractor so you can get write offs,4
1121,6657,doordash,719972451,2022-11-07 04:36:03,Good for consumers bad for dashers.,i personally wrote off all of my taxes as a instacarter and make about 40000 a year gross income,4
1122,6658,doordash,719972451,2022-09-24 00:10:33,Customer service is a disaster,i placed an order two drivers bailed out on the order due to having to wait an extra ten minutes,1
1122,6659,doordash,719972451,2022-09-24 00:10:33,Customer service is a disaster,mind you we tip a ridiculous amount both being in the service industry,1
1122,6660,doordash,719972451,2022-09-24 00:10:33,Customer service is a disaster,so someone picks up the order drops it off and runs away,1

1122,6664,doordash,719972451,2022-09-24 00:10:33,Customer service is a disaster,call customer service and told 100 will go back to the card,1

1122,6666,doordash,719972451,2022-09-24 00:10:33,Customer service is a disaster,so i contact them and of course there is nothing they can do,1
1122,6667,doordash,719972451,2022-09-24 00:10:33,Customer service is a disaster,this man i spoke to via text convo told me to calm down said i was too excited and maybe i had personal problems to be upset that i was lied to again,1
1122,6668,doordash,719972451,2022-09-24 00:10:33,Customer service is a disaster,i have loads of screenshots where i was insulted and pretty much called a pos,1
1122,6669,doordash,719972451,2022-09-24 00:10:33,Customer service is a disaster,by someone who refused to apply the credit to my card and not an app credit,1
1122,6670,doordash,719972451,2022-09-24 00:10:33,Customer service is a disaster,i was then promised 30 dollars in a gift card multiple times and got a wait for it 500 credit when asking to speak with someone higher up or idk maybe over the phone i was told i was old and to get with the times,1
1122,6671,doordash,719972451,2022-09-24 00:10:33,Customer service is a disaster,no on talks on the phone anymore,1
1122,6672,doordash,719972451,2022-09-24 00:10:33,Customer service is a disaster,i am sure the bbb would love to know they are lying about their return policy and method of payment,1
1122,6673,doordash,719972451,2022-09-24 00:10:33,Customer service is a disaster,customer service is disgusting and a total waste of time,1
1122,6674,doordash,719972451,2022-09-24 00:10:33,Customer service is a disaster,just do not use the app,1
1122,6675,doordash,719972451,2022-09-24 00:10:33,Customer service is a disaster,just drive to the place,1
1122,6676,doordash,719972451,2022-09-24 00:10:33,Customer service is a disaster,give the money to the restaurant directly,1
1122,6677,doordash,719972451,2022-09-24 00:10:33,Customer service is a disaster,crappy drivers are one thing,1
1122,6678,doordash,719972451,2022-09-24 00:10:33,Customer service is a disaster,bad customer service is a company approved problem,1
1123,6679,doordash,719972451,2022-11-13 12:09:58,Sick of delivery issues,i have used doordash quite frequently over the past two years,2
1123,6680,doordash,719972451,2022-11-13 12:09:58,Sick of delivery issues,however lately it seems i am having more more issues with my food not being delivered to the correct address or dashers picking up other orders and my food getting here extremely late,2
1123,6681,doordash,719972451,2022-11-13 12:09:58,Sick of delivery issues,that has even happened when i have ordered things such as ice cream,2
1123,6682,doordash,719972451,2022-11-13 12:09:58,Sick of delivery issues,i think the worst part about it is that some of these dashers do not respond to your calls or messages,2
1123,6683,doordash,719972451,2022-11-13 12:09:58,Sick of delivery issues,i could easily direct them to my house which is not at all difficult to find,2
1123,6684,doordash,719972451,2022-11-13 12:09:58,Sick of delivery issues,gps takes anyone directly to my driveway which is only 15 feet long,2
1123,6685,doordash,719972451,2022-11-13 12:09:58,Sick of delivery issues,for a long time my orders often came without the drinks,2
1123,6686,doordash,719972451,2022-11-13 12:09:58,Sick of delivery issues,therefore i stopped ordering drinks,2
1123,6687,doordash,719972451,2022-11-13 12:09:58,Sick of delivery issues,but now there seems to be issues more and more,2
1123,6688,doordash,719972451,2022-11-13 12:09:58,Sick of delivery issues,the worst part is often times i only get partial refunds when a delivery does not go well,2
1123,6689,doordash,719972451,2022-11-13 12:09:58,Sick of delivery issues,or when the delivery is delivered to an entirely different place i get offered to have it redelivered,2
1123,6690,doordash,719972451,2022-11-13 12:09:58,Sick of delivery issues,but then the new dasher ended up still picking up somebody elses order before mine and then came to my neighborhood with blaring music that caused some of my neighbors to step outside,2
1123,6691,doordash,719972451,2022-11-13 12:09:58,Sick of delivery issues,very embarrassing,2
1123,6692,doordash,719972451,2022-11-13 12:09:58,Sick of delivery issues,i was afraid to even complain about the loud music as this person obviously knows where i live,2
1123,6693,doordash,719972451,2022-11-13 12:09:58,Sick of delivery issues,all these issues coupled with the high prices make this no longer worth the trouble,2
1123,6694,doordash,719972451,2022-11-13 12:09:58,Sick of delivery issues,therefore i have deleted the app and will no longer be using,2
1124,6695,doordash,719972451,2022-11-17 19:01:32,Incredibly frustrating experience,i have had doordash for a couple of years now but over the past couple of months it has become an incredibly frustrating experience,2
1124,6696,doordash,719972451,2022-11-17 19:01:32,Incredibly frustrating experience,when i order food for delivery many times they will have more than one other person to deliver before me so i get cold food when it arrives even when the driver has thermal equipment to keep the food in,2
1124,6697,doordash,719972451,2022-11-17 19:01:32,Incredibly frustrating experience,when i order for pick up the app gets incredibly confusing,2
1124,6698,doordash,719972451,2022-11-17 19:01:32,Incredibly frustrating experience,it constantly suggest locations to me that are not the closest and the address for the place does not even show up until the check out,2
1124,6699,doordash,719972451,2022-11-17 19:01:32,Incredibly frustrating experience,and then i go to my usual location thinking it is fine since i have order from those places many times before only to find out it is a whole other location i have never been to,2
1124,6700,doordash,719972451,2022-11-17 19:01:32,Incredibly frustrating experience,there are no warnings or anything to tell you this is not the closest location when you are ordering and if it is frustrating for a person that is used to apps i cannot imagine how infuriating it would be for more technologically challenged people,2
1124,6701,doordash,719972451,2022-11-17 19:01:32,Incredibly frustrating experience,on top of that when restaurants have gotten my orders wrong i am only given a partial refund for my order even though i now have a meal i cannot eat,2
1124,6702,doordash,719972451,2022-11-17 19:01:32,Incredibly frustrating experience,i originally got this app because it was cheaper than uber eats with decent service but now the prices are about the same so i do not see a point anymore,2
1124,6703,doordash,719972451,2022-11-17 19:01:32,Incredibly frustrating experience,really disappointed,2
1125,6704,doordash,719972451,2022-11-11 22:56:53,I'm so over it.,honestly used to love doordash,2
1125,6705,doordash,719972451,2022-11-11 22:56:53,I'm so over it.,i am going to give it a 2 because it was recently at a 1,2
1125,6706,doordash,719972451,2022-11-11 22:56:53,I'm so over it.,the only reason for that is 1 star for the restaurants because they always make the food on point and it is usually never them,2
1125,6707,doordash,719972451,2022-11-11 22:56:53,I'm so over it.,the second star is because door dash used to be good,2
1125,6708,doordash,719972451,2022-11-11 22:56:53,I'm so over it.,but what in the world has been going on with the past deliveries,2
1125,6709,doordash,719972451,2022-11-11 22:56:53,I'm so over it.,every delivery that i have placed in the past 23 months has been so terrible and it is been about 6 times,2
1125,6710,doordash,719972451,2022-11-11 22:56:53,I'm so over it.,this is definitely my last as i am currently waiting again for more than 1 hour for my food all because of other deliveries,2
1125,6711,doordash,719972451,2022-11-11 22:56:53,I'm so over it.,what is the point of ordering food and calling yourself door dash if you are not going to be either of those things,2
1125,6712,doordash,719972451,2022-11-11 22:56:53,I'm so over it.,the food has been taking at least 2 hours every time to be delivered,2
1125,6713,doordash,719972451,2022-11-11 22:56:53,I'm so over it.,the longest i have waited was 2 hours and 45 minutes,2
1125,6714,doordash,719972451,2022-11-11 22:56:53,I'm so over it.,i am not sure if it is the drivers or door dash but i do not want to return as a customer because this is simply ridiculous,2
1125,6715,doordash,719972451,2022-11-11 22:56:53,I'm so over it.,they pass right by your house,2
1125,6716,doordash,719972451,2022-11-11 22:56:53,I'm so over it.,it is not even like they go to a spot down the block you see them jumping on high way and are stuck where it is they probably have went,2
1125,6717,doordash,719972451,2022-11-11 22:56:53,I'm so over it.,oh and then when you ask half the time they never respond,2
1125,6718,doordash,719972451,2022-11-11 22:56:53,I'm so over it.,there has to be a better algorithm or your going to lose your customers,2
1125,6719,doordash,719972451,2022-11-11 22:56:53,I'm so over it.,if i wanted to wait 3 hours for food i can go walk and pick it up,2

1126,6721,doordash,719972451,2022-10-12 21:01:10,BEWARE FOR NO FAIR REFUND & SOLUTIONS,in my experience to recent events deliveries have been miss delivered to wrong complexes or apartments,1
1126,6722,doordash,719972451,2022-10-12 21:01:10,BEWARE FOR NO FAIR REFUND & SOLUTIONS,due to this issue i have had reordered sometimes repeating the miss delivery,1
1126,6723,doordash,719972451,2022-10-12 21:01:10,BEWARE FOR NO FAIR REFUND & SOLUTIONS,however some dashers call the customers to make sure the order is in your possession by the correct building floor and apt,1
1126,6724,doordash,719972451,2022-10-12 21:01:10,BEWARE FOR NO FAIR REFUND & SOLUTIONS,in my last order doordash has miss delivered and denied any sort of refund or help,1
1126,6725,doordash,719972451,2022-10-12 21:01:10,BEWARE FOR NO FAIR REFUND & SOLUTIONS,in contacting support all i am told is that they cannot process any sort of transaction and there is nothing they can do for me however there is many things that can be done,1

1128,6743,doordash,719972451,2022-09-30 15:10:27,Mixed experience,the date and time i preset was noon on that particular day,2
1128,6744,doordash,719972451,2022-09-30 15:10:27,Mixed experience,when i closed the order it sent it to the restaurant and dasher immediately,2
1128,6745,doordash,719972451,2022-09-30 15:10:27,Mixed experience,it was delivered within 30 minutes  2 12 hours before our scheduled lunch meeting time and before the time i entered when i set up the prescheduled delivery,2
1128,6746,doordash,719972451,2022-09-30 15:10:27,Mixed experience,if the app is not going to remember a prescheduled delivery time do not make that an option,2

1128,6749,doordash,719972451,2022-09-30 15:10:27,Mixed experience,however the instructions for placing group orders are nebulous and not all restaurants have a group order link but it does not really say why,2
1128,6750,doordash,719972451,2022-09-30 15:10:27,Mixed experience,also did not know that a restaurant we tried to order with had 100 max,2

1128,6753,doordash,719972451,2022-09-30 15:10:27,Mixed experience,lunch was late because of that,2
1128,6754,doordash,719972451,2022-09-30 15:10:27,Mixed experience,that was after they are placed an order with one restaurant that turned out to be closed that day,2

1130,6772,doordash,719972451,2022-10-26 07:19:13,Hit or miss,so that is what i really enjoy  doordash i can put in an order real quick and i can have warm food for when i am too busy to really stop and take a moment to cook or go get something myself,2
1130,6773,doordash,719972451,2022-10-26 07:19:13,Hit or miss,lately tho it just has not been pulling through i get you guys get busy at certain times but lately there is been a lot of problems a lot of the time it is a struggle to even get a dasher or when i do get assigned a dasher the communication between the company and the dasher is so poor that my food was almost delivered across town,2
1130,6774,doordash,719972451,2022-10-26 07:19:13,Hit or miss,i really enjoy the services normally so it is sad to see if not live up,2
1130,6775,doordash,719972451,2022-10-26 07:19:13,Hit or miss,it is crazy how much more expensive it is to order through doordash and the customer support is literally the worst customer support i have ever seen ninety percent of the time they do not actually do anything to really help you i had to wait an hour and a half just to get mcdonalds,2
1130,6776,doordash,719972451,2022-10-26 07:19:13,Hit or miss,if i had the extra time to make my own food at home or go out then i would more then gladly but it is not always that easy,2
1130,6777,doordash,719972451,2022-10-26 07:19:13,Hit or miss,this company has honestly taken such a bad turn from what it started out as,2
1131,6778,doordash,719972451,2022-12-21 00:54:49,Poor Service,this service is sometimes terrible and the company just does not care,1
1131,6779,doordash,719972451,2022-12-21 00:54:49,Poor Service,i ordered from a local restaurant tonight,1
1131,6780,doordash,719972451,2022-12-21 00:54:49,Poor Service,after having my delivery time moved later and later for 45 minutes with no response from my driver i inquired with a live door dash customer service rep as to the whereabouts of my order,1
1131,6781,doordash,719972451,2022-12-21 00:54:49,Poor Service,while they were giving me a bunch or corporate speak about how they take food freshness and temperature so seriously the dasher texted me to say that they were given a second delivery from the same restaurant that was taking longer than mine,1
1131,6782,doordash,719972451,2022-12-21 00:54:49,Poor Service,i mean the restaurant is 15 minutes away,1
1131,6783,doordash,719972451,2022-12-21 00:54:49,Poor Service,they could have delivered and returned to the restaurant easily enough,1
1131,6784,doordash,719972451,2022-12-21 00:54:49,Poor Service,while i appreciated the response from the dasher it was completely opposite everything the customer service rep was telling me,1
1131,6785,doordash,719972451,2022-12-21 00:54:49,Poor Service,when i let the customer service rep know that the dasher contradicted them they immediately ended and deleted the thread,1
1131,6786,doordash,719972451,2022-12-21 00:54:49,Poor Service,about 10 minutes later the dasher brought my food with an apology,1
1131,6787,doordash,719972451,2022-12-21 00:54:49,Poor Service,the food was 45 minutes oldnot good,1
1131,6788,doordash,719972451,2022-12-21 00:54:49,Poor Service,honestly i have had both good and bad experiences but you should know that there will be times they ruin your evening and they really do not care,1
1131,6789,doordash,719972451,2022-12-21 00:54:49,Poor Service,i am sure they have a well crafted response to posts like this but they just do not really care about the customer or your experience,1
1132,6790,doordash,719972451,2022-09-30 21:52:05,Remove Multiple Orders Feature,some time after coming out doordash added the feature for dashers to complete other orders nearby,2
1132,6791,doordash,719972451,2022-09-30 21:52:05,Remove Multiple Orders Feature,then after creating this problem where the customers food gets cold doordash solved the problem by allowing the customer to pay extra for direct delivery,2
1132,6792,doordash,719972451,2022-09-30 21:52:05,Remove Multiple Orders Feature,it is ridiculous to ask the customer to pay extra to solve the problem you created,2
1132,6793,doordash,719972451,2022-09-30 21:52:05,Remove Multiple Orders Feature,numerous times i have gotten cold food regardless of how good the driver is,2
1132,6794,doordash,719972451,2022-09-30 21:52:05,Remove Multiple Orders Feature,sometimes the nearby customer will not come to their door or the nearby order is not nearby at all,2
1132,6795,doordash,719972451,2022-09-30 21:52:05,Remove Multiple Orders Feature,if it was not for the fact that i enjoy hot food this would not be a problem i can wait a little longer for my food but it gets cold,2
1132,6796,doordash,719972451,2022-09-30 21:52:05,Remove Multiple Orders Feature,without this feature i would give doordash five stars as a customer until then it is two,2
1132,6797,doordash,719972451,2022-09-30 21:52:05,Remove Multiple Orders Feature,i assume the multiple orders feature was only added to appease the dashers who were not being payed properly,2
1132,6798,doordash,719972451,2022-09-30 21:52:05,Remove Multiple Orders Feature,but maybe instead of putting that onto the customer you just pay your dashers fairlyside note i would also love if they could add a feature to see the car your dasher is driving a color and make or something,2
1132,6799,doordash,719972451,2022-09-30 21:52:05,Remove Multiple Orders Feature,i live in a city where the dashers have a hard time finding me and i would love to be able to pick out their car and wave them over,2
1133,6800,doordash,719972451,2022-11-30 23:50:25,Thieves! Rude! Not safe to use!,today i placed an order with dd and received someone elses order,1
1133,6801,doordash,719972451,2022-11-30 23:50:25,Thieves! Rude! Not safe to use!,i contacted dd customer service and asked them to please send out another dasher to deliver my order since the wrong order was delivered,1

1133,6804,doordash,719972451,2022-11-30 23:50:25,Thieves! Rude! Not safe to use!,mind you this so called compensation i received previously was nearly 800 charged to my credit card that i in no way charged and could not find any of these charges on my dd account,1
1133,6805,doordash,719972451,2022-11-30 23:50:25,Thieves! Rude! Not safe to use!,as a matter of fact i was told by one of their customer service reps that sometimes this happens and unfortunately people hack into their system and steal customer information,1
1133,6806,doordash,719972451,2022-11-30 23:50:25,Thieves! Rude! Not safe to use!,so not only is our information not secure but basically because my banks fraud department investigated and found these charges were not mine dd has decided to steal my money when there is mistakes made by the restaurant,1
1133,6807,doordash,719972451,2022-11-30 23:50:25,Thieves! Rude! Not safe to use!,i guess from now on i just need to pick up my own stuff,1

1133,6809,doordash,719972451,2022-11-30 23:50:25,Thieves! Rude! Not safe to use!,for all i know it was dd themselves or one of their many rude customer service representatives that charged nearly 800 to my card,1

1135,6830,doordash,719972451,2022-12-15 02:27:18,Shady Practices,it is not worth the risk,1
1135,6831,doordash,719972451,2022-12-15 02:27:18,Shady Practices,if you have the ability to get in your car and go to the restaurant,1
1135,6832,doordash,719972451,2022-12-15 02:27:18,Shady Practices,doordash does not compensate their drivers fairly literally steals money from customers and their business practices are harmful to smaller restaurants,1
1135,6833,doordash,719972451,2022-12-15 02:27:18,Shady Practices,they are the worst choice for food delivery and should be avoided at all costs,1
1135,6834,doordash,719972451,2022-12-15 02:27:18,Shady Practices,doordash overall is a nice concept but the execution is poor here,1
1135,6835,doordash,719972451,2022-12-15 02:27:18,Shady Practices,their delivery fees are understandable however they do not do anything to stop drivers from taking your food or to insure that drivers are incentivized enough to get your order,1
1135,6836,doordash,719972451,2022-12-15 02:27:18,Shady Practices,my most recent purchase was completely wrong to the fault of the restaurant,1
1135,6837,doordash,719972451,2022-12-15 02:27:18,Shady Practices,unfortunately i had to go through doordash to rectify this,1
1135,6838,doordash,719972451,2022-12-15 02:27:18,Shady Practices,they credited me for the burger but no the large 399 delivery fee,1
1135,6839,doordash,719972451,2022-12-15 02:27:18,Shady Practices,the food i received i physically could not even eat yet doordash still passes the cost along to the consumer,1
1135,6840,doordash,719972451,2022-12-15 02:27:18,Shady Practices,they are very anticonsumer and they are not great to the drivers either with deliveries that take up to 30 minutes for 2,1
1136,6841,doordash,719972451,2022-09-26 14:51:06,Scammers at their finest,door dash has made it impossible to cancel your dash pass subscription,1
1136,6842,doordash,719972451,2022-09-26 14:51:06,Scammers at their finest,they will try every card on your account and you always have to have at least one card on file,1
1136,6843,doordash,719972451,2022-09-26 14:51:06,Scammers at their finest,the only way to cancel is by calling i did so and got confirmation of the cancellation yet i was still charged,1
1136,6844,doordash,719972451,2022-09-26 14:51:06,Scammers at their finest,called again they transferred me 3 times for literally no reason and eventually sent me to the post call survey,1
1136,6845,doordash,719972451,2022-09-26 14:51:06,Scammers at their finest,the first woman on the phone was yelling at me about how there was no cancellation in their system when i repeatedly stated that i had an email saying the opposite,1
1136,6846,doordash,719972451,2022-09-26 14:51:06,Scammers at their finest,they want me to provide the date of the charge card number exact amountmy apple credit card does not have numbers and i should not have to go through the trouble of finding one whatever that process may look like,1
1136,6847,doordash,719972451,2022-09-26 14:51:06,Scammers at their finest,how could it be possible that they do not have the information themselves,1
1136,6848,doordash,719972451,2022-09-26 14:51:06,Scammers at their finest,they have no issue taking my money but it seem like the customer service employees are trained to be horrible and do whatever they can to never give money back,1
1136,6849,doordash,719972451,2022-09-26 14:51:06,Scammers at their finest,be aware of this scam,1
1136,6850,doordash,719972451,2022-09-26 14:51:06,Scammers at their finest,this company has gotten so bad,1
1136,6851,doordash,719972451,2022-09-26 14:51:06,Scammers at their finest,in addition to that i recently ordered food that came hours late and was cold surprise door dash offered 347 in credit,1
1136,6852,doordash,719972451,2022-09-26 14:51:06,Scammers at their finest,i use to use this app as my go to for delivery but never again,1
1137,6853,doordash,719972451,2022-09-19 19:19:08,Used to be a loyal customer,however their delivery drivers get worse and worse,1
1137,6854,doordash,719972451,2022-09-19 19:19:08,Used to be a loyal customer,they cannot follow instructions deliver it to the wrong location are impossible to get ahold of and then are incredibly rude about helping you when it comes to fixing their mistakes,1
1137,6855,doordash,719972451,2022-09-19 19:19:08,Used to be a loyal customer,i will no longer use the app but beware a lot of restaurants still use doordash as a third party delivery service,1
1137,6856,doordash,719972451,2022-09-19 19:19:08,Used to be a loyal customer,so even if you order from the restaurant directly it is doordash that delivers it and then it is even more difficult to fix issues the drivers cause because the restaurant will tell you to call doordash and doordash will tell you they cannot help you since you did not place the order through their app,1
1137,6857,doordash,719972451,2022-09-19 19:19:08,Used to be a loyal customer,granted they are good about issuing refunds but a lot of the time i do not need or want the money back i just want my order delivered correctly,1
1137,6858,doordash,719972451,2022-09-19 19:19:08,Used to be a loyal customer,also the doordash subscription is purposely very easy to sign up for,1
1137,6859,doordash,719972451,2022-09-19 19:19:08,Used to be a loyal customer,i cannot tell you how many times i have accidentally hit that button and did not know it until my account was being drafted,1
1137,6860,doordash,719972451,2022-09-19 19:19:08,Used to be a loyal customer,it happened on my work credit card once and they do not issue refunds so i had to pay my company back the money out of my pocket,1
1137,6861,doordash,719972451,2022-09-19 19:19:08,Used to be a loyal customer,my recommendation is to skip doordash and stick with a different delivery service,1
1137,6862,doordash,719972451,2022-09-19 19:19:08,Used to be a loyal customer,uber eats has always been great for me,1

1138,6876,doordash,719972451,2022-12-06 20:32:25,Use uber eats - DD has Horrible customer service,cuz what they did was pretty bad under the circumstances,1
1138,6878,doordash,719972451,2022-12-06 20:32:25,Use uber eats - DD has Horrible customer service,no apology from customer service no response to multiple messages of complaint zilch,1

1139,6883,doordash,719972451,2022-12-04 18:20:58,Hard to find/try new places,for context i am trying out doordash as my new goto delivery app because i get complimentary dashpass with my new credit card,3
1139,6884,doordash,719972451,2022-12-04 18:20:58,Hard to find/try new places,the app is generally functional and looks nice if a bit busy from all the deals up top that i have no interest in but it was an infuriating experience trying to browse through available restaurants,3
1139,6885,doordash,719972451,2022-12-04 18:20:58,Hard to find/try new places,every time i clicked on a restaurant and spent more than a few seconds looking at its offerings hitting back arrow not reset,3
1139,6886,doordash,719972451,2022-12-04 18:20:58,Hard to find/try new places,would send me back to the top of the home page with my filters wiped,3
1139,6887,doordash,719972451,2022-12-04 18:20:58,Hard to find/try new places,this makes finding and trying new places inconvenient and an exercise in patience,3
1139,6888,doordash,719972451,2022-12-04 18:20:58,Hard to find/try new places,if i am being cynical maybe the idea is to make it so annoying to do so that the user just gives up and settles for whatever sponsored restaurants are at the top of the home page if they do not just give up on doordash,3
1139,6889,doordash,719972451,2022-12-04 18:20:58,Hard to find/try new places,i used ubereats primarily before and i hate to pull out the comparison card but while it has its own issues i have apparently been taking for granted being able to scroll through even a list of restaurants while checking out their menusin a food ordering app,3
1140,6890,doordash,719972451,2022-11-09 20:57:43,DoorDash is the absolute worst delivery service!,not sure if it is specific to washington state but doordash is the absolute worst delivery service out of all of them,1
1140,6891,doordash,719972451,2022-11-09 20:57:43,DoorDash is the absolute worst delivery service!,they constantly take an hour longer than it initially says to deliver,1
1140,6892,doordash,719972451,2022-11-09 20:57:43,DoorDash is the absolute worst delivery service!,i have never once had them within 30 mins of the initial delivery time sent,1
1140,6893,doordash,719972451,2022-11-09 20:57:43,DoorDash is the absolute worst delivery service!,i have also had them literally forget 95 of my order at the restaurant refuse to refund the delivery fee or the 25 tip i gave,1
1140,6894,doordash,719972451,2022-11-09 20:57:43,DoorDash is the absolute worst delivery service!,i had ordered a pizza from farrellis and a side salad i only received the side salad the delivery driver dropped it at my door did not knock and took off,1
1140,6895,doordash,719972451,2022-11-09 20:57:43,DoorDash is the absolute worst delivery service!,tried to call them to tell them they forgot the majority of my order and ignored my calls,1
1140,6896,doordash,719972451,2022-11-09 20:57:43,DoorDash is the absolute worst delivery service!,went to pick it up myself was told by farrellis that doordash should refund me it is separate from my order and they have no part in it,1
1140,6897,doordash,719972451,2022-11-09 20:57:43,DoorDash is the absolute worst delivery service!,the doordash customer service person was entirely useless told me it is not on them and they cannot refund me and to figure it out with farrellis,1
1140,6898,doordash,719972451,2022-11-09 20:57:43,DoorDash is the absolute worst delivery service!,i just gave up because it was only 14 and i had already wasted 45 minutes on the phone with doordash,1
1140,6899,doordash,719972451,2022-11-09 20:57:43,DoorDash is the absolute worst delivery service!,anytime i have used their service after has been by accident not realizing that is who the restaurant uses for delivery and every time i am frustrated and get my food an hour later,1
1140,6900,doordash,719972451,2022-11-09 20:57:43,DoorDash is the absolute worst delivery service!,it is a joke,1
1141,6901,doordash,719972451,2022-11-21 08:01:09,compensation,the dashers messed up repeatedly,1
1141,6902,doordash,719972451,2022-11-21 08:01:09,compensation,i mean almost every order,1
1141,6903,doordash,719972451,2022-11-21 08:01:09,compensation,once i got the completely wrong order,1
1141,6904,doordash,719972451,2022-11-21 08:01:09,compensation,most other times they missed a drink or some food item,1
1141,6905,doordash,719972451,2022-11-21 08:01:09,compensation,heres the thing,1
1141,6906,doordash,719972451,2022-11-21 08:01:09,compensation,it is fine if the item is missing or the completely wrong order if i get compensated,1
1141,6907,doordash,719972451,2022-11-21 08:01:09,compensation,i had been getting compensated up to this point rightfully so but today the dasher marked the order as delivered when i literally never got the food,1
1141,6908,doordash,719972451,2022-11-21 08:01:09,compensation,in fact the dasher was in the downtown of the city when he marked the order delivered when i live in the suburbs,1
1141,6909,doordash,719972451,2022-11-21 08:01:09,compensation,i did not get compensated for this,1
1141,6910,doordash,719972451,2022-11-21 08:01:09,compensation,doordashs reason was that i was compensated in the previous orders,1
1141,6911,doordash,719972451,2022-11-21 08:01:09,compensation,i understand that doordash may think i am scamming for credit but most of the times there was not even an option to submit photos or videos to prove that what i am saying was the truth,1
1141,6912,doordash,719972451,2022-11-21 08:01:09,compensation,so currently i am sitting here with no credit for the food that i paid for but did not get no food the dasher either ate it or delivered it to some random person and the restaurants near me are closed because the dasher had already taken an hour to pick up the food,1
1141,6913,doordash,719972451,2022-11-21 08:01:09,compensation,at least compensate me but no because doordashs customer support is extremely closed minded unsupportive and very rigid,1
1141,6914,doordash,719972451,2022-11-21 08:01:09,compensation,extremely furious,1
1142,6915,doordash,719972451,2022-11-29 03:21:48,Door Dash is good but the app is broke,i have never had a problem with the service of door dash any time my order was messed up which is rare they are super cool about refunding me and i have no complaints about my experiences as a customer,3
1142,6916,doordash,719972451,2022-11-29 03:21:48,Door Dash is good but the app is broke,however a couple months or so ago the app on my phone became almost completely unusable,3
1142,6917,doordash,719972451,2022-11-29 03:21:48,Door Dash is good but the app is broke,you can barely scroll down the page it is super slow and glitchy and if you do manage to get an order in it is even harder to do double dash because the menus for other store just will not open it only lets me choose from the quick menu options that are right there immediately but if i try to open a stores page my app freezes and i have to re open,3
1142,6918,doordash,719972451,2022-11-29 03:21:48,Door Dash is good but the app is broke,i normally like to get a 2 liter from 711 any time i order a meal and double dash was perfect for that but now it is so much of a hassle that it is not even worth it,3
1142,6919,doordash,719972451,2022-11-29 03:21:48,Door Dash is good but the app is broke,i have deleted and re downloaded the app a few times and looked for updates and fixes and all of that but no luck,3
1142,6920,doordash,719972451,2022-11-29 03:21:48,Door Dash is good but the app is broke,i am at the point where i deleted the app and if i really need to use door dash in the future i will just get on the computer,3

1144,6933,doordash,719972451,2022-10-25 18:41:01,Worst Food Delivery App,i have used doordash a total of 4 times and they have messed up my order 3 of those 4 times,1
1144,6934,doordash,719972451,2022-10-25 18:41:01,Worst Food Delivery App,i am vegetarian and cannot eat any meat and every time they tend to give me meat dishes instead of the vegetarian dishes i had ordered,1
1144,6935,doordash,719972451,2022-10-25 18:41:01,Worst Food Delivery App,i end up having to throw my food away,1
1144,6936,doordash,719972451,2022-10-25 18:41:01,Worst Food Delivery App,the credits they issue when they mess up your order do not compensate for the money lost for example i ordered one dish from a restaurant and my total after taxes tip etc,1
1144,6937,doordash,719972451,2022-10-25 18:41:01,Worst Food Delivery App,ended up being around 20,1
1144,6938,doordash,719972451,2022-10-25 18:41:01,Worst Food Delivery App,when they messed up my order and gave me a meat dish which i had to throw away they only gave me 4 in credits,1
1144,6939,doordash,719972451,2022-10-25 18:41:01,Worst Food Delivery App,even when i called customer service they failed to give me a full refund and got away with only giving me 10 back,1
1144,6940,doordash,719972451,2022-10-25 18:41:01,Worst Food Delivery App,i essentially lost 10 through no fault of my own,1
1144,6941,doordash,719972451,2022-10-25 18:41:01,Worst Food Delivery App,not only is this app a waste of money it is a waste of time,1
1144,6942,doordash,719972451,2022-10-25 18:41:01,Worst Food Delivery App,waiting an hour for your food just for it to be inedible and without even being fairly compensated for the mistake time after time is exhausting,1
1144,6943,doordash,719972451,2022-10-25 18:41:01,Worst Food Delivery App,do not bother using doordash and stick to other apps like grubhub,1
1144,6944,doordash,719972451,2022-10-25 18:41:01,Worst Food Delivery App,even though it is more expensive at least they never messed up my order,1
1145,6945,doordash,719972451,2022-12-18 01:00:38,Good but Dashers have been a problem for me.,i order doordash pretty regularly due to the nature of my job and most of the time it is fine and the food gets here on time and everything,4
1145,6946,doordash,719972451,2022-12-18 01:00:38,Good but Dashers have been a problem for me.,here lately i have multiple orders in a row where my dasher either never makes it to the store or they go somewhere way out of the way,4
1145,6947,doordash,719972451,2022-12-18 01:00:38,Good but Dashers have been a problem for me.,the last two orders i have placed both had to be canceled,4
1145,6948,doordash,719972451,2022-12-18 01:00:38,Good but Dashers have been a problem for me.,one was for the dollar general two miles down the road from where i was working and the dasher parked across the street from the store for over an hour at least that is what i could see on the map,4
1145,6949,doordash,719972451,2022-12-18 01:00:38,Good but Dashers have been a problem for me.,ultimately he never went inside and the store closed and i had to talk to customer service for a refund because the app refused to refund me due to the order already being started,4
1145,6950,doordash,719972451,2022-12-18 01:00:38,Good but Dashers have been a problem for me.,then tonight i ordered from one of my favorite restaurants and the driver drove almost to the next town over and did not move for more than 30 minutes before finally i get a call saying there was an emergency and my order was canceled,4
1145,6951,doordash,719972451,2022-12-18 01:00:38,Good but Dashers have been a problem for me.,gotta say i am pretty angry about it,4
1146,6952,doordash,719972451,2022-12-12 16:45:22,I wish I didn't have to do this,update door dash so kindly gave me my account back allowed me to pay for dash pass twice while simultaneously deactivating my account,1
1146,6954,doordash,719972451,2022-12-12 16:45:22,I wish I didn't have to do this,and i have deleted the app but somehow they are still using my location,1
1146,6955,doordash,719972451,2022-12-12 16:45:22,I wish I didn't have to do this,so done with this app and company 1010 would not recommend after calling and calling since august i was finally told today they deactivated my account due to violation of term and conditions but they do not know what terms and conditions were violated and did not have the ability to reactivate my account or refund my money,1
1146,6956,doordash,719972451,2022-12-12 16:45:22,I wish I didn't have to do this,also nobody at the company could tell me why,1
1146,6957,doordash,719972451,2022-12-12 16:45:22,I wish I didn't have to do this,when i asked if i created another account if it would be deactivated i am not even kidding you when i say a tier 2 csr hung up on me,1
1146,6958,doordash,719972451,2022-12-12 16:45:22,I wish I didn't have to do this,worst absolute worst experience with customer service i have ever had,1
1146,6959,doordash,719972451,2022-12-12 16:45:22,I wish I didn't have to do this,my account was deactivated and nobody can tell me why i have waited since tuesday it is now saturday for it to be reactivated when they said it would be fixed in 24 hours,1
1146,6960,doordash,719972451,2022-12-12 16:45:22,I wish I didn't have to do this,i have also waited for a refund from them since may its now august customer service escalates the concerns to tier 2 but nothing is ever fixed,1
1146,6961,doordash,719972451,2022-12-12 16:45:22,I wish I didn't have to do this,i am seriously over doordash and their shotty customer service,1
1146,6962,doordash,719972451,2022-12-12 16:45:22,I wish I didn't have to do this,the local delivery drivers are excellent but the csr line pathetic,1
1147,6963,doordash,719972451,2022-10-30 18:30:36,Crap app even support doesn't know how to use,i placed an order for a restaurant near me via doordash,1
1147,6964,doordash,719972451,2022-10-30 18:30:36,Crap app even support doesn't know how to use,it said i can pick up in 40 min so i walked away to do other things during this time,1
1147,6965,doordash,719972451,2022-10-30 18:30:36,Crap app even support doesn't know how to use,when i came back doordash said my order is canceled,1
1147,6966,doordash,719972451,2022-10-30 18:30:36,Crap app even support doesn't know how to use,i called the restaurant to find out why and was told doordash attached a nuts allergy note to my order and they cannot honor it,1
1147,6967,doordash,719972451,2022-10-30 18:30:36,Crap app even support doesn't know how to use,this is the second time this happened,1
1147,6968,doordash,719972451,2022-10-30 18:30:36,Crap app even support doesn't know how to use,i start chat support with doordash to get them to remove it,1
1147,6969,doordash,719972451,2022-10-30 18:30:36,Crap app even support doesn't know how to use,after spending more than an hour with doordash chat support i was told they cannot remove it that i have to remove it and i can do it via settings  blue pencil icon,1
1147,6970,doordash,719972451,2022-10-30 18:30:36,Crap app even support doesn't know how to use,i did not see it and asked them where it is starting from ios app home page,1
1147,6971,doordash,719972451,2022-10-30 18:30:36,Crap app even support doesn't know how to use,they again can not answer and transferred me twice to special departments and ultimately has to open up a case to try to answer my question,1
1147,6972,doordash,719972451,2022-10-30 18:30:36,Crap app even support doesn't know how to use,what a disaster,1
1147,6973,doordash,719972451,2022-10-30 18:30:36,Crap app even support doesn't know how to use,eight different people via chat support and everyone just reads from a script and no one actually knows where this mythical settings button is,1
1147,6974,doordash,719972451,2022-10-30 18:30:36,Crap app even support doesn't know how to use,the app is so poorly designed and causes time to be unnecessarily wasted leaving you angry and still hungry,1
1147,6975,doordash,719972451,2022-10-30 18:30:36,Crap app even support doesn't know how to use,ultimately it cannot even do what it is made to do which is to order food and make sure you get it,1
1148,6976,doordash,719972451,2022-11-24 01:44:21,Horrible customer service now,i have been using doordash for a couple years and i am a very good and loyal customer,1
1148,6977,doordash,719972451,2022-11-24 01:44:21,Horrible customer service now,their customer service used to be very good,1
1148,6978,doordash,719972451,2022-11-24 01:44:21,Horrible customer service now,over the last few months it has gotten terrible,1
1148,6979,doordash,719972451,2022-11-24 01:44:21,Horrible customer service now,the orders are late and cold because your dasher is waiting at the restaurant for multiple orders and delivering more than one order at a time,1
1148,6980,doordash,719972451,2022-11-24 01:44:21,Horrible customer service now,the dasher was rude when i messaged him regarding my concern for the food quality for the late delivery,1
1148,6981,doordash,719972451,2022-11-24 01:44:21,Horrible customer service now,when you try to contact customer service it gets worse,1
1148,6982,doordash,719972451,2022-11-24 01:44:21,Horrible customer service now,my last experience was when i was disconnected by a rude agent via chat before my issue was resolved,1
1148,6983,doordash,719972451,2022-11-24 01:44:21,Horrible customer service now,then my food showed up late and cold with one whole meal missing,1
1148,6984,doordash,719972451,2022-11-24 01:44:21,Horrible customer service now,when i recontacted the service they told me the only thing they could do for me was refund the missing meal,1
1148,6985,doordash,719972451,2022-11-24 01:44:21,Horrible customer service now,they would not even do a reorder of the meal,1
1148,6986,doordash,719972451,2022-11-24 01:44:21,Horrible customer service now,they offered 5 as compensation which was insulting and they did not even give it to me,1
1148,6987,doordash,719972451,2022-11-24 01:44:21,Horrible customer service now,then when i asked to talk to a supervisor i was told it would take 224 hours because they were not available,1
1148,6988,doordash,719972451,2022-11-24 01:44:21,Horrible customer service now,when i did get a call there was nothing they could do but report the issue,1
1148,6989,doordash,719972451,2022-11-24 01:44:21,Horrible customer service now,i am extremely dissatisfied with doordash and i will never use them again,1
1148,6990,doordash,719972451,2022-11-24 01:44:21,Horrible customer service now,horrible service just awful,1
1149,6991,doordash,719972451,2022-10-29 04:54:06,"Ordered a chicken sandwich, got a pizza",very disappointed,1
1149,6992,doordash,719972451,2022-10-29 04:54:06,"Ordered a chicken sandwich, got a pizza",we placed an order for two chicken sandwiches from our favorite local restaurant,1
1149,6993,doordash,719972451,2022-10-29 04:54:06,"Ordered a chicken sandwich, got a pizza",our delivery driver knocked on the door and when we opened it there was a pizza left on our porch from a different restaurant close by,1
1149,6994,doordash,719972451,2022-10-29 04:54:06,"Ordered a chicken sandwich, got a pizza",we tried calling doordash and after waiting on hold for an excessive amount of time and going back and forth between people we were refunded,1
1149,6995,doordash,719972451,2022-10-29 04:54:06,"Ordered a chicken sandwich, got a pizza",i know it seems silly but we had just had pizza from the restaurant the pizza was from and we really wanted the sandwiches we ordered,1
1149,6996,doordash,719972451,2022-10-29 04:54:06,"Ordered a chicken sandwich, got a pizza",unfortunately that restaurant was closing in 5 minutes after we were finished with the phone call with doordash which took a very long time at least 45 minutes so they were not taking anymore orders,1
1149,6997,doordash,719972451,2022-10-29 04:54:06,"Ordered a chicken sandwich, got a pizza",i am not able to write a review on the dasher because the order was placed through the restaurants website who i guess uses doordash for delivery,1
1149,6998,doordash,719972451,2022-10-29 04:54:06,"Ordered a chicken sandwich, got a pizza",i called the restaurant and they said they were having trouble with doordash today but there was nothing they could do which is incorrect and part of the reason i am writing this,1
1149,6999,doordash,719972451,2022-10-29 04:54:06,"Ordered a chicken sandwich, got a pizza",if there is any way i can review the driver please let me know,1
1149,7000,doordash,719972451,2022-10-29 04:54:06,"Ordered a chicken sandwich, got a pizza",i have not had many problems with doordash but this was lame,1
1150,7001,doordash,719972451,2022-11-18 03:39:58,Good but not great,it is very frustrating to me that doordash drivers try to fit as many orders as they can in one run because that is how they get paid the best,3
1150,7002,doordash,719972451,2022-11-18 03:39:58,Good but not great,tonight i ordered food that was supposed to be delivered at 712pm but it did not actually get delivered until 735pm,3
1150,7003,doordash,719972451,2022-11-18 03:39:58,Good but not great,i watched my driver go from the restaurant that had my food to a location 3 miles from me to another location back to the location 3 miles from me to another place and then finally to me all the while the driver had my food,3
1150,7004,doordash,719972451,2022-11-18 03:39:58,Good but not great,i just think that doordash could do better about delivery time estimates,3
1150,7005,doordash,719972451,2022-11-18 03:39:58,Good but not great,i got a text from the app at 709pm saying your driver is close by so i went outside but then i looked at my app and realized my driver was delivering other dashes nearby,3
1150,7006,doordash,719972451,2022-11-18 03:39:58,Good but not great,i finally went back inside and waited for my driver to text me,3
1150,7007,doordash,719972451,2022-11-18 03:39:58,Good but not great,i do not blame the driver i know they are doing their best and making money,3
1150,7008,doordash,719972451,2022-11-18 03:39:58,Good but not great,i just wish the app would tell me all of this before it confirms my order to be delivered at 712pm,3
1150,7009,doordash,719972451,2022-11-18 03:39:58,Good but not great,i really think it is the fault of the app and people paying the drivers,3
1150,7010,doordash,719972451,2022-11-18 03:39:58,Good but not great,it is in no way the drivers fault,3
1151,7011,doordash,719972451,2022-11-05 23:29:23,Payment Method Error,i have been using this app for several years now and i love using this app,1
1151,7012,doordash,719972451,2022-11-05 23:29:23,Payment Method Error,up until recently whenever i try to place an order i keep getting this message saying whoops try a different payment method,1
1151,7013,doordash,719972451,2022-11-05 23:29:23,Payment Method Error,the first time it happened i called and spoke to support they were very helpful escalated the situation and it got fixed the next day and i was able to use as normal,1
1151,7014,doordash,719972451,2022-11-05 23:29:23,Payment Method Error,then about a week later when i tried to use it again i got the same error message again,1
1151,7015,doordash,719972451,2022-11-05 23:29:23,Payment Method Error,i contact support through the chat and over the phone and have not been able to get any help,1
1151,7016,doordash,719972451,2022-11-05 23:29:23,Payment Method Error,there is nothing wrong with my cards they work everywhere else just fine i have tried apple pay adding different cards i did an update on my phone and the app i deleted the app and downloaded again and still having the same problem,1
1151,7017,doordash,719972451,2022-11-05 23:29:23,Payment Method Error,i even bought a giftcard through the doordash app mind youredeemed the gift in the app to give myself a credit and i still get the same message when trying to place an order,1
1151,7018,doordash,719972451,2022-11-05 23:29:23,Payment Method Error,so i have 25 stuck in the app that i cannot even use,1
1151,7019,doordash,719972451,2022-11-05 23:29:23,Payment Method Error,i have done all the troubleshooting that can be done and still having the same problem,1
1151,7020,doordash,719972451,2022-11-05 23:29:23,Payment Method Error,hopefully some in upper management sees this review and fixes the issue with app,1
1152,7021,doordash,719972451,2022-12-13 16:07:42,Sigh…,i think door dash should switch some things around,3
1152,7022,doordash,719972451,2022-12-13 16:07:42,Sigh…,the first thing they should do is switch the order of the process,3
1152,7023,doordash,719972451,2022-12-13 16:07:42,Sigh…,i think the restaurant and dasher should accept your order before it is prepared,3
1152,7024,doordash,719972451,2022-12-13 16:07:42,Sigh…,the second thing they should do is allow you to switch your order from delivery to pick up if it is taking too long or if the order has not been accepted by a dasher,3
1152,7025,doordash,719972451,2022-12-13 16:07:42,Sigh…,for example i ordered breakfast from a place about 15 minutes from my house,3
1152,7026,doordash,719972451,2022-12-13 16:07:42,Sigh…,door dash accepted the order and i got a notification that it was being made,3
1152,7027,doordash,719972451,2022-12-13 16:07:42,Sigh…,45 minutes went by before a dasher even accepted my order,3
1152,7028,doordash,719972451,2022-12-13 16:07:42,Sigh…,then i had to wait for them to arrive,3
1152,7029,doordash,719972451,2022-12-13 16:07:42,Sigh…,i was already aware i was taking a risk by ordering a hot drink with whipped cream but was disappointed knowing that it sat 45 minutes and was going to be a flop regardless,3
1152,7030,doordash,719972451,2022-12-13 16:07:42,Sigh…,my food was cold and subpar,3
1152,7031,doordash,719972451,2022-12-13 16:07:42,Sigh…,while waiting i looked through the app to see if i could switch it to pick up since it had been so long and no one accepted the order yet but could not find that option,3
1152,7032,doordash,719972451,2022-12-13 16:07:42,Sigh…,i would have been better off picking it up,3
1153,7033,doordash,719972451,2022-11-19 03:33:25,Bad night?,me and my girlfriend always have little date nights through door dash being we are doing a long distance relationship,1
1153,7034,doordash,719972451,2022-11-19 03:33:25,Bad night?,now do not get me wrong it is been okay,1
1153,7035,doordash,719972451,2022-11-19 03:33:25,Bad night?,only little screwups like missing napkins condiments delivered one house down from our houses ext,1
1153,7036,doordash,719972451,2022-11-19 03:33:25,Bad night?,tonight was different though,1

1154,7047,doordash,719972451,2022-10-26 22:50:51,No refund and No food,it is really inconvenient when your told one thing by a dasher or rep on the phone and there is not upper management to oversee the issues,1
1154,7048,doordash,719972451,2022-10-26 22:50:51,No refund and No food,my daughter order food and when she noticed the order went to my brothers address she called to change the address,1

1154,7050,doordash,719972451,2022-10-26 22:50:51,No refund and No food,but they advised her they would cancel the order and she would receive a refund,1
1154,7051,doordash,719972451,2022-10-26 22:50:51,No refund and No food,after a week and no refund i called,1

1154,7054,doordash,719972451,2022-10-26 22:50:51,No refund and No food,so you mean to tell me she loses 42 and the dasher just got free chickfila,1
1154,7055,doordash,719972451,2022-10-26 22:50:51,No refund and No food,that is does not seem right they should still be required to deliver the order to the address listed because i would have driven to get it,1
1154,7056,doordash,719972451,2022-10-26 22:50:51,No refund and No food,it has now been 3 weeks after calling in 3 times and still not receiving a call back in 24 hrs as i was told we are done with doordash,1

1155,7061,doordash,719972451,2022-11-30 19:31:43,Company steals your money,zero stars should really be an option,1
1155,7062,doordash,719972451,2022-11-30 19:31:43,Company steals your money,this is a shady company who will steal your money and customer support is a travesty,1
1155,7063,doordash,719972451,2022-11-30 19:31:43,Company steals your money,randomly started getting charged in october for a dashpass when i have not used doordash since may,1
1155,7064,doordash,719972451,2022-11-30 19:31:43,Company steals your money,the few times i used the app my orders were always missing items which is not necessarily the fault of the drivers,1
1155,7065,doordash,719972451,2022-11-30 19:31:43,Company steals your money,so whatever,1
1155,7066,doordash,719972451,2022-11-30 19:31:43,Company steals your money,my main issue is the random unauthorized charges,1
1155,7067,doordash,719972451,2022-11-30 19:31:43,Company steals your money,i go on the app and there is no indication of having an active account to cancel and if there was there is not even an option to cancel,1
1155,7068,doordash,719972451,2022-11-30 19:31:43,Company steals your money,i go to the website and much the same,1
1155,7069,doordash,719972451,2022-11-30 19:31:43,Company steals your money,finally i get on customer support,1
1155,7070,doordash,719972451,2022-11-30 19:31:43,Company steals your money,the first agent confirms i do not have an active account and asks me for a screenshot of the unauthorized charges,1
1155,7071,doordash,719972451,2022-11-30 19:31:43,Company steals your money,they wait less than a minute before closing the chat,1
1155,7072,doordash,719972451,2022-11-30 19:31:43,Company steals your money,at this point i am beyond frustrated,1
1155,7073,doordash,719972451,2022-11-30 19:31:43,Company steals your money,hop on chat again with a different agent and they assured me it is canceled and i will not be charged again,1
1155,7074,doordash,719972451,2022-11-30 19:31:43,Company steals your money,i asked for an email confirmation of the cancellation and refund,1
1155,7075,doordash,719972451,2022-11-30 19:31:43,Company steals your money,i am still waiting to receive that if i ever do,1
1155,7076,doordash,719972451,2022-11-30 19:31:43,Company steals your money,we will see about the refund,1
1155,7077,doordash,719972451,2022-11-30 19:31:43,Company steals your money,do not use this app even once,1
1155,7078,doordash,719972451,2022-11-30 19:31:43,Company steals your money,they will start stealing your money,1
1156,7079,doordash,719972451,2022-10-23 02:39:44,Dashers don't follow instructions,heres the deal,1
1156,7080,doordash,719972451,2022-10-23 02:39:44,Dashers don't follow instructions,i use this app weekly and have been a monthly customer,1
1156,7081,doordash,719972451,2022-10-23 02:39:44,Dashers don't follow instructions,but all that is changing as of todaythis whole app is based off of people doing their job,1
1156,7082,doordash,719972451,2022-10-23 02:39:44,Dashers don't follow instructions,my dasher did not follow instructions,1
1156,7083,doordash,719972451,2022-10-23 02:39:44,Dashers don't follow instructions,i got a message saying need substitutions,1
1156,7084,doordash,719972451,2022-10-23 02:39:44,Dashers don't follow instructions,i entered them and minutes later it says order cancelled,1
1156,7085,doordash,719972451,2022-10-23 02:39:44,Dashers don't follow instructions,the protocol is the dasher contacts you,1
1156,7086,doordash,719972451,2022-10-23 02:39:44,Dashers don't follow instructions,then they ask if you want a credit or a refund,1
1156,7087,doordash,719972451,2022-10-23 02:39:44,Dashers don't follow instructions,i would have chosen credit bc i needed the cat food tonight and would have reordered,1
1156,7088,doordash,719972451,2022-10-23 02:39:44,Dashers don't follow instructions,the dasher did not follow protocol a second time,1
1156,7089,doordash,719972451,2022-10-23 02:39:44,Dashers don't follow instructions,so i had to reorder,1
1156,7090,doordash,719972451,2022-10-23 02:39:44,Dashers don't follow instructions,when i did doordash informed me that refunds take 57 days to process,1
1156,7091,doordash,719972451,2022-10-23 02:39:44,Dashers don't follow instructions,basically then you are out the 30 bucks a second time for 57 days,1
1156,7092,doordash,719972451,2022-10-23 02:39:44,Dashers don't follow instructions,i talked to an agent got transferred over 8 times,1
1156,7093,doordash,719972451,2022-10-23 02:39:44,Dashers don't follow instructions,then 1 hour and 20 minutes later they gave me a credit for my waste of time since i said i was leaving their app and no longer going to be a weekly user,1
1156,7094,doordash,719972451,2022-10-23 02:39:44,Dashers don't follow instructions,therefore i will use my 15 credit and cancel my monthly service,1
1156,7095,doordash,719972451,2022-10-23 02:39:44,Dashers don't follow instructions,meanwhile my bank makes interest on my 30 bucks for a week and i am out gas money,1
1156,7096,doordash,719972451,2022-10-23 02:39:44,Dashers don't follow instructions,there goes the ease of using an app,1
1156,7097,doordash,719972451,2022-10-23 02:39:44,Dashers don't follow instructions,go with uber eats instead,1
1157,7098,doordash,719972451,2022-10-24 23:28:59,They canceled my order,should be 0 stars,1
1157,7099,doordash,719972451,2022-10-24 23:28:59,They canceled my order,i placed an order and did not receive my food,1
1157,7100,doordash,719972451,2022-10-24 23:28:59,They canceled my order,door dash cs said they could not credit my account since i used the restaurant app,1
1157,7101,doordash,719972451,2022-10-24 23:28:59,They canceled my order,the restaurant told me the same so i was without my money and my lunch,1
1157,7102,doordash,719972451,2022-10-24 23:28:59,They canceled my order,3 of their dashers were in the restaurant but the restaurant manager stated they told him the order was canceled so they would not take it,1
1157,7103,doordash,719972451,2022-10-24 23:28:59,They canceled my order,my app showed 3 different dashers were on their way,1
1157,7104,doordash,719972451,2022-10-24 23:28:59,They canceled my order,i spoke to doordash cs twice and requested a manager and was told one would call me but if course no one called,1
1157,7105,doordash,719972451,2022-10-24 23:28:59,They canceled my order,both times i was put on hold only to be told my order was on the way,1
1157,7106,doordash,719972451,2022-10-24 23:28:59,They canceled my order,when i told them no one was bringing the order they did not care to help or give a resolution for their mistake,1
1157,7107,doordash,719972451,2022-10-24 23:28:59,They canceled my order,2 12 hours later the restaurant credited my account and still no call from doordash,1
1157,7108,doordash,719972451,2022-10-24 23:28:59,They canceled my order,this was the second time i did not get my order from doordash and did not get help so i decided to write a review,1
1157,7109,doordash,719972451,2022-10-24 23:28:59,They canceled my order,they are unorganized and the cs is worthless in giving any resolution to a serious issuemoney out of my account and nothing to show for it you are just left with an oh well attitude that their customers are ripped off,1
1158,7110,doordash,719972451,2022-12-17 00:03:14,Service,service and times are mediocre the tip is being billed before the service is complete which equals a fact that we cannot tip accordingly especially  to level of service received,3
1158,7111,doordash,719972451,2022-12-17 00:03:14,Service,this makes tipping a good faith thing,3
1158,7112,doordash,719972451,2022-12-17 00:03:14,Service,you do not understand how many times i wished i could have lowered the tip because the delivery quality or time sucked,3
1158,7113,doordash,719972451,2022-12-17 00:03:14,Service,which is totally the reason why i do not use this or any service often anymore,3
1158,7114,doordash,719972451,2022-12-17 00:03:14,Service,so why pay for dash pass,3
1158,7115,doordash,719972451,2022-12-17 00:03:14,Service,that would not be fiscally unreasonable,3
1158,7116,doordash,719972451,2022-12-17 00:03:14,Service,doordash inc is not as great as the big headed company thinks it is,3
1158,7117,doordash,719972451,2022-12-17 00:03:14,Service,it promotes customers to be lazy and wasteful,3
1158,7118,doordash,719972451,2022-12-17 00:03:14,Service,over ordering is also too common,3
1158,7119,doordash,719972451,2022-12-17 00:03:14,Service,we all need to stop looking for easy buttons and paying a premium for lackluster service,3
1158,7120,doordash,719972451,2022-12-17 00:03:14,Service,i would rather just take the family to the diner anymore at least there i have a face to face level of service and workers are much more inclined to feel guilty when they neglect a paying customer,3
1158,7121,doordash,719972451,2022-12-17 00:03:14,Service,and i can always promote or warn the management of there representatives in person,3
1159,7122,doordash,719972451,2022-10-31 02:50:30,Stole my money,so i paid for the yearly doordash pass back in february throughout the couple of months i have had a few times where my order did not show up or they bought me the wrong order not that many times but less than less than 10 more than four i made an order today at mcdonalds it came to 30 more i only received my fries and a drink they forgot the other bag i was told they could not give me a refund becauseit was too many things that went wrong on my account so it does not matter if it is their fault that they gave you the wrong order and you have pictures of receipts and everything if you complain about not receiving what you have paid for they say you have had too many unsatisfactory transactions and say sorry but we are keeping your money even though you did not receive your goods they stole my money and will not give it back to me in credits or anything i cancel this account i would not suggest anybody spend any money with these fees what they are doing is illegal and i am currently talking to my friend who is a civil rights activist because i want to place a class action lawsuit,1
1160,7123,doordash,719972451,2022-11-13 23:55:05,Poor Service and Crooks.  Grubhub is much better!,first of all i never write reviews so this is a first time for me which shows how bad of an experience this was,1
1160,7124,doordash,719972451,2022-11-13 23:55:05,Poor Service and Crooks.  Grubhub is much better!,i placed an order and had specific instructions to leave an ingredient out of my dish,1
1160,7125,doordash,719972451,2022-11-13 23:55:05,Poor Service and Crooks.  Grubhub is much better!,the restaurant added the ingredient anyway which i understand can happen at times,1
1160,7126,doordash,719972451,2022-11-13 23:55:05,Poor Service and Crooks.  Grubhub is much better!,so i contacted doordash about the issue and the mistake on the stores end,1
1160,7127,doordash,719972451,2022-11-13 23:55:05,Poor Service and Crooks.  Grubhub is much better!,the doordash agent told me i could not get a full refund even though i was not at fault,1
1160,7128,doordash,719972451,2022-11-13 23:55:05,Poor Service and Crooks.  Grubhub is much better!,after frustratingly going back and forth as to why i could not get a full refund for the stores mistake i agreed to get paid back to my card,1
1160,7129,doordash,719972451,2022-11-13 23:55:05,Poor Service and Crooks.  Grubhub is much better!,doordash issued me credits instead and after i contacted them about their mistake they said there was nothing they could do and i even had an agent disconnect on me mid chat,1
1160,7130,doordash,719972451,2022-11-13 23:55:05,Poor Service and Crooks.  Grubhub is much better!,i have screenshots and am tempted to take legal action but i do not want anything to do with the sorry excuse for a company,1
1160,7131,doordash,719972451,2022-11-13 23:55:05,Poor Service and Crooks.  Grubhub is much better!,i have never had a problem with grubhub and if there is an issue they are more than willing to help you out with no issues on their end also the double dash feature does not always work,1
1161,7132,doordash,719972451,2022-09-29 15:16:08,Poor dashers and customer service,i just downloaded doordash and began using it a couple of weeks ago,2
1161,7133,doordash,719972451,2022-09-29 15:16:08,Poor dashers and customer service,my first experience was abysmal,2
1161,7134,doordash,719972451,2022-09-29 15:16:08,Poor dashers and customer service,the doordash took my food for herself and claimed to have given it to a valet,2
1161,7135,doordash,719972451,2022-09-29 15:16:08,Poor dashers and customer service,only thing is my building does not have valet,2
1161,7136,doordash,719972451,2022-09-29 15:16:08,Poor dashers and customer service,then when i asked her to come back to show me who she claimed to be far out of the area it was only one minute afteryou guys did re deliver quickly so i decided to move forwardi then ordered late last night after work,2
1161,7137,doordash,719972451,2022-09-29 15:16:08,Poor dashers and customer service,after the first dasher dropped off the second one kayla was at the locationi called her and heard the lady at the drive thru window confirming my order over the loud speaker,2
1161,7138,doordash,719972451,2022-09-29 15:16:08,Poor dashers and customer service,then she hung up,2
1161,7139,doordash,719972451,2022-09-29 15:16:08,Poor dashers and customer service,so i am assuming that she took the order for herself,2
1161,7140,doordash,719972451,2022-09-29 15:16:08,Poor dashers and customer service,after that hour or so ordeal,2
1161,7141,doordash,719972451,2022-09-29 15:16:08,Poor dashers and customer service,i then spend another 40 mins trying to get a resolution from cs,2
1161,7142,doordash,719972451,2022-09-29 15:16:08,Poor dashers and customer service,i simply asked for a timely return of my funds and additional compensation in the form of credit for the last two horrible experiences,2
1161,7143,doordash,719972451,2022-09-29 15:16:08,Poor dashers and customer service,i am not fully aware of the policy but just saying well we returned your money does not seem to suffice,2
1162,7144,doordash,719972451,2022-12-17 17:07:31,"Double order by Technical Issue, handled as Intentional Deception",when i placed my order through the chic fil a app it routed me to finish the order through doordash,1
1162,7145,doordash,719972451,2022-12-17 17:07:31,"Double order by Technical Issue, handled as Intentional Deception",i did not get a confirmation or anything for 10 mins and i went back to submit my order and it said my cart is stale i thought the order never went through since it still had my cart full,1
1162,7146,doordash,719972451,2022-12-17 17:07:31,"Double order by Technical Issue, handled as Intentional Deception",since a reasonable amount of time passed i opened the doordash app and the order did not show for me there either so i went ahead and ordered again thinking it was my first time ordering,1
1162,7147,doordash,719972451,2022-12-17 17:07:31,"Double order by Technical Issue, handled as Intentional Deception",when i placed the second order some time passed before i got the text for the original order and thought it meant my second order to me being the first was being made,1
1162,7148,doordash,719972451,2022-12-17 17:07:31,"Double order by Technical Issue, handled as Intentional Deception",i opened the app and it showed just one order,1
1162,7149,doordash,719972451,2022-12-17 17:07:31,"Double order by Technical Issue, handled as Intentional Deception",a few minutes passed from that and the food arrives,1
1162,7150,doordash,719972451,2022-12-17 17:07:31,"Double order by Technical Issue, handled as Intentional Deception",i then get a text that another is on the way,1
1162,7151,doordash,719972451,2022-12-17 17:07:31,"Double order by Technical Issue, handled as Intentional Deception",i did not intentionally spend more than 110 on chick fil a and their support acknowledged they were having technical issues and had me pound sand anyways,1
1162,7152,doordash,719972451,2022-12-17 17:07:31,"Double order by Technical Issue, handled as Intentional Deception",i will stick with a different service  they have lost my business,1
1163,7153,doordash,719972451,2022-11-27 21:34:42,Worst company,do not drive for these people being paid the bare minimum for orders is insane,1
1163,7154,doordash,719972451,2022-11-27 21:34:42,Worst company,not only that i have requested my account to be deactivated due to the fact that the entire customer service is full of idiots,1
1163,7155,doordash,719972451,2022-11-27 21:34:42,Worst company,i turned the app on mind you i have 200 completed orders for them,1
1163,7156,doordash,719972451,2022-11-27 21:34:42,Worst company,i pull up to a place that does not have any of the customers items so i requested it be canceled saying popeyes is out of the order the girl in the chat canceled the next order i accepted in stead,1
1163,7157,doordash,719972451,2022-11-27 21:34:42,Worst company,so now a customer is upset with her order canceled for no reason and the one i needed canceled was still there after being told i wuld be compensated for the one she mistakenly canceled i realized that compensation was not there called them and wen i tell you they cannot comprehend a single thing in life,1
1163,7159,doordash,719972451,2022-11-27 21:34:42,Worst company,u will have to fight them for your money just to be told they not paying you then why was i told by two different reps i should be receiving payment i did not make them tell me this nor did i ask for these orders to be canceled incorrectly now i have wasted my gas and time,1
1163,7160,doordash,719972451,2022-11-27 21:34:42,Worst company,thank god for uber eats and grub hub,1
1163,7161,doordash,719972451,2022-11-27 21:34:42,Worst company,because this app is the lowest,1
1164,7164,doordash,719972451,2022-11-09 01:40:23,Disappointing end to a year of subscribing,i have been using dashpass for a year now in the past even though orders would get messed up doordash did help a lot,1
1164,7165,doordash,719972451,2022-11-09 01:40:23,Disappointing end to a year of subscribing,but ever since i moved to a new area the prices and delivery fees went up even after 12,1
1164,7166,doordash,719972451,2022-11-09 01:40:23,Disappointing end to a year of subscribing,i use the app because i am a full time student and working in between,1
1164,7167,doordash,719972451,2022-11-09 01:40:23,Disappointing end to a year of subscribing,now i have to pay even more and recently multiple orders have been bad or completely missing multiple items,1
1164,7168,doordash,719972451,2022-11-09 01:40:23,Disappointing end to a year of subscribing,today i hade ordered a meal and a large drink that happened to also be 3 dollars on its own,1
1164,7169,doordash,719972451,2022-11-09 01:40:23,Disappointing end to a year of subscribing,while i was fine with that the order came in and it was missing half the items including that 3 dollar drink,1
1164,7170,doordash,719972451,2022-11-09 01:40:23,Disappointing end to a year of subscribing,when i went to the help area again this time the app just flat out told me it could not help me with refunds and to have a nice day,1
1164,7171,doordash,719972451,2022-11-09 01:40:23,Disappointing end to a year of subscribing,the app is not worth it anymore,1
1164,7172,doordash,719972451,2022-11-09 01:40:23,Disappointing end to a year of subscribing,ubereats has restaurants in my area with less fees even without the pass,1
1164,7173,doordash,719972451,2022-11-09 01:40:23,Disappointing end to a year of subscribing,in the end i have canceled my subscription and deleted the app i would rather just put up with ramen noodles for quick meals instead of being charged all this time for a pass that did not do much for me eventually,1
1165,7174,doordash,719972451,2022-10-11 17:07:13,To many issues,it seems like every other order of not more are arriving 30 min late missing items dropped off at the wrong location sometimes my food never arrives,1
1165,7175,doordash,719972451,2022-10-11 17:07:13,To many issues,the best one to see is the dasher is having car issues i have canceled my dash pass several times now just to use uber eats and go right back to door dash,1
1165,7176,doordash,719972451,2022-10-11 17:07:13,To many issues,uber eats is super expensive even with their subscription,1
1165,7177,doordash,719972451,2022-10-11 17:07:13,To many issues,but door dash is the most unreliable service i have used in my life,1

1165,7179,doordash,719972451,2022-10-11 17:07:13,To many issues,they also picked up my food by the time they stop,1
1165,7180,doordash,719972451,2022-10-11 17:07:13,To many issues,the support person was the least charismatic person i have meet telling me their insuring my food would not be cold and it would arrive soon,1
1165,7181,doordash,719972451,2022-10-11 17:07:13,To many issues,then they just stop the chat out of nowhere the food was cold and it took a hour an 30 min when it was expected to take 25 min,1
1165,7182,doordash,719972451,2022-10-11 17:07:13,To many issues,i have spent thousands on door dash in a few years and nothing gets fixed you might get some credits but not your food,1

1168,7206,doordash,719972451,2022-12-14 06:17:54,Shocked at the lack of customer support…,99 of the time these orders roll off without a hitch,2
1168,7207,doordash,719972451,2022-12-14 06:17:54,Shocked at the lack of customer support…,the one time i have a missing item the response is shocking and just plain saddoordash has quite an impressive what went wrong,2
1168,7208,doordash,719972451,2022-12-14 06:17:54,Shocked at the lack of customer support…,response platform for their customers,2
1168,7209,doordash,719972451,2022-12-14 06:17:54,Shocked at the lack of customer support…,but what good is it whenever the app then states it is refusal to issue a credit for any order error,2

1168,7213,doordash,719972451,2022-12-14 06:17:54,Shocked at the lack of customer support…,very odd and quite frankly a bit jarring type of response,2
1168,7214,doordash,719972451,2022-12-14 06:17:54,Shocked at the lack of customer support…,i am totally shocked,2
1168,7215,doordash,719972451,2022-12-14 06:17:54,Shocked at the lack of customer support…,my familys restaurant would never do that to a customer it is disparaging to see this large corporation integrate this into their business,2
1168,7216,doordash,719972451,2022-12-14 06:17:54,Shocked at the lack of customer support…,please do better doordash,2
1169,7217,doordash,719972451,2022-12-20 22:00:21,Always. Wrong.,wish i could give 0 stars,1
1169,7218,doordash,719972451,2022-12-20 22:00:21,Always. Wrong.,i have had basically every order wrong since using this platform,1
1169,7219,doordash,719972451,2022-12-20 22:00:21,Always. Wrong.,at the beginning they give a credit,1
1169,7220,doordash,719972451,2022-12-20 22:00:21,Always. Wrong.,but it is never actually even close to the original purchase amount,1
1169,7221,doordash,719972451,2022-12-20 22:00:21,Always. Wrong.,3 here maybe 6 there,1
1169,7222,doordash,719972451,2022-12-20 22:00:21,Always. Wrong.,then i had literally back to back orders wrong,1
1169,7223,doordash,719972451,2022-12-20 22:00:21,Always. Wrong.,and when i say wrong i mean completely missing items,1
1169,7224,doordash,719972451,2022-12-20 22:00:21,Always. Wrong.,even one time there was complete proof because the delivery driver messaged that the place was out of what i ordered,1
1169,7225,doordash,719972451,2022-12-20 22:00:21,Always. Wrong.,door dash refused to compensate,1
1169,7226,doordash,719972451,2022-12-20 22:00:21,Always. Wrong.,i never asked for any extra just the money i had spent on items i did not ever get,1
1169,7227,doordash,719972451,2022-12-20 22:00:21,Always. Wrong.,i am furious that i have over 30  wasted on items i never even got,1
1169,7228,doordash,719972451,2022-12-20 22:00:21,Always. Wrong.,when you contact support the first message always seems like they will be so helpful but it is downhill from there,1
1169,7229,doordash,719972451,2022-12-20 22:00:21,Always. Wrong.,they are rude unhelpful and sometimes just completely end the conversation by disconnecting,1
1169,7230,doordash,719972451,2022-12-20 22:00:21,Always. Wrong.,they always say they will follow up through email and then never do,1
1169,7231,doordash,719972451,2022-12-20 22:00:21,Always. Wrong.,i will never use doordash again,1
1169,7233,doordash,719972451,2022-12-20 22:00:21,Always. Wrong.,at this point it is theft,1
1169,7234,doordash,719972451,2022-12-20 22:00:21,Always. Wrong.,they have stolen from me,1
1169,7235,doordash,719972451,2022-12-20 22:00:21,Always. Wrong.,money that i work hard for,1
1169,7236,doordash,719972451,2022-12-20 22:00:21,Always. Wrong.,it is ridiculous,1
1170,7237,doordash,719972451,2022-10-08 19:52:28,Dasher issues,unfortunately i was unable to continue using doordash because apparently when you have a dasher driver account and  a personal doordash ordering app under the same email issues can arise,1
1170,7238,doordash,719972451,2022-10-08 19:52:28,Dasher issues,i decided to take the doordash ordering app off my phone because now i want to cook more,1
1170,7239,doordash,719972451,2022-10-08 19:52:28,Dasher issues,due to me deactivating my personal doordash ordering app it ended up kicking me out of my dasher driver account,1
1170,7240,doordash,719972451,2022-10-08 19:52:28,Dasher issues,i called support and they confirmed that the issue was connecting one email to both accounts,1
1170,7241,doordash,719972451,2022-10-08 19:52:28,Dasher issues,where it went wrong was when i was assured that both accounts could be separated and that it would take 2448 hrs,1
1170,7242,doordash,719972451,2022-10-08 19:52:28,Dasher issues,i let over 48 hrs pass after many log in attempts throughout the day,1
1170,7243,doordash,719972451,2022-10-08 19:52:28,Dasher issues,i called support again today and support then tells me that it is not possible to separate my accounts without reactivating the personal account and changing my email and i think thats unfair that i had to call and find that out,1
1170,7244,doordash,719972451,2022-10-08 19:52:28,Dasher issues,on top of the the support person i spoke also let m know that my request to separate my accounts was never possible so why assure me that it was,1
1170,7245,doordash,719972451,2022-10-08 19:52:28,Dasher issues,that did it for me,1
1171,7246,doordash,719972451,2022-12-12 01:13:44,Amazing Customer Service,i have tried a lot of food delivery apps over the years,5
1171,7247,doordash,719972451,2022-12-12 01:13:44,Amazing Customer Service,they are all basically the same in my opinion but the reason i prefer doordash over any other is because of the customer service,5
1171,7248,doordash,719972451,2022-12-12 01:13:44,Amazing Customer Service,sometimes issues happen with the food or the person delivering the food,5
1171,7249,doordash,719972451,2022-12-12 01:13:44,Amazing Customer Service,that happens with every food delivery service,5
1171,7250,doordash,719972451,2022-12-12 01:13:44,Amazing Customer Service,but the difference is that every time i have asked for customer service help from doordash i am always connected to a real person who is actually perfectly reasonable and extremely helpful about what they can do to make things right for me,5
1171,7251,doordash,719972451,2022-12-12 01:13:44,Amazing Customer Service,also the help button is very easy to find,5
1171,7252,doordash,719972451,2022-12-12 01:13:44,Amazing Customer Service,i have found that most other apps try to hide it from you and even when you do find it you just end up talking to a robot then maybe getting a small refund,5
1172,7253,doordash,719972451,2022-10-28 21:24:35,!!,i have been using door dash for a while now and i have also had multiple problems with it i have tried to cancel and get my money back instead of credits because i do not want that,2

1173,7261,doordash,719972451,2022-12-20 03:20:30,Just wanted my Cheetos,i went in to order 2 bags of flamin hot lime cheetos and put in a few other bags of chips for my family,1
1173,7262,doordash,719972451,2022-12-20 03:20:30,Just wanted my Cheetos,i was only informed after ordering that the store did not in fact have the chips i wanted,1
1173,7263,doordash,719972451,2022-12-20 03:20:30,Just wanted my Cheetos,fine whatever,1
1173,7264,doordash,719972451,2022-12-20 03:20:30,Just wanted my Cheetos,even though it is the only reason i even ordered,1
1173,7265,doordash,719972451,2022-12-20 03:20:30,Just wanted my Cheetos,the dasher also cannot find one of the other chips and i have to literally guide him to where they are via text,1
1173,7266,doordash,719972451,2022-12-20 03:20:30,Just wanted my Cheetos,then he finds that there is only a bigger more expensive version that i then have to pay more for,1
1173,7267,doordash,719972451,2022-12-20 03:20:30,Just wanted my Cheetos,then they mess up the last bag of chips getting the wrong kind therefor rendering them useless as nobody in my house even likes that kind,1
1173,7268,doordash,719972451,2022-12-20 03:20:30,Just wanted my Cheetos,i am fed up by this point and look to customer service to see if i can at least get some compensation for the bag of chips that was wrong only to find that i do not talk to a real person and the robot tells me how i unfortunately cannot receive a refund or in store credit due to our new policy so i have spent over twenty dollars with a bag of chips to show for it,1
1173,7269,doordash,719972451,2022-12-20 03:20:30,Just wanted my Cheetos,thanks doordash,1
1173,7270,doordash,719972451,2022-12-20 03:20:30,Just wanted my Cheetos,i am never using you again,1
1174,7271,doordash,719972451,2022-11-07 23:28:11,DoorDash order,i cannot believe i have to write this review today on november 7th around 300 i had a door dasher named cristian,1
1174,7272,doordash,719972451,2022-11-07 23:28:11,DoorDash order,at my job we always order food to our work and today i decided to order food cristian could not follow simple signs where they point where the entrance is instead he wants me to go out of my way to door he is at,1
1174,7273,doordash,719972451,2022-11-07 23:28:11,DoorDash order,i told him i simply cannot because i am working,1
1174,7274,doordash,719972451,2022-11-07 23:28:11,DoorDash order,at the entrance there is always workers that will receive the food for me,1
1174,7275,doordash,719972451,2022-11-07 23:28:11,DoorDash order,so instead he told me i am wasting his time and just left it at a door on some mud,1
1174,7276,doordash,719972451,2022-11-07 23:28:11,DoorDash order,when i finally had time to go the door he left it at i had to take the food out the bag but when i opened the bag my soup was spilled all over my food so i could not even eat it anymore,1
1174,7277,doordash,719972451,2022-11-07 23:28:11,DoorDash order,im glad i was able to get a some what refund but that would never make up the experience i just had i smell like the soup and covered in it and now i have to wait to get home to eat because i do not ever want to order food on these apps again,1
1174,7278,doordash,719972451,2022-11-07 23:28:11,DoorDash order,would be careful because when things happen like this all they can do is apologize,1
1175,7279,doordash,719972451,2022-09-16 18:31:53,Garbage customer support,while the app itself is functional the user interface was designed by an idiot,2
1175,7280,doordash,719972451,2022-09-16 18:31:53,Garbage customer support,no way to clear cart without manually deleting each item,2
1175,7281,doordash,719972451,2022-09-16 18:31:53,Garbage customer support,even force closing the app and logging out will not do itno way to leave support chat screen with the chat still openneed help with current order just defaults to selecting a past orderapp repeatedly asks and fails to verify my cardnow for my experience with customer support,2
1175,7282,doordash,719972451,2022-09-16 18:31:53,Garbage customer support,during my first attempt i was connected to someone named deepak who clearly was not paying attention to my problem as his first 3 suggestions were all negated by my initial description of the problem,2
1175,7283,doordash,719972451,2022-09-16 18:31:53,Garbage customer support,after accidentally leaving the chat with no way to return due to the aforementioned design flaws made by an idioti attempted a second chat with customer support with someone named megha,2
1175,7284,doordash,719972451,2022-09-16 18:31:53,Garbage customer support,i assume meghan did not fit but then again deepak fits so who knows,2
1175,7285,doordash,719972451,2022-09-16 18:31:53,Garbage customer support,regardless they clearly were not paying attention either because their first suggestion was that i try using the app instead of the desktop site even though i clearly just said that my problem was in the app and that the app will only ask to scan the card for verification when i specifically said that was the part that does not work,2
1175,7286,doordash,719972451,2022-09-16 18:31:53,Garbage customer support,and then they gave up and sent me a troubleshooting email so i can fix their poorly designed apparently buggy software myself,2
1175,7287,doordash,719972451,2022-09-16 18:31:53,Garbage customer support,i am deeply unimpressed,2
1176,7288,doordash,719972451,2022-12-16 19:07:11,Service has deteriorated,i watch my driver on the app,3
1176,7289,doordash,719972451,2022-12-16 19:07:11,Service has deteriorated,it is obvious that several orders are being delivered at once,3
1176,7290,doordash,719972451,2022-12-16 19:07:11,Service has deteriorated,because of where i am located i am always last in line,3
1176,7291,doordash,719972451,2022-12-16 19:07:11,Service has deteriorated,by the time my food arrives the things that are supposed to be hot are cold and the things that are supposed to be cold or frozen are warm or melting,3
1176,7292,doordash,719972451,2022-12-16 19:07:11,Service has deteriorated,when a special deal is offered and i meet the criteria for the deal i am still not able to actually get the deal,3
1176,7293,doordash,719972451,2022-12-16 19:07:11,Service has deteriorated,and all the fees and prices have gone up so much i often cancel out an order when i see the final total,3
1176,7294,doordash,719972451,2022-12-16 19:07:11,Service has deteriorated,this is true even with subscribing to the no delivery fee service,3
1176,7295,doordash,719972451,2022-12-16 19:07:11,Service has deteriorated,when the tip is figured i do not know what total they are basing it on,3
1176,7296,doordash,719972451,2022-12-16 19:07:11,Service has deteriorated,for a 24 order the 20 tip was 650,3
1176,7297,doordash,719972451,2022-12-16 19:07:11,Service has deteriorated,when they make a mistake or fail to deliver what has been ordered they give you 5 back even when your expense has been much more than that and someone in your party did not get their food,3
1177,7298,doordash,719972451,2022-11-17 19:50:50,So unprofessional,there was a print that said if i added the dash pass to my order i could save a little over 4 so i did,1
1177,7299,doordash,719972451,2022-11-17 19:50:50,So unprofessional,it also said that i would get a 30 day free trial and at the end of the 0 days i would be charged 999 per month,1
1177,7300,doordash,719972451,2022-11-17 19:50:50,So unprofessional,when i placed my order nothing was deducted from the total so i contacted customer supportthe guy who helped me did not know how to speak english well had a lot of spelling and grammatical errors and just represented himself and the company very poorly due to the above and his overall tone,1
1177,7301,doordash,719972451,2022-11-17 19:50:50,So unprofessional,i was honestly shocked,1
1177,7302,doordash,719972451,2022-11-17 19:50:50,So unprofessional,he decided to call me because he could not understand me so when we spoke i reiterated everything that had happened to which he told me he refunded me some money and canceled my dash pass,1
1177,7303,doordash,719972451,2022-11-17 19:50:50,So unprofessional,i check my account a few days later to see not only no refund but also a 999 charge for the dash pass,1
1177,7304,doordash,719972451,2022-11-17 19:50:50,So unprofessional,needless to say i have deleted their app and will save myself a lot of money by going to get my food myself,1
1177,7305,doordash,719972451,2022-11-17 19:50:50,So unprofessional,these companies do not care about us they only care about what they can get away with,1
1178,7306,doordash,719972451,2022-10-29 19:48:07,Yikes,i have used doordash almost daily for lunch at work for about two months,1
1178,7307,doordash,719972451,2022-10-29 19:48:07,Yikes,really enjoyed the service dashers are accommodating very convenienti would say maybe 1 in every 5 orders has either a missing or incorrect itemno big deal,1
1178,7308,doordash,719972451,2022-10-29 19:48:07,Yikes,these little mistakes happen all the time when you go to a restauranthowever apparently after a few orders with missing items they stop refunding for the missing itemsand support chat will just keep disconnecting you before you can figure out what is going on,1
1178,7309,doordash,719972451,2022-10-29 19:48:07,Yikes,i do not mind the little mistakes on orders they are most likely not dds fault,1
1178,7310,doordash,719972451,2022-10-29 19:48:07,Yikes,but support trying to shrug me off so that they do not have to tell me i am not getting a refund for food i paid for but did not receive was infuriating,1
1178,7311,doordash,719972451,2022-10-29 19:48:07,Yikes,i think i went through 8 different representatives before we got to our conclusion,1
1178,7312,doordash,719972451,2022-10-29 19:48:07,Yikes,and for the record i was not swearing or harassing nothing like that just patiently trying to figure out what was going onhey i wish that my orders were not frequently missing items too,1
1178,7313,doordash,719972451,2022-10-29 19:48:07,Yikes,but cutting me off from being refunded for incorrect orders without an option for appeal or to provide picturesanythingthat is unacceptable,1
1178,7314,doordash,719972451,2022-10-29 19:48:07,Yikes,like half my order was not in the bag this timei am not here to donate to doordash i am paying for a service,1
1178,7315,doordash,719972451,2022-10-29 19:48:07,Yikes,if that service is not provided and i still have to pay i am deleting the appit is too bad too this was a nifty service,1
1178,7316,doordash,719972451,2022-10-29 19:48:07,Yikes,but bad policies like this are enough for me to just go drive around the block to get my own food,1
1179,7317,doordash,719972451,2022-10-25 01:25:00,Shady and unethical,used doordash and paid for their dash pass for close to 2 years used serval times a week,1
1179,7318,doordash,719972451,2022-10-25 01:25:00,Shady and unethical,recently made an order that they charged me 25 more for the food items than what was actually charged on the receipt from the restaurant,1
1179,7319,doordash,719972451,2022-10-25 01:25:00,Shady and unethical,attempted to find a resolution from their customer service which was met with hostile and unnecessary aggression,1
1179,7320,doordash,719972451,2022-10-25 01:25:00,Shady and unethical,they transferred me 4 different times to different experts who requested full card information,1
1179,7321,doordash,719972451,2022-10-25 01:25:00,Shady and unethical,explained this was not secure and was unnecessary considering the documentation i had,1
1179,7322,doordash,719972451,2022-10-25 01:25:00,Shady and unethical,after becoming frustrated in told them if they would like to keep my business they could call me which never happened,1
1179,7323,doordash,719972451,2022-10-25 01:25:00,Shady and unethical,today the card authorization was completed and the charge was not adjusted,1
1179,7324,doordash,719972451,2022-10-25 01:25:00,Shady and unethical,i have no way verify if other orders i have placed in the past had this same issue but i refuse to be taken advantaged of again like this,1
1179,7325,doordash,719972451,2022-10-25 01:25:00,Shady and unethical,i have deleted me account and will not use their services again which seems to be the resolution they wanted since no attempt to contact me was made at all,1
1180,7326,doordash,719972451,2022-11-06 11:56:06,"As It's Grown, It's Gotten Hard to Navigate",this app used to be great and i am sure its great for a lot of people that you can order from grocery stores gas stations liquor stores etc but now i have got to scroll through 50 a list that is forever long that has one local restaurant for ever 10 things that are not a restaurant and there is no easy way to filter it out unless you filter for a particular type of food,3
1180,7327,doordash,719972451,2022-11-06 11:56:06,"As It's Grown, It's Gotten Hard to Navigate",they should take a page from uber eats book and put buttons at the top that will filter for just restaurants,3
1180,7328,doordash,719972451,2022-11-06 11:56:06,"As It's Grown, It's Gotten Hard to Navigate",they also need to figure out a way to limit how many different stores a single store can list,3
1180,7329,doordash,719972451,2022-11-06 11:56:06,"As It's Grown, It's Gotten Hard to Navigate",for example meijer has one for their main store then another store just for meijer liquor then another store for meijer pet and all three pickup at the same location,3
1180,7330,doordash,719972451,2022-11-06 11:56:06,"As It's Grown, It's Gotten Hard to Navigate",they could and should consolidate that and that would be a few less things you had have to scroll through,3
1181,7331,doordash,719972451,2022-09-21 15:42:02,Unreliable Dashers,doordash is great when placing your order thru the app,1
1181,7332,doordash,719972451,2022-09-21 15:42:02,Unreliable Dashers,however when it comes to actually receiving your order i would rate a 5 if i could,1
1181,7333,doordash,719972451,2022-09-21 15:42:02,Unreliable Dashers,it is a continuous cycle of my wife and i placing orders and the dasher never delivers to our home,1
1181,7334,doordash,719972451,2022-09-21 15:42:02,Unreliable Dashers,they always drop our order off to another house,1
1181,7335,doordash,719972451,2022-09-21 15:42:02,Unreliable Dashers,we have been fortunate enough to walk as far as 4 streets over just looking for our order and finding it but even calling and messaging our dasher to tell them per the app you are not even on our street is brutal as the dashers ignore all communication efforts,1
1181,7336,doordash,719972451,2022-09-21 15:42:02,Unreliable Dashers,smh if the dashers are not using gps to make their deliveries then doordash should find a more productive method to screening dashers and making sure they know how to read addresses,1
1181,7337,doordash,719972451,2022-09-21 15:42:02,Unreliable Dashers,what is worse is that this occurs so much with our orders sometimes doordash refuses to give us a refund of our order because we have had submitted too many issues with our orders not being delivered,1
1181,7338,doordash,719972451,2022-09-21 15:42:02,Unreliable Dashers,doordash definitely needs to audit themselves and their dashers and restaurant accuracy of fulfilling orders,1
1182,7339,doordash,719972451,2022-11-07 03:17:29,"DRIVERS STEAL, DOORDASH REFUSES TO COVER",i have had hundreds of dollars stolen from me from either the dashers or the company many times i have no issues but on the off chances that i do they say they see everything on a case by case basis and if that was true would not a dasher literally stealing your order warrant a refund in some way,1
1182,7340,doordash,719972451,2022-11-07 03:17:29,"DRIVERS STEAL, DOORDASH REFUSES TO COVER",doordash does not seem to think so,1
1182,7341,doordash,719972451,2022-11-07 03:17:29,"DRIVERS STEAL, DOORDASH REFUSES TO COVER",they seem to think it is not their fault or their drivers fault when you can literally watch the dasher drive to you,1
1182,7342,doordash,719972451,2022-11-07 03:17:29,"DRIVERS STEAL, DOORDASH REFUSES TO COVER",said dasher that stole our order claimed he was across the street when in the app he was 3 streets down and completed the order then proceeded to lie to us saying that we came out and signed for it when we were outside for 10 minutes and no cars came into our complex,1
1182,7343,doordash,719972451,2022-11-07 03:17:29,"DRIVERS STEAL, DOORDASH REFUSES TO COVER",and that is not the first time,1
1182,7344,doordash,719972451,2022-11-07 03:17:29,"DRIVERS STEAL, DOORDASH REFUSES TO COVER",i swear the hire the most brain dead mouth breathing idiots to deliver for them the drivers cannot follow simple instructions half the time when there not stealing your order,1
1182,7345,doordash,719972451,2022-11-07 03:17:29,"DRIVERS STEAL, DOORDASH REFUSES TO COVER",no other delivery app has given me this much trouble or stolen this much money from me and my kids,1
1183,7347,doordash,719972451,2022-11-22 22:57:08,"Great app, one significant complaint.",why cannot i rate my restaurant and driver outside of the pop up that disappears from swiping out of the app getting a battery notification etc,3
1183,7348,doordash,719972451,2022-11-22 22:57:08,"Great app, one significant complaint.",if for any reason i am trying to get to another part of the app when the opportunity to rate pops up i am probably going to thoughtlessly tap past it and be left unable to voice my opinion on what i just ate good or bad,3
1183,7349,doordash,719972451,2022-11-22 22:57:08,"Great app, one significant complaint.",this has needlessly soured my mood from not being able to endorse a great meal and feeling some pent up appreciation that has nowhere productive to go,3
1183,7350,doordash,719972451,2022-11-22 22:57:08,"Great app, one significant complaint.",uber let us you increase the tip part way through the delivery,3
1183,7351,doordash,719972451,2022-11-22 22:57:08,"Great app, one significant complaint.",sure it would just add anxiety to feeling like you need to tip more based on how long your order is taking and it is probably good that doordash has ways of differentiating itself from others but that is just another quality of life improvement that feels like it is missing from the app,3
1184,7352,doordash,719972451,2022-09-27 01:00:24,Worst delivery company they hire any driver and don't care if they mess up the order,do not waste your time,1
1184,7353,doordash,719972451,2022-09-27 01:00:24,Worst delivery company they hire any driver and don't care if they mess up the order,i live in an apartment the driver got lost,1

1194,7463,doordash,719972451,2022-10-31 02:03:04,Gambling with your money and food.,since this business hurts restaurants anyway i encourage everyone to avoid using it,1
1195,7464,doordash,719972451,2022-10-19 03:57:06,"Not perfect, and that's okay!!",i love this app,5
1195,7465,doordash,719972451,2022-10-19 03:57:06,"Not perfect, and that's okay!!",i have been using it a lot especially since i am a student who does not have their license,5
1195,7466,doordash,719972451,2022-10-19 03:57:06,"Not perfect, and that's okay!!",most of the time my orders are great and my experience is aswell,5
1195,7467,doordash,719972451,2022-10-19 03:57:06,"Not perfect, and that's okay!!",however sometimes there is mixups like not getting an item you paid for mixing up your order etc,5
1195,7468,doordash,719972451,2022-10-19 03:57:06,"Not perfect, and that's okay!!",it is extremely aggravating but doordash support has always compensated me every time without fail and had amazing customer service while doing so,5
1195,7469,doordash,719972451,2022-10-19 03:57:06,"Not perfect, and that's okay!!",with an app like this it is basically expected there will be some mistakes but doordash takes great pride in fixing the issue,5
1195,7470,doordash,719972451,2022-10-19 03:57:06,"Not perfect, and that's okay!!",i usually never even write reviews but the customer support representative i spoke with was so nice and understand i had to say my piece,5

1196,7472,doordash,719972451,2022-10-03 18:17:25,Dashers Picking Up Multiple Orders,doordash is awesome especially forparents who both work and sometimes just do not have the time or energy to make dinner,4
1196,7473,doordash,719972451,2022-10-03 18:17:25,Dashers Picking Up Multiple Orders,my biggest complaint is that lately dashers have been picking up multiple peoples orders at a time,4
1196,7474,doordash,719972451,2022-10-03 18:17:25,Dashers Picking Up Multiple Orders,when this happens our food gets to us cold because the dasher has driven around to other houses dropping off the other orders,4
1196,7475,doordash,719972451,2022-10-03 18:17:25,Dashers Picking Up Multiple Orders,i understand the concept of efficiency and that they are trying to make the most of their trips,4
1196,7476,doordash,719972451,2022-10-03 18:17:25,Dashers Picking Up Multiple Orders,but it becomes problematic for the food temperature and because the food ordered from doordash is more expensive than ordering pickup from the restaurant app directly it is expected that the orders will come correctly in a timely manner and warm,4
1196,7477,doordash,719972451,2022-10-03 18:17:25,Dashers Picking Up Multiple Orders,other than that we have had pretty good experiences with doordash which is why we did the 4 stars,4
1197,7478,doordash,719972451,2022-11-02 03:11:45,DoorDash is incredible.,when i lost my wife and surrogate children in a house fire following a freak accident involving our dog twelve gallons of motor oil and a poorly knit hanukkah sweater that depicted danny devito passionately kissing abraham on the lips i had no way to cook my own food,5
1197,7479,doordash,719972451,2022-11-02 03:11:45,DoorDash is incredible.,doordash has served as my replacement family for three years now some dashers will roleplay as my wife if i give a big tip and i have since fallen in love with the regular dashers,5
1197,7480,doordash,719972451,2022-11-02 03:11:45,DoorDash is incredible.,now the majority of them are married to me in a polyamorous relationship and we all live in an estate together in the canadian country,5
1197,7481,doordash,719972451,2022-11-02 03:11:45,DoorDash is incredible.,our twelve children are all dashers which is where we obtain our income all those married to me are retired now,5

1198,7496,doordash,719972451,2022-12-14 01:21:20,No refund policy is ruining the app,i have lost more money in the past month on non refunded screwups than i have saved with the fee waivers,1
1198,7497,doordash,719972451,2022-12-14 01:21:20,No refund policy is ruining the app,if you do not want to take responsibility for the restaurants on your platform do not be surprised when you either lose customers or have people continuously making new accounts or finding some other way around this awful new policy,1
1199,7499,doordash,719972451,2022-11-03 02:58:11,So much more expensive than Uber eats (beware)!,it is sad because for years now i have used doordash and paid for dash pass  little did i know that uber eats is still less expensive even when you have dash pass,2
1199,7500,doordash,719972451,2022-11-03 02:58:11,So much more expensive than Uber eats (beware)!,i compared an order from uber eats from the same place and door dash was 7 more expensive that is dash pass versus no membership with uber eats,2
1199,7501,doordash,719972451,2022-11-03 02:58:11,So much more expensive than Uber eats (beware)!,i can only imagine how much more expensive it would have been if i did not have dash pass prob closer to 15 more,2
1199,7502,doordash,719972451,2022-11-03 02:58:11,So much more expensive than Uber eats (beware)!,honestly i feel cheated  additionally even with dash pass you have to pay extra for express delivery meaning they send the delivery driver off in a random direction in the wrong way before delivering to you if you do not pay the feel,2
1199,7503,doordash,719972451,2022-11-03 02:58:11,So much more expensive than Uber eats (beware)!,i have a screenshot of door dash trying to send the driver 15 mins in the wrong direction when i was 3 mins away from the restaurant fortunately the driver called and told me he would bring me my food first,2

1201,7514,doordash,719972451,2022-10-29 01:03:12,Terrible Customer Service,3 orders were delivered successfully but my last order showed delivered but it was not,1
1201,7515,doordash,719972451,2022-10-29 01:03:12,Terrible Customer Service,the dasher took a picture of her car dashboard,1
1201,7516,doordash,719972451,2022-10-29 01:03:12,Terrible Customer Service,i contacted customer service and i thought the issue was resolved when i said i just want another order place,1
1201,7517,doordash,719972451,2022-10-29 01:03:12,Terrible Customer Service,i see where the order was placed but zaxbys told the new dasher steven that two orders was already made and gone mind you i ordered from zaxbys twice and the second one i never received,1
1201,7518,doordash,719972451,2022-10-29 01:03:12,Terrible Customer Service,i contacted customer service again and was told they would give me 25 credit for the inconvenience but i would still receive the food,1
1201,7519,doordash,719972451,2022-10-29 01:03:12,Terrible Customer Service,the dasher then called me and say i have to cancel my order so to make a long story short doordash only gave me 4 because even though the order was canceled due to their error they could not give me my money back,1
1201,7520,doordash,719972451,2022-10-29 01:03:12,Terrible Customer Service,i spend plenty of money with doordash look me up by my name but i promise i will not give another penny to this garbage company,1
1202,7521,doordash,719972451,2022-12-04 13:33:13,THE ABSOLUTE WORST,okay this review is coming from a customer and a merchant point of view,1
1202,7522,doordash,719972451,2022-12-04 13:33:13,THE ABSOLUTE WORST,as a customer i have been screwed over by doordash countless times cold food missing items cancelled order an hour after i placed it etc,1
1202,7523,doordash,719972451,2022-12-04 13:33:13,THE ABSOLUTE WORST,everyone is short staffed i manage a restaurant so if you do not have drivers why are you allowing customers to place orders,1
1202,7524,doordash,719972451,2022-12-04 13:33:13,THE ABSOLUTE WORST,if a customer complains that the food is extremely cold or has a major piece missing why do you think 5 or less credit is suffice,1
1202,7525,doordash,719972451,2022-12-04 13:33:13,THE ABSOLUTE WORST,as a merchant if the first driver cancels after they have already picked it up why not notify the restaurant so we can remake in a timely manner for the next driver and the customer,1
1202,7526,doordash,719972451,2022-12-04 13:33:13,THE ABSOLUTE WORST,also check the attitude of some of your drivers you send them to the restaurant 1015 minutes before the order is scheduled to be picked up and we receive nothing but attitude at the restaurant,1
1202,7527,doordash,719972451,2022-12-04 13:33:13,THE ABSOLUTE WORST,all and all this company needs to reassess how they do business,1
1202,7528,doordash,719972451,2022-12-04 13:33:13,THE ABSOLUTE WORST,i should not be upset as a customer and merchant,1
1203,7529,doordash,719972451,2022-09-25 21:06:28,I got charged for a cancelled order without any reason,i ordered from a restaurant last friday when doordash app said delivery time is 57 mins,1
1203,7530,doordash,719972451,2022-09-25 21:06:28,I got charged for a cancelled order without any reason,but after placing the order delivery time changed to 80 mins which is too long,1
1203,7531,doordash,719972451,2022-09-25 21:06:28,I got charged for a cancelled order without any reason,so within 2 mins i called the restaurant to cancel the order but they cannot do it via doordash,1
1203,7532,doordash,719972451,2022-09-25 21:06:28,I got charged for a cancelled order without any reason,i so contacted doordash agent who helped me cancel the order and also confirmed that the order was cancelled,1
1203,7533,doordash,719972451,2022-09-25 21:06:28,I got charged for a cancelled order without any reason,the restaurant also called me twice to confirm i do not want this order and i want to cancel itbut two hours later doordash app said i was charged and the order was completed,1
1203,7534,doordash,719972451,2022-09-25 21:06:28,I got charged for a cancelled order without any reason,i believe doordash still assigned a dasher to this order and when the dasher showed up in the restaurant heshe asked the restaurant to prepare for this order,1
1203,7535,doordash,719972451,2022-09-25 21:06:28,I got charged for a cancelled order without any reason,i contacted the second doordash agent,1
1203,7536,doordash,719972451,2022-09-25 21:06:28,I got charged for a cancelled order without any reason,the agent confirmed with me that the first agent did help me cancel this order but there are system errors,1
1203,7537,doordash,719972451,2022-09-25 21:06:28,I got charged for a cancelled order without any reason,the agent escalated this issue to their escalation teami waited for more than 24 hours but all i got back from the escalation team is an email written in a standard template by a bot saying that the refund request is not approved by doordashs policyi contacted doordash again,1
1203,7538,doordash,719972451,2022-09-25 21:06:28,I got charged for a cancelled order without any reason,their supervisor just repeated the same thing to me your case has been reviewed by our escalation team and your refund request is not approvedsuper disappointed about doordash,1
1203,7539,doordash,719972451,2022-09-25 21:06:28,I got charged for a cancelled order without any reason,they ask customers to pay for their own system errors,1
1204,7540,doordash,719972451,2022-12-04 02:59:17,Horrible customer service,this company is horrible,1

1204,7543,doordash,719972451,2022-12-04 02:59:17,Horrible customer service,there has been more than one occasion where i ordered food and the driver never delivered it and i called the company and they offered no refund,1
1204,7544,doordash,719972451,2022-12-04 02:59:17,Horrible customer service,i called the restaurant but they said the dasher had picked up the food so they understandably could not do anything,1
1204,7545,doordash,719972451,2022-12-04 02:59:17,Horrible customer service,other times the restaurant got my orders completely wrong,1
1204,7546,doordash,719972451,2022-12-04 02:59:17,Horrible customer service,i specifically star on all my orders if you are out of something or cannot make my order do not substitute call me or at the very least cancel the order,1
1204,7547,doordash,719972451,2022-12-04 02:59:17,Horrible customer service,the restaurant did neither and doordash did not give me a refund,1
1204,7548,doordash,719972451,2022-12-04 02:59:17,Horrible customer service,they did not even give me credit,1
1204,7549,doordash,719972451,2022-12-04 02:59:17,Horrible customer service,and because i have been very ill in 2022 i have not been able to leave home a lot this year so i depended on services like this a lot,1

1206,7560,doordash,719972451,2022-11-19 17:51:39,Always something missing,for a long time this was great but recently 9 times out of 10 my order is missing something,1

1206,7562,doordash,719972451,2022-11-19 17:51:39,Always something missing,and for the first month or so door dash was good about refunding missing items,1
1206,7563,doordash,719972451,2022-11-19 17:51:39,Always something missing,something changed though and now when a 9 item is missing they only offer a 2 door dash credit and recently they cannot even give me that,1

1206,7568,doordash,719972451,2022-11-19 17:51:39,Always something missing,this was great during covid but now i would rather just go pick up my food so i can be sure that i have everything,1
1207,7569,doordash,719972451,2022-11-15 05:10:19,UNPROFESSIONAL AND NOT HELPFUL,i ordered mcdonalds from broadway 1 hour before they closed and they canceled my order 10 minutes after placing my order and taking my money i then called doordash and they told me i will receive a refund 35 business days i then went on to explain to the agent that was my last little bit of money i had to feed my family and that is the only thing i have to feed my family i have two children who are hungry right now i have no car which is why i am using doordash the agent was no help i asked for a supervisor trying to explain my situation he then leaves me on hold for an hour tells me no supervisor is available and continue to give me the run around to speak to a manger i am overly furious about this situation it did not take 35 business days to take my money out my account it should not take 3 days to go back into my account he then go on to try to offer me 10 in doordash credit like that is going to be enough for food,1
1208,7570,doordash,719972451,2022-12-12 21:15:59,Crazy high markups,i used doordash once and took advantage of free delivery for your first order because of their new partnership with chickfila,3
1208,7571,doordash,719972451,2022-12-12 21:15:59,Crazy high markups,i ended up with a 5 credit because my order was an hour late completely wrong and very cold,3
1208,7572,doordash,719972451,2022-12-12 21:15:59,Crazy high markups,in trying to use up my credit i noticed that prices were higher normal,3
1208,7573,doordash,719972451,2022-12-12 21:15:59,Crazy high markups,i opened up my postmates account and noticed that every single item i viewed from multiple restaurants was 13 higher with a higher delivery fee,3
1208,7574,doordash,719972451,2022-12-12 21:15:59,Crazy high markups,in fact the price of the food was more than if i ordered directly from the restaurant,3
1208,7575,doordash,719972451,2022-12-12 21:15:59,Crazy high markups,what a disaster i have not used my 5 credit and am tempted to treat it as a lossthey have the delivery notifications with their ad notifications,3
1208,7576,doordash,719972451,2022-12-12 21:15:59,Crazy high markups,meaning you either receive delivery notifications and updates or you do not to avoid the stupid ads,3
1208,7577,doordash,719972451,2022-12-12 21:15:59,Crazy high markups,we are already using the app,3
1208,7578,doordash,719972451,2022-12-12 21:15:59,Crazy high markups,back off,3
1209,7579,doordash,719972451,2022-12-06 20:30:28,Downfall,honestly i have spent thousands of dollars over several years with this company and they can never get anything right,1
1209,7580,doordash,719972451,2022-12-06 20:30:28,Downfall,it now takes hours for my food to arrive when it used to be fairly reliable and reasonable just about a year ago,1
1209,7581,doordash,719972451,2022-12-06 20:30:28,Downfall,now you have to pay extra on top of paying a dash pass fee to get your food faster,1
1209,7582,doordash,719972451,2022-12-06 20:30:28,Downfall,that is the whole point of a dash pass,1
1209,7583,doordash,719972451,2022-12-06 20:30:28,Downfall,never had to pay that until recently,1
1209,7584,doordash,719972451,2022-12-06 20:30:28,Downfall,i have ordered an hour ahead so it can get here on time when i am taking lunch at work and it still takes them 2 hours to get a dasher to bring my food,1
1209,7585,doordash,719972451,2022-12-06 20:30:28,Downfall,maybe doordash should pay their drivers more and have less restrictions on who can dash because i tried to dash myself for over two years and they never accept me,1
1209,7586,doordash,719972451,2022-12-06 20:30:28,Downfall,take care of your dashers and maybe you you will be able to retain the good ones,1
1209,7587,doordash,719972451,2022-12-06 20:30:28,Downfall,do better doordash,1
1209,7588,doordash,719972451,2022-12-06 20:30:28,Downfall,i am cancelling my dash pass with you and using another platform now,1
1209,7589,doordash,719972451,2022-12-06 20:30:28,Downfall,you lost yet another loyal customer and their business,1
1210,7590,doordash,719972451,2022-11-02 00:21:11,Delivery,i love using door dash especially when your driver comes directly to your house,4
1210,7591,doordash,719972451,2022-11-02 00:21:11,Delivery,the time is as stated and the food is hot,4
1210,7592,doordash,719972451,2022-11-02 00:21:11,Delivery,however when the driver is stopping to drop off other orders not always from the same place my order is usually the second delivery,4
1210,7593,doordash,719972451,2022-11-02 00:21:11,Delivery,we have had drivers drop off the other order to our house,4
1210,7594,doordash,719972451,2022-11-02 00:21:11,Delivery,they cannot go back and exchange the order for health reasons,4
1210,7595,doordash,719972451,2022-11-02 00:21:11,Delivery,an hour and a half went by and we were refunded for the meal,4
1210,7596,doordash,719972451,2022-11-02 00:21:11,Delivery,no food,4
1210,7597,doordash,719972451,2022-11-02 00:21:11,Delivery,the delivery takes much more time when they go somewhere else and the food is often cold,4
1210,7598,doordash,719972451,2022-11-02 00:21:11,Delivery,one time i checked to see where the driver was on the road,4
1210,7599,doordash,719972451,2022-11-02 00:21:11,Delivery,the restaurant was fairly close to our home but his route took him in the opposite direction,4
1210,7600,doordash,719972451,2022-11-02 00:21:11,Delivery,i would be willing to give bigger tips if i knew i was the priority,4

1211,7605,doordash,719972451,2022-11-28 17:20:39,Please use any other food delivery service.,it is not a problem most of the time and sometimes the dashers will message or call me if they need help,1
1211,7606,doordash,719972451,2022-11-28 17:20:39,Please use any other food delivery service.,this time the dasher left my food at another location on the street that was unclear,1
1211,7607,doordash,719972451,2022-11-28 17:20:39,Please use any other food delivery service.,i therefore did not get my food cause i could not find it,1

1215,7640,doordash,719972451,2022-10-21 04:13:28,Terrible dashers and service,but here of late it seems doordash will let any idiot with a license work for them,1

1215,7645,doordash,719972451,2022-10-21 04:13:28,Terrible dashers and service,the only thing consistent about your services is the fact your drivers are never consistent or correct,1

1215,7647,doordash,719972451,2022-10-21 04:13:28,Terrible dashers and service,fix this or a better app will replace you and people will happily flock to a delivery service that knows what they are doing,1

1216,7655,doordash,719972451,2022-11-18 19:27:54,YOU HAVE BEEB WARNED!!!,then just now i made a dennys order and it was accidentally for pick up which i chose delivery okay and i contact support for them to say they can cancel it and i can reorder it so she did and connected me to another agent who couldnt refund me,1
1216,7656,doordash,719972451,2022-11-18 19:27:54,YOU HAVE BEEB WARNED!!!,so my order was canceled so i didnt have a choice but to donate 50 which 23 of it was not mine now i owe money and food to 2 people thanks to doordash plus i lost atleast 50 from yesterdays order,1
1217,7657,doordash,719972451,2022-11-01 00:34:25,"We are lazy, but so are you",yes i personally have the ability to go out and grab my food,1
1217,7658,doordash,719972451,2022-11-01 00:34:25,"We are lazy, but so are you",but what if i was sick or i could not or my circumstances were more severe,1
1217,7659,doordash,719972451,2022-11-01 00:34:25,"We are lazy, but so are you",this is not the best app to use if your order gets messed up,1
1217,7660,doordash,719972451,2022-11-01 00:34:25,"We are lazy, but so are you",my experience was really terrible over compensated apologies from customer servicewhich seemed more like a robot,1
1217,7661,doordash,719972451,2022-11-01 00:34:25,"We are lazy, but so are you",when i tried to resolve my problem they said it was outside of the window of resolution but never told me upon submitting my issue how long i had to resolve it so that is interesting,1
1217,7662,doordash,719972451,2022-11-01 00:34:25,"We are lazy, but so are you",the company is not customer service forward ok,1
1217,7663,doordash,719972451,2022-11-01 00:34:25,"We are lazy, but so are you",it is about getting cash quickly and dusting your hands of actually having to be involved with dealing with minor issues,1
1217,7664,doordash,719972451,2022-11-01 00:34:25,"We are lazy, but so are you",if you plan to have a company be prepared to deal with people and serve them if they pay for your expensive fees,1
1217,7665,doordash,719972451,2022-11-01 00:34:25,"We are lazy, but so are you",and if not i guess in 5 years someone else will find a way to do it better,1
1217,7666,doordash,719972451,2022-11-01 00:34:25,"We are lazy, but so are you",i would think i would consider the uber app instead if i were you,1
1218,7667,doordash,719972451,2022-10-08 03:42:53,Breaking up with DoorDash…….,i have used doordash for the past few years and everything about them has been continuously declining,1
1218,7668,doordash,719972451,2022-10-08 03:42:53,Breaking up with DoorDash…….,i have never had the issues with other food delivery companies that i have had with door dash which includes but is not limited to  long delivery times unfriendly dashers missing food cold food cancelled orders after waiting on them and without any explanation twice,1
1218,7669,doordash,719972451,2022-10-08 03:42:53,Breaking up with DoorDash…….,but i have to say the final straw for me is the huge price markups on food items,1
1218,7670,doordash,719972451,2022-10-08 03:42:53,Breaking up with DoorDash…….,like seriously,1

1231,7778,doordash,719972451,2022-10-21 04:41:49,DashPash Causes Order Problems,maybe you you will get the right order,1
1231,7779,doordash,719972451,2022-10-21 04:41:49,DashPash Causes Order Problems,maybe if you pay enough in tip your food is actually hot,1
1231,7780,doordash,719972451,2022-10-21 04:41:49,DashPash Causes Order Problems,drivers typically want 50 of the subtotal regardless of distance or size of orderbut if you pay for dashpass everything changes,1
1231,7781,doordash,719972451,2022-10-21 04:41:49,DashPash Causes Order Problems,every driver takes multiple orders and yours is last regardless of what you tip,1
1231,7782,doordash,719972451,2022-10-21 04:41:49,DashPash Causes Order Problems,on top of that more times than not you you will get the wrong order or missing items,1
1231,7783,doordash,719972451,2022-10-21 04:41:49,DashPash Causes Order Problems,or your driver will spill your drinks and blame the drink carrierand what does support do,1
1231,7784,doordash,719972451,2022-10-21 04:41:49,DashPash Causes Order Problems,doordash credits,1
1231,7785,doordash,719972451,2022-10-21 04:41:49,DashPash Causes Order Problems,they might tell you they will refund your payment method,1
1231,7786,doordash,719972451,2022-10-21 04:41:49,DashPash Causes Order Problems,but you you will still only get credits back only useable on doordash,1
1231,7787,doordash,719972451,2022-10-21 04:41:49,DashPash Causes Order Problems,so if they mess up enough the only way to get your money back is to order again,1
1231,7788,doordash,719972451,2022-10-21 04:41:49,DashPash Causes Order Problems,and it is going to get just as messed up,1
1231,7789,doordash,719972451,2022-10-21 04:41:49,DashPash Causes Order Problems,besides all of this the prices are entirely wrong for everything,1
1231,7790,doordash,719972451,2022-10-21 04:41:49,DashPash Causes Order Problems,for every single available item you pay an up charge on the initial price,1
1231,7791,doordash,719972451,2022-10-21 04:41:49,DashPash Causes Order Problems,compare any in store price to doordash and it is impossible to miss the upcharge on the subtotal,1
1231,7792,doordash,719972451,2022-10-21 04:41:49,DashPash Causes Order Problems,add taxes and fees,1
1231,7793,doordash,719972451,2022-10-21 04:41:49,DashPash Causes Order Problems,monitor taxes and fees,1
1231,7794,doordash,719972451,2022-10-21 04:41:49,DashPash Causes Order Problems,even the monthly 9 dashpass fee does not change much of anything from the end user cost per order all considered,1
1232,7795,doordash,719972451,2022-10-10 16:24:48,Support is awful,i have ordered a few times from doordash and honestly support is impossible,2
1232,7796,doordash,719972451,2022-10-10 16:24:48,Support is awful,usually if i have to get something from a store they do not even list the right available items,2
1232,7797,doordash,719972451,2022-10-10 16:24:48,Support is awful,i have to go through support and try to change the substitutions they allow to get what the driver says is available,2
1232,7798,doordash,719972451,2022-10-10 16:24:48,Support is awful,honestly at this point it is less of a headache to get it myself,2
1232,7799,doordash,719972451,2022-10-10 16:24:48,Support is awful,not to mention support takes forever and usually just cancels the order when this happens so i get nothing,2
1232,7800,doordash,719972451,2022-10-10 16:24:48,Support is awful,not to mention i was promised credits as part of a refund when this last happened they were never delivered and when i asked support about it again they said they basically had no clue what i was talking about,2
1232,7801,doordash,719972451,2022-10-10 16:24:48,Support is awful,it did not use to be this bad the app was great for getting supplies when i had covid but it really went downhill,2
1233,7802,doordash,719972451,2022-10-17 21:17:23,Unhappy Customer,i tried to place two orders yesterday and both were cancelled because both of the businesses were closed yet they were still available on the app,1
1233,7803,doordash,719972451,2022-10-17 21:17:23,Unhappy Customer,the money was taken out of my account,1
1233,7804,doordash,719972451,2022-10-17 21:17:23,Unhappy Customer,fast forward to today i am having pain and discomfort so i order what i needed from cvs and it is delivered to the wrong place,1
1233,7805,doordash,719972451,2022-10-17 21:17:23,Unhappy Customer,i text would contact support and showed them the picture the dasher send of the mat and door they delivered to,1
1233,7806,doordash,719972451,2022-10-17 21:17:23,Unhappy Customer,i also sent a picture of my mat to prove they delivered to the wrong place,1
1233,7807,doordash,719972451,2022-10-17 21:17:23,Unhappy Customer,they told me my case was under review and someone would make contact with me in 24 hours,1
1233,7808,doordash,719972451,2022-10-17 21:17:23,Unhappy Customer,i ordered medicine for pain to be delivered so i would not have to go get it myself,1
1233,7809,doordash,719972451,2022-10-17 21:17:23,Unhappy Customer,it was the dashers mistake but they refused to just resend my order,1
1233,7810,doordash,719972451,2022-10-17 21:17:23,Unhappy Customer,three issues within two days that is too frequent,1
1233,7811,doordash,719972451,2022-10-17 21:17:23,Unhappy Customer,i am deleting the app and choosing another option,1
1233,7812,doordash,719972451,2022-10-17 21:17:23,Unhappy Customer,this is ridiculous,1
1234,7813,doordash,719972451,2022-11-08 05:50:58,The only problem,the only problem with doordash is sometime they will have stores showing it is available but they might be closed then if your order it canceled you can get credit but if you get a refund back to your card it is gonna take a whole week and most time you cannot pick if you want credit or your money back and some of the dashers will steal your food so be careful and use uber eats it is the complete opposite of doordash,5
1234,7814,doordash,719972451,2022-11-08 05:50:58,The only problem,if your order get cancale your get your money back right then and there you do not have to wait and they show you that the store is open or close and the right days and time they open,5
1235,7815,doordash,719972451,2022-10-09 03:44:41,Garbage service at rip off prices with no CS,the title says it all,1
1235,7816,doordash,719972451,2022-10-09 03:44:41,Garbage service at rip off prices with no CS,i do not know how many times this service has left me hanging in salt lake waiting for food that is cold missing items or just does not show up at all,1
1235,7817,doordash,719972451,2022-10-09 03:44:41,Garbage service at rip off prices with no CS,usually it is a super long extended wait past the estimated time plus one of those other problems,1
1235,7818,doordash,719972451,2022-10-09 03:44:41,Garbage service at rip off prices with no CS,they offer a fraction of compensation of what missing items cost,1
1235,7819,doordash,719972451,2022-10-09 03:44:41,Garbage service at rip off prices with no CS,even when a whole meal is missing from delivery or wrong they will try to give you a base refund taking 57 business days while you are out of luck on feeding your family and everything else is closing,1
1235,7820,doordash,719972451,2022-10-09 03:44:41,Garbage service at rip off prices with no CS,most of it is the garbage quality of delivery drivers probably due to garbage pay despite the fact door dash emphasizes tips for better service,1
1235,7821,doordash,719972451,2022-10-09 03:44:41,Garbage service at rip off prices with no CS,this is garbage i wish i had every penny back i have spent that dd made at this point,1
1235,7822,doordash,719972451,2022-10-09 03:44:41,Garbage service at rip off prices with no CS,i am probably 30 bad deliverys deep and fully deleting this garbage,1
1236,7823,doordash,719972451,2022-10-05 23:38:52,Worst Company,their dasher hit my car the dashers insurance does not cover me because they do not cover rider services and doordash denied me even after further investigation determined their dasher was found to be at fault,1
1236,7824,doordash,719972451,2022-10-05 23:38:52,Worst Company,it is been over a month and have not gotten any further word from doordash after numerous attempts to get an update or answer on my claim,1
1236,7825,doordash,719972451,2022-10-05 23:38:52,Worst Company,just a warning to current and future users of doordash there is a huge loop hole that allows drivers with subpar coverage to drive for doordash and in the event of something like this happening the customer or bystander is left dry to pay for damages that were completely the fault of the doordasher and doordash entirely when they refuse to do the right thing,1
1236,7826,doordash,719972451,2022-10-05 23:38:52,Worst Company,you are better off picking up your own food if you are just going to be held accountable in the event of damages occurring regardless of who is at fault,1
1236,7827,doordash,719972451,2022-10-05 23:38:52,Worst Company,very disappointed in doordash,1
1236,7828,doordash,719972451,2022-10-05 23:38:52,Worst Company,i will be canceling my subscription,1
1237,7829,doordash,719972451,2022-11-20 22:31:43,"Overall nice, but wish tip offering is AFTER",i enjoy having the option of food being delivered to me,3
1237,7830,doordash,719972451,2022-11-20 22:31:43,"Overall nice, but wish tip offering is AFTER",especially when i work at a place where i cannot leave the campus such as the hospital,3
1237,7831,doordash,719972451,2022-11-20 22:31:43,"Overall nice, but wish tip offering is AFTER",or when i live alone and sick i can have someone deliver takeout groceries or even some medications for me,3
1237,7832,doordash,719972451,2022-11-20 22:31:43,"Overall nice, but wish tip offering is AFTER",however i only wish that the option for tipping the dasher pops up once the delivery is made similar to ubereats,3
1237,7833,doordash,719972451,2022-11-20 22:31:43,"Overall nice, but wish tip offering is AFTER",how can i properly tip them prior,3
1237,7834,doordash,719972451,2022-11-20 22:31:43,"Overall nice, but wish tip offering is AFTER",is that supposed to be motivation for the dasher to earn money,3
1237,7835,doordash,719972451,2022-11-20 22:31:43,"Overall nice, but wish tip offering is AFTER",i do not tip much anymore because when i do my dasher does not deliver well and becomes too complicated and does not work out well,3
1237,7836,doordash,719972451,2022-11-20 22:31:43,"Overall nice, but wish tip offering is AFTER",so i would like the option to tip after delivery has been completed if that is something that could be changed,3
1237,7837,doordash,719972451,2022-11-20 22:31:43,"Overall nice, but wish tip offering is AFTER",thank you,3
1238,7838,doordash,719972451,2022-11-01 20:33:30,Terrible Service!!,i hen i tell you the fact that anyone can work for this company and they do not care about the way the treat you i mean it,1
1238,7839,doordash,719972451,2022-11-01 20:33:30,Terrible Service!!,i had a delivery driver who called cussing me out because they had to park across the street instead of out front,1
1238,7840,doordash,719972451,2022-11-01 20:33:30,Terrible Service!!,then when i opened the door and they were walking away in front of my toddler they started cussing me out,1
1238,7841,doordash,719972451,2022-11-01 20:33:30,Terrible Service!!,it was f you mf,1
1238,7842,doordash,719972451,2022-11-01 20:33:30,Terrible Service!!,and a bunch of other stuff my baby was scared and started crying then my husband came out and all of a sudden this make delivery driver changed his tone,1
1238,7843,doordash,719972451,2022-11-01 20:33:30,Terrible Service!!,he got really nervous and afraid and tried to play victim,1
1238,7844,doordash,719972451,2022-11-01 20:33:30,Terrible Service!!,when i called customer service to report the incident they said the best they could do was refund me the 3 delivery fee,1
1238,7845,doordash,719972451,2022-11-01 20:33:30,Terrible Service!!,i miss the days when customer service mattered,1
1238,7846,doordash,719972451,2022-11-01 20:33:30,Terrible Service!!,i do not expect people to take being treated like less than from anyone but that should also mean you cannot treat customers like this with no repercussions,1
1239,7847,doordash,719972451,2022-11-01 20:07:33,Annoying filter issue,doordash is certainly convenient sometimes but the app can be somewhat frustrating,3
1239,7848,doordash,719972451,2022-11-01 20:07:33,Annoying filter issue,it is possible that some of the problems are because of the way restaurants enter informationi have no idea how it works on that endso i will stick with my biggest gripe when i use the filters on the home page of the app and then spend a few seconds too long looking at a restaurant page less than a minute is apparently too long the filters have been reset when i come back,3
1239,7849,doordash,719972451,2022-11-01 20:07:33,Annoying filter issue,and then i have to set them again and start the whole process over,3
1239,7850,doordash,719972451,2022-11-01 20:07:33,Annoying filter issue,extremely obnoxious,3
1239,7851,doordash,719972451,2022-11-01 20:07:33,Annoying filter issue,i know i am not the only person who needs to browse so how about keeping the filters until a person resets them or until they order,3
1240,7852,doordash,719972451,2022-12-04 18:55:17,Changing location and poor customer service,i order the same order at the same location consistently for pickup,1
1240,7853,doordash,719972451,2022-12-04 18:55:17,Changing location and poor customer service,twice now doordash has updated the location to somewhere 20 minutes away,1
1240,7854,doordash,719972451,2022-12-04 18:55:17,Changing location and poor customer service,the first time the manager was understanding and made my order at their location but i had to wait about 20 minutes,1
1240,7855,doordash,719972451,2022-12-04 18:55:17,Changing location and poor customer service,this time the manager was extremely rude and said drive to the other location,1
1240,7856,doordash,719972451,2022-12-04 18:55:17,Changing location and poor customer service,i called customer service to just get a refund and they put me on a 20 minute hold just to of canceled the order on their end and not even give me a refund,1
1240,7857,doordash,719972451,2022-12-04 18:55:17,Changing location and poor customer service,the customer service assistant even told me to just drive and go ask anyways,1
1240,7858,doordash,719972451,2022-12-04 18:55:17,Changing location and poor customer service,what kind of buggy app and sub par customer service is this,1
1240,7859,doordash,719972451,2022-12-04 18:55:17,Changing location and poor customer service,this was my final straw with all the terrible experiences i have had so far,1
1240,7860,doordash,719972451,2022-12-04 18:55:17,Changing location and poor customer service,no more door dash deleting my account and app,1
1240,7861,doordash,719972451,2022-12-04 18:55:17,Changing location and poor customer service,try uber eats or something more reliable instead,1
1241,7862,doordash,719972451,2022-11-15 19:04:50,Delicious food!,my first experience with this restaurant is the best first experience i have ever had with a restaurant,5

1241,7865,doordash,719972451,2022-11-15 19:04:50,Delicious food!,i ordered the mac and cheese but they were out of it so they substituted the rasta pasta,5
1241,7866,doordash,719972451,2022-11-15 19:04:50,Delicious food!,so happy with the substitution,5
1241,7867,doordash,719972451,2022-11-15 19:04:50,Delicious food!,the lunch special curry chicken was flavorful and had the perfect amount of heat,5
1241,7868,doordash,719972451,2022-11-15 19:04:50,Delicious food!,the steamed vegetables were tasty and not overlooked like in so many other places,5
1241,7869,doordash,719972451,2022-11-15 19:04:50,Delicious food!,the rice was perfectly cooked and was a great compliment to the chicken,5
1241,7870,doordash,719972451,2022-11-15 19:04:50,Delicious food!,the jerk chicken empanadas we are out of this world,5

1241,7872,doordash,719972451,2022-11-15 19:04:50,Delicious food!,pretty sure i am going to order dinner from them tonight,5
1242,7873,doordash,719972451,2022-09-20 16:36:36,THIEVES,they have no form of properly qualifying they are drivers as there is many that sign up and steal your food by not delivering it,5
1242,7874,doordash,719972451,2022-09-20 16:36:36,THIEVES,then when you try to get a refund doordash declines that request,5
1242,7875,doordash,719972451,2022-09-20 16:36:36,THIEVES,i had a guy take a picture of the road not even getting off his car just opening the door while my order is clearly in his hands and driving off with the food all caught on my ring security camera,5
1242,7876,doordash,719972451,2022-09-20 16:36:36,THIEVES,do not order from here even the regular drivers constantly forget to get your whole order or properly ask for the items,5

1242,7878,doordash,719972451,2022-09-20 16:36:36,THIEVES,they are terrible,5

1243,7880,doordash,719972451,2022-09-27 02:35:34,DOORDASH PROCESSING STEALS UR MONEY,using another card on an account can result in the cardholder being charged for dashpass for months even after the account owner removes the card and cancels doordash on their account,1
1243,7881,doordash,719972451,2022-09-27 02:35:34,DOORDASH PROCESSING STEALS UR MONEY,this means that multiple people can be paying for a dashpass that does not exist,1
1243,7882,doordash,719972451,2022-09-27 02:35:34,DOORDASH PROCESSING STEALS UR MONEY,that is not all,1
1243,7883,doordash,719972451,2022-09-27 02:35:34,DOORDASH PROCESSING STEALS UR MONEY,sometimes they will charge you once sometimes twice a month for the same dashpass,1

1244,7893,doordash,719972451,2022-10-13 00:40:11,Literally a scam at this point,the lady on support told me there was nothing she could do and refused to let me speak to a supervisor or superior which i was not going to do to get her in trouble i know some things they do not have the power to override,1
1244,7894,doordash,719972451,2022-10-13 00:40:11,Literally a scam at this point,i hung up and called back because i was not taking the unnecessary rudeness anymore and the next person told me they could issue me a credit which i was fine with,1

1245,7898,doordash,719972451,2022-09-26 04:51:44,I hate them so much,i am not lying or scamming doordash for credits but i have ordered food and got denied compensation due to having many reports but because doordash or the restaurant constantly mess up my food,1
1245,7899,doordash,719972451,2022-09-26 04:51:44,I hate them so much,i am upset because i paid 17 and could not even receive credit but completely am going to bed hungry,1
1245,7900,doordash,719972451,2022-09-26 04:51:44,I hate them so much,i have not received my order and the dasher did not deliver it to the right address because it says she left it but i had not seen a single bag for my food and im very upset i even feel hatred for doordash because of how often they have done nothing but completely messed up all my orders,1
1245,7901,doordash,719972451,2022-09-26 04:51:44,I hate them so much,pretttl is the name on doordash and i must say i am very very mad still i worked too hard for the money i paid for that food for so i really was almost crying bc i just wanted food,1
1246,7902,doordash,719972451,2022-09-19 00:53:56,Deceptive advertising,i rarely post reviews but felt like i should not let these issues sit as they could impact others not paying attention,1
1246,7903,doordash,719972451,2022-09-19 00:53:56,Deceptive advertising,we will be deleting this app after tonights experience,1
1246,7905,doordash,719972451,2022-09-19 00:53:56,Deceptive advertising,doordash provided me a promo to entice me to place an order,1
1246,7906,doordash,719972451,2022-09-19 00:53:56,Deceptive advertising,at checkout they declined to honor that promo,1
1246,7907,doordash,719972451,2022-09-19 00:53:56,Deceptive advertising,there were no explanations,1
1246,7909,doordash,719972451,2022-09-19 00:53:56,Deceptive advertising,doordash advertised no delivery fee initially for the restaurant i was ordering from however at checkout it somehow added a deliver fee,1
1246,7910,doordash,719972451,2022-09-19 00:53:56,Deceptive advertising,was that a bug,1
1246,7911,doordash,719972451,2022-09-19 00:53:56,Deceptive advertising,i am not sure,1
1246,7912,doordash,719972451,2022-09-19 00:53:56,Deceptive advertising,but given the other issues my guess is it is a feature and they are advertising of fee is wonky at best,1
1246,7914,doordash,719972451,2022-09-19 00:53:56,Deceptive advertising,even if there was no delivery fee there was a 15 service fee which is not for the dasher,1
1246,7915,doordash,719972451,2022-09-19 00:53:56,Deceptive advertising,they mix that additional fee into the taxes section of the bill,1
1246,7916,doordash,719972451,2022-09-19 00:53:56,Deceptive advertising,let us face it doordash that is a delivery fee through the eyes of the consumer trying to figure out how much it will cost to order delivery,1
1246,7918,doordash,719972451,2022-09-19 00:53:56,Deceptive advertising,they promote a monthly pass and that you can sign up for a trial to fees waived,1
1246,7919,doordash,719972451,2022-09-19 00:53:56,Deceptive advertising,however when i went to sign up for that the app again had another error and would not apply,1
1246,7920,doordash,719972451,2022-09-19 00:53:56,Deceptive advertising,all in all my order would have been 2530 more expensive than just picking up,1
1246,7921,doordash,719972451,2022-09-19 00:53:56,Deceptive advertising,for some that may be worth it,1
1246,7922,doordash,719972451,2022-09-19 00:53:56,Deceptive advertising,but even for those that it is i am sure they would like transparency,1
1247,7924,doordash,719972451,2022-09-24 23:25:51,I didn't have any problems,i had not read any of the reviews before i placed my order,5
1247,7925,doordash,719972451,2022-09-24 23:25:51,I didn't have any problems,in any case i was very happy with the app as well as the speedy service,5
1247,7926,doordash,719972451,2022-09-24 23:25:51,I didn't have any problems,my delivery driver was kind and patient with trying to locate my place he actually tried calling but i did not realize that i had my phone on silent and i was out in my garden awaiting my orderwatering plants,5
1247,7927,doordash,719972451,2022-09-24 23:25:51,I didn't have any problems,thankfully i looked at my phone and saw that he had messaged me asking for more specific directions to my home,5
1247,7928,doordash,719972451,2022-09-24 23:25:51,I didn't have any problems,within a couple minutes of messaging him back bam,5
1247,7929,doordash,719972451,2022-09-24 23:25:51,I didn't have any problems,my order was here,5
1247,7931,doordash,719972451,2022-09-24 23:25:51,I didn't have any problems,first time doordash user definitely will be a repeat customer,5
1248,7934,doordash,719972451,2022-11-09 01:00:56,Isometimes I get shortchanged,i am a dash pass member,3
1248,7935,doordash,719972451,2022-11-09 01:00:56,Isometimes I get shortchanged,i frequently order groceries from a local retailer,3
1248,7936,doordash,719972451,2022-11-09 01:00:56,Isometimes I get shortchanged,whenever they do not have an item a refund is processed for the item,3
1248,7937,doordash,719972451,2022-11-09 01:00:56,Isometimes I get shortchanged,so if i order 25 things and 5 are not available they have to refund me for 5,3
1248,7938,doordash,719972451,2022-11-09 01:00:56,Isometimes I get shortchanged,well in the system it looks like i am always requesting refunds which i am not,3
1248,7939,doordash,719972451,2022-11-09 01:00:56,Isometimes I get shortchanged,so if i order from a restaurant and do not receive all of my items i am unable to get refunded because the computer looks at all refunds the same,3
1248,7940,doordash,719972451,2022-11-09 01:00:56,Isometimes I get shortchanged,so in a sense it is not worth it to get the dash pass because if i am missing items they refuse to refund me my money from fast food restaurants,3
1248,7941,doordash,719972451,2022-11-09 01:00:56,Isometimes I get shortchanged,it is very frustrating,3
1248,7942,doordash,719972451,2022-11-09 01:00:56,Isometimes I get shortchanged,and they do not take your word over a 5 item not good customer service at all,3
1249,7943,doordash,719972451,2022-11-25 22:20:20,Disgusted,i have no idea how many times my order has been canceled after i have waited and waited,2

1249,7946,doordash,719972451,2022-11-25 22:20:20,Disgusted,at first estimated delivery was 440 pm then it constantly got pushed back until delivery time was 520 pm,2
1249,7947,doordash,719972451,2022-11-25 22:20:20,Disgusted,mind you this wendys is a five minute drive from my house,2
1249,7948,doordash,719972451,2022-11-25 22:20:20,Disgusted,i cannot drive due to medical reasons so i was really relying on doordash for my daughters birthday dinner that is what she wanted,2
1249,7949,doordash,719972451,2022-11-25 22:20:20,Disgusted,however at 520 pm i got the notification that my order was canceled because wendys computers never got it,2
1249,7950,doordash,719972451,2022-11-25 22:20:20,Disgusted,i called wendys and they had prepared the order and the dasher just never showed up,2
1249,7951,doordash,719972451,2022-11-25 22:20:20,Disgusted,i asked for a refund on the doordash app and it has been five days and no show of me getting my money back,2
1249,7952,doordash,719972451,2022-11-25 22:20:20,Disgusted,absolutely disgusted,2

1250,7960,doordash,719972451,2022-11-13 17:30:30,KGC,i then looked at my surveillance cameras and observed a gold color car stopped in front of my house,1
1250,7961,doordash,719972451,2022-11-13 17:30:30,KGC,i then received a notice that my food was delivered and a photo of the food in a bag,1
1250,7962,doordash,719972451,2022-11-13 17:30:30,KGC,it look like it was in her vehicle when she took the photo,1

1250,7968,doordash,719972451,2022-11-13 17:30:30,KGC,deleted the apt,1
1251,7969,doordash,719972451,2022-10-09 22:22:31,Insubordinate employees,i ordered from doordash and when the driver called me to say that he could not find my place i was giving him directions on how to get to my place he got all flustered and told me i do not know man i do not know i just do not know where i am going i am going in circles and i said well maybe you should have a job like this if you do not know directions then he is like well where do i go and i go to where are you at cause i do not know man i do not know there is no street signs there is street signs all over,1
1251,7970,doordash,719972451,2022-10-09 22:22:31,Insubordinate employees,so if you ever get andrew as your door dasher make sure to cancel that order and order from someone else,1
1251,7971,doordash,719972451,2022-10-09 22:22:31,Insubordinate employees,not only did i not get my food but when i went to reorder he had taken so long that the place that i ordered from was closed,1
1251,7972,doordash,719972451,2022-10-09 22:22:31,Insubordinate employees,terrible terrible terrible if i could do a negative rating i would do a 75 andrew is a terrible employee,1
1252,7973,doordash,719972451,2022-12-06 01:51:44,Awesome app poorly executed,i have an issue were i order something even with paying for premium fast delivery were drivers will add to there route and deliver to people who ordered after first and wait at other restaurants by the time i get my food it is 30 to 40 minutes past delivery time and my food is ice cold because the drivers are not using hot bags and it is way over the delivery time and i have had 3 instances of drivers dropping food off around the block from my house i have lucked out and managed to get it before someone else has but there needs to be consistency across the board cause if you think about say you order a gyro like i did today it has lettuce in it by the time i get it it is super soggy and already gone cold even though i pay for fast delivery and dashpass,2
1253,7974,doordash,719972451,2022-12-02 10:35:20,They Literally Steal Your Money,i started doordash a couple months ago,1

1254,8002,doordash,719972451,2022-11-25 00:43:21,What people should know,i will go get the food myself and using the example i just gave save 20 dollars in fees for a store that is like 20 miles from me,1
1254,8003,doordash,719972451,2022-11-25 00:43:21,What people should know,do not let them lie to you they found my number when they ended the chat because i did not provide it,1
1254,8004,doordash,719972451,2022-11-25 00:43:21,What people should know,they do not need the number or email just to answer that one question,1
1255,8005,doordash,719972451,2022-10-01 00:23:30,Missing order,the worst customer service ever,1
1255,8006,doordash,719972451,2022-10-01 00:23:30,Missing order,ordered dinner that worth 100  and waited an hour but nothing was delivered even though the driver put my order was delivered,1
1255,8007,doordash,719972451,2022-10-01 00:23:30,Missing order,when i reported the problem i was told that my report has been noted and someone was going to contact me but nobody did,1
1255,8008,doordash,719972451,2022-10-01 00:23:30,Missing order,i contacted the customer support and they said at first i was supposed to contact them right away when i told them what happened they said wat for an email and of course nothing so i contacted back and they told me that they cannot do anything about my last order and i was not going to get any kind of refund,1
1255,8009,doordash,719972451,2022-10-01 00:23:30,Missing order,i have been using the app for a few years never had any problem before this so very disappointed not sure if i can order something else again knowing i am not going to get any help if something like this happen again,1
1256,8010,doordash,719972451,2022-12-11 02:36:33,Used to love this app but,i was looking through dash pass options clicked a link i thought would take me to more information but it instead immediately subscribed me something i was not looking to do,1
1256,8011,doordash,719972451,2022-12-11 02:36:33,Used to love this app but,so i go to try and cancel the subscription,1
1256,8012,doordash,719972451,2022-12-11 02:36:33,Used to love this app but,as i am doing so the app offers me 2 months free trial to dash pass,1
1256,8013,doordash,719972451,2022-12-11 02:36:33,Used to love this app but,ok cool that is fine,1
1256,8014,doordash,719972451,2022-12-11 02:36:33,Used to love this app but,so i follow through with canceling my unintentional subscription,1
1256,8015,doordash,719972451,2022-12-11 02:36:33,Used to love this app but,open the app a few days later to find the dash pass trial is gone,1
1256,8016,doordash,719972451,2022-12-11 02:36:33,Used to love this app but,i call and ask about it and am not given any real answer just told well there is nothing we can do about it,1
1256,8017,doordash,719972451,2022-12-11 02:36:33,Used to love this app but,so they made an offer a promise if you will i accepted then they decided they just were not going to follow through with it,1
1256,8018,doordash,719972451,2022-12-11 02:36:33,Used to love this app but,that they could renege on a deal,1
1256,8019,doordash,719972451,2022-12-11 02:36:33,Used to love this app but,strikes me as shady and unethical at a minimum,1
1256,8020,doordash,719972451,2022-12-11 02:36:33,Used to love this app but,so despite using this app routinely you all have now lost a customer,1
1257,8021,doordash,719972451,2022-11-28 22:16:05,Used to be good,as doordash has evolved it has taken on more and more shady business practices,1
1257,8022,doordash,719972451,2022-11-28 22:16:05,Used to be good,today if i order say a pizza and a couple sodas but they do not bring the soda,1
1257,8023,doordash,719972451,2022-11-28 22:16:05,Used to be good,they will credit your account instead of bringing you what you paid for already,1
1257,8024,doordash,719972451,2022-11-28 22:16:05,Used to be good,this way you have to order again and pay the delivery fees and whatever other bloated charge they want to add on,1
1257,8025,doordash,719972451,2022-11-28 22:16:05,Used to be good,sure you could credit back to the original payment method but that does not change the fact that you did not get what you paid for or that you have to pay extra again to get it,1
1257,8026,doordash,719972451,2022-11-28 22:16:05,Used to be good,they have tried to take the responsibility off of them by saying it is the stores fault our drivers do not know,1
1257,8027,doordash,719972451,2022-11-28 22:16:05,Used to be good,well they used too,1
1257,8028,doordash,719972451,2022-11-28 22:16:05,Used to be good,then you want me to tip the driver who is not actually doing anything at all now,1
1257,8029,doordash,719972451,2022-11-28 22:16:05,Used to be good,rightlike i said,1
1257,8030,doordash,719972451,2022-11-28 22:16:05,Used to be good,it used to be good,1
1258,8031,doordash,719972451,2022-11-09 17:42:03,Ummm…,i usually always go to the store buy and pick up my own food,1
1258,8032,doordash,719972451,2022-11-09 17:42:03,Ummm…,recently i have been using this app,1
1258,8033,doordash,719972451,2022-11-09 17:42:03,Ummm…,all the food is taxed on top of the actual price through this app on top of that you want me to wait an hour for the delivery and still want me to give the driver a tip,1
1258,8034,doordash,719972451,2022-11-09 17:42:03,Ummm…,not happening,1
1258,8035,doordash,719972451,2022-11-09 17:42:03,Ummm…,my food could usually cost 10 and i will be paying 20 just for the food before the delivery prices and taxes come in,1
1258,8036,doordash,719972451,2022-11-09 17:42:03,Ummm…,it can say it is an 8 minute pick up but 50 minute delivery when the store is down the street,1
1258,8037,doordash,719972451,2022-11-09 17:42:03,Ummm…,i am sorry but this app is really unacceptable looking at it from someone who usually does it themselves,1
1258,8038,doordash,719972451,2022-11-09 17:42:03,Ummm…,it is a scam and you guys are getting a lot of money out of this and still want me to pay a tip to the dasher,1
1258,8039,doordash,719972451,2022-11-09 17:42:03,Ummm…,i am sorry but you guys can pay the tip if my order is 10 more then what it usually will be,1
1258,8040,doordash,719972451,2022-11-09 17:42:03,Ummm…,not including delivery taxes or tip,1
1259,8041,doordash,719972451,2022-11-15 00:19:47,System is messed up,i cannot leave a poor review for my driver after i filled a complaint,1
1259,8042,doordash,719972451,2022-11-15 00:19:47,System is messed up,i waited 45 min for a pop i ordered it was sent to the completely wrong house,1
1259,8043,doordash,719972451,2022-11-15 00:19:47,System is messed up,it was not a complicated address,1
1259,8044,doordash,719972451,2022-11-15 00:19:47,System is messed up,i even gave directions in the description in case they struggled,1
1259,8045,doordash,719972451,2022-11-15 00:19:47,System is messed up,yet my dasher now gets my tip and no poor review,1
1259,8046,doordash,719972451,2022-11-15 00:19:47,System is messed up,gets out scotch free,1
1259,8047,doordash,719972451,2022-11-15 00:19:47,System is messed up,all i get is a redund so i can order it again and try again,1
1259,8048,doordash,719972451,2022-11-15 00:19:47,System is messed up,no coupons no discount just a chance to give them their money back all over again,1
1259,8049,doordash,719972451,2022-11-15 00:19:47,System is messed up,so now 80min for my order as i try again,1
1259,8050,doordash,719972451,2022-11-15 00:19:47,System is messed up,this is why i have never used doordash and lesson learned i will never use it again after todaynot to mention the pop was for kids by the time they get here they will get put in the fridge for tomorrow because it will be their bedtime,1
1259,8051,doordash,719972451,2022-11-15 00:19:47,System is messed up,so now i have to deal with disappointed kids,1
1260,8053,doordash,719972451,2022-10-07 23:29:17,Some suggestions for better dasher-customer communication,i use dd all of the time and i am even a dasher myself,4
1260,8054,doordash,719972451,2022-10-07 23:29:17,Some suggestions for better dasher-customer communication,though i feel like there could be some ways the communication between the dasher and their customers can be better a way to see how busy an area is when ordering to get a rough gauge of how long the delivery may take a pop up of sorts that would encourage a customer to tip more if an area or specific restaurant has long wait times like for taco bell at night time,4
1260,8055,doordash,719972451,2022-10-07 23:29:17,Some suggestions for better dasher-customer communication,the ability to let us choose a cash tip option,4
1260,8056,doordash,719972451,2022-10-07 23:29:17,Some suggestions for better dasher-customer communication,sometimes it is much easier to tip cash but since it is a dying currency i can understand why it is not an option,4
1261,8057,doordash,719972451,2022-11-20 16:55:04,Dear door dash,costumer service really trash and they will send you into very dangerous places and they would not care  because all about there business not your life even low pay rate when you gotta do more miles then the pay and even in drop off you going to have trouble in the maps never a correct address etc,5
1261,8058,doordash,719972451,2022-11-20 16:55:04,Dear door dash,they even deactivate you if you do not accept them low balling when they know gas aint cheap so really it is not up to you it is up the them when you should accept or not,5
1261,8059,doordash,719972451,2022-11-20 16:55:04,Dear door dash,this is a horrible company to work for take it as that and keep it moving,5
1262,8060,doordash,719972451,2022-10-25 19:46:03,"Using the new ""DoubleDash"" dual order same driver never works",placing an order using doubledash to pick up a 2nd order from a nearby place using the same driver to save yourself a delivery fee never works,1
1262,8061,doordash,719972451,2022-10-25 19:46:03,"Using the new ""DoubleDash"" dual order same driver never works",the system always drops or never submits the 2nd order and then cistern service tells you to just place another order and pay all of the delivery fees and tips for a separate order that will arrive in another 4590 minutes,1
1262,8062,doordash,719972451,2022-10-25 19:46:03,"Using the new ""DoubleDash"" dual order same driver never works",meanwhile the system calculates a dasher tip based on the doublecombined orders and then when only 1 order arrives doordash refuses to recalculate or refund the double tip amount,1
1262,8063,doordash,719972451,2022-10-25 19:46:03,"Using the new ""DoubleDash"" dual order same driver never works",they chose to permanently lose me as a longtime customer rather than to just simply acknowledge there was some technical issues going on,1
1262,8064,doordash,719972451,2022-10-25 19:46:03,"Using the new ""DoubleDash"" dual order same driver never works",i closed my account permanently and all my delivery orders will be through uber now,1
1262,8066,doordash,719972451,2022-10-25 19:46:03,"Using the new ""DoubleDash"" dual order same driver never works",goodbye doordash,1
1263,8067,doordash,719972451,2022-10-21 02:21:32,Misleading and,when the delivery fees are posted they should be charged as such,1
1263,8068,doordash,719972451,2022-10-21 02:21:32,Misleading and,it blows my mind doordash gets away with adding additional delivery fees in a section called taxes and fees,1
1263,8069,doordash,719972451,2022-10-21 02:21:32,Misleading and,they should probably categorize the taxes separately so we know we are not paying tax on any intangible items like their fees on fees,1
1263,8070,doordash,719972451,2022-10-21 02:21:32,Misleading and,then they have the audacity to recommend we give like a 35 tip,1
1263,8071,doordash,719972451,2022-10-21 02:21:32,Misleading and,we tip on the total of items purchased,1
1263,8072,doordash,719972451,2022-10-21 02:21:32,Misleading and,not including the delivery fees and whatever other fees they try to hide,1
1263,8073,doordash,719972451,2022-10-21 02:21:32,Misleading and,a 20 tip on my 30 purchase which was 40 after their 299 delivery fee would be 6,1
1263,8074,doordash,719972451,2022-10-21 02:21:32,Misleading and,and that used to be considered generous,1
1263,8075,doordash,719972451,2022-10-21 02:21:32,Misleading and,yet i have to hit other amount and type in my generous tip as if i was doing something wrong,1
1263,8076,doordash,719972451,2022-10-21 02:21:32,Misleading and,i will delete the app and use others from now on,1
1263,8077,doordash,719972451,2022-10-21 02:21:32,Misleading and,hope the creators are spending their billions wisely,1
1263,8078,doordash,719972451,2022-10-21 02:21:32,Misleading and,like not ordering from doordash,1

1264,8080,doordash,719972451,2022-09-29 15:20:20,Love DD & DashPass,if you use dd  least twice a month or more you should get dashpass  it is definitely worth it,5
1264,8081,doordash,719972451,2022-09-29 15:20:20,Love DD & DashPass,pay annually to save even more money on fees deliveries and dashpass dues,5
1264,8082,doordash,719972451,2022-09-29 15:20:20,Love DD & DashPass,i am on a first name basis with most of my local dashers lol but i must admit ivan is the best he is a rockstar,5
1264,8083,doordash,719972451,2022-09-29 15:20:20,Love DD & DashPass,dd is always convenient and prompt,5
1264,8084,doordash,719972451,2022-09-29 15:20:20,Love DD & DashPass,i have been using it for yrs and i have only had one issue and i use it 3 or 4 times a week sometimes,5
1264,8085,doordash,719972451,2022-09-29 15:20:20,Love DD & DashPass,i love how it is designed to give you real time updates and info about your order and dasher,5
1264,8086,doordash,719972451,2022-09-29 15:20:20,Love DD & DashPass,thank you dd,5
1265,8087,doordash,719972451,2022-12-18 18:53:46,Love door dash but annoyed with the drivers,idk if it is the drivers or the restaurants but my last three orders i have not gotten my drinks,3
1265,8088,doordash,719972451,2022-12-18 18:53:46,Love door dash but annoyed with the drivers,idk if it is just a weird glitch  i get my doordash credits but i was throughly annoyed this last time,3
1265,8089,doordash,719972451,2022-12-18 18:53:46,Love door dash but annoyed with the drivers,i am sick today and i ordered a protein smoothie and a side flat bread only got my flat bread and the smoothie was the most expensive part,3
1265,8090,doordash,719972451,2022-12-18 18:53:46,Love door dash but annoyed with the drivers,then i gotta use my credits pay more money again on top of the credits to get it redelivered,3
1265,8091,doordash,719972451,2022-12-18 18:53:46,Love door dash but annoyed with the drivers,they should have an option for redleievry for missing items because then the person ordering has to pay another 56 dollars on top of the credits for the missing item that you already paid to have delivered in the first place,3
1265,8092,doordash,719972451,2022-12-18 18:53:46,Love door dash but annoyed with the drivers,makes no sense,3
1266,8093,doordash,719972451,2022-12-03 14:40:19,Good but there is a huge problem,so i have been using door dash for years and generally everything is really good,4
1266,8094,doordash,719972451,2022-12-03 14:40:19,Good but there is a huge problem,but i wanted to warn people do not use express for your order,4
1266,8095,doordash,719972451,2022-12-03 14:40:19,Good but there is a huge problem,i do not know if this is with everyone but i stay in an apartment and every time i tried to use express delivery they get lost,4
1266,8096,doordash,719972451,2022-12-03 14:40:19,Good but there is a huge problem,and every time they call me and i have to come downstairs to meet them to get my food,4
1266,8097,doordash,719972451,2022-12-03 14:40:19,Good but there is a huge problem,i never have any problems with standard delivery,4
1266,8098,doordash,719972451,2022-12-03 14:40:19,Good but there is a huge problem,they find the place every time,4
1266,8099,doordash,719972451,2022-12-03 14:40:19,Good but there is a huge problem,could be just people starting out or something for the express delivery,4
1266,8100,doordash,719972451,2022-12-03 14:40:19,Good but there is a huge problem,i do not know,4
1266,8101,doordash,719972451,2022-12-03 14:40:19,Good but there is a huge problem,just stick to regular delivery for stuff,4
1266,8102,doordash,719972451,2022-12-03 14:40:19,Good but there is a huge problem,other than that,4
1266,8103,doordash,719972451,2022-12-03 14:40:19,Good but there is a huge problem,it is a good app and i get my food on time,4
1267,8104,doordash,719972451,2022-11-08 23:55:29,Love the ordering function but delivery is problematic,i use doordash and lot and i have used it for almost 3 years,4
1267,8105,doordash,719972451,2022-11-08 23:55:29,Love the ordering function but delivery is problematic,we have rarely had issues that were not the restaurants fault,4
1267,8106,doordash,719972451,2022-11-08 23:55:29,Love the ordering function but delivery is problematic,however in the last few months the map function that the app uses has been sending the dashers to the completely wrong street,4
1267,8107,doordash,719972451,2022-11-08 23:55:29,Love the ordering function but delivery is problematic,for years this was not an issue,4
1267,8108,doordash,719972451,2022-11-08 23:55:29,Love the ordering function but delivery is problematic,all of a sudden every time we order the dasher ends up calling us to say they cannot find our house and it it can sometimes be a huge hassle to get the dasher to the house,4

1268,8115,doordash,719972451,2022-10-19 13:01:25,Glossing over honesty,this means establishments are not held accountable except for a refund through the application and more people will endure the same poor results,3

1270,8125,doordash,719972451,2022-12-20 04:29:15,I shouldn't love anything this much,having apple pay as an option to pay is great as well  i do not keep a card on file but i do have apple pay,5
1270,8126,doordash,719972451,2022-12-20 04:29:15,I shouldn't love anything this much,finally the addition of grocery stores to doordash has been amazing as well,5
1270,8127,doordash,719972451,2022-12-20 04:29:15,I shouldn't love anything this much,sometimes i just do not want to go to the store and this may sound crazy to those who live in the suburb but i do not want to lose my parking spot,5
1270,8128,doordash,719972451,2022-12-20 04:29:15,I shouldn't love anything this much,street parking in the bay area may be a large reason doordash thrives,5
1271,8129,doordash,719972451,2022-12-13 19:40:55,Double Dash,just disappointed i was not reimbursed for when my thai food order of triple vegetable with beef was not reimbursed like customer support said they would,5
1271,8130,doordash,719972451,2022-12-13 19:40:55,Double Dash,we had a three way conversation with the driver myself and customer support who heard the driver say he never did pick up my thai food order,5
1271,8131,doordash,719972451,2022-12-13 19:40:55,Double Dash,customer support said wait 25 minutes and you should see the refund,5
1271,8132,doordash,719972451,2022-12-13 19:40:55,Double Dash,i thought it was safe to reorder and thought i would get a fresh remake of what i ordered,5
1271,8133,doordash,719972451,2022-12-13 19:40:55,Double Dash,two hours later when i reordered i got delivered my original order and never reimbursed,5
1271,8134,doordash,719972451,2022-12-13 19:40:55,Double Dash,i got charged twice for 2 hour old food,5
1272,8135,doordash,719972451,2022-12-08 19:13:22,Terrible customer service,wooow i have been a loyal customer for a long time and i use this service daily,1
1272,8136,doordash,719972451,2022-12-08 19:13:22,Terrible customer service,but their customer service has gone downhill recently and i have had it with them,1
1272,8137,doordash,719972451,2022-12-08 19:13:22,Terrible customer service,imagine spending 70 of your hard earned money on an order to find feathers in your food,1
1272,8138,doordash,719972451,2022-12-08 19:13:22,Terrible customer service,i threw it all away and asked for compensation since the food was not edible i was bounced around different sketchy teams of customer support that flat out told me due to the history of your account we cannot compensate you,1
1272,8139,doordash,719972451,2022-12-08 19:13:22,Terrible customer service,keep in mind for the past 100 orders i have not requested any compensation to make matters worse everytime i try to finish writing this review it starts deleting itself worst customer service ever save your money as they will steal it and go with any other app that offers similar services,1
1272,8140,doordash,719972451,2022-12-08 19:13:22,Terrible customer service,this one is not worth it,1
1273,8141,doordash,719972451,2022-10-26 21:57:40,POOR SERVICE,every single time i order anything through this app there is an issue or inconvenience,1
1273,8142,doordash,719972451,2022-10-26 21:57:40,POOR SERVICE,the only reason i am still using this app is because my money is tied up in credits that has to be used before i am able to delete this entire app,1
1273,8143,doordash,719972451,2022-10-26 21:57:40,POOR SERVICE,these drivers are poor sorry excuse for working citizens,1
1273,8144,doordash,719972451,2022-10-26 21:57:40,POOR SERVICE,they are very lazy and most are too illiterate to follow simple directions such as hand it to me,1
1273,8145,doordash,719972451,2022-10-26 21:57:40,POOR SERVICE,dashers will pick up the call but not the order,1
1273,8146,doordash,719972451,2022-10-26 21:57:40,POOR SERVICE,i have had dashers literally sitting in the parking lot high off drugs while i am waiting on my order to be delivered,1
1273,8147,doordash,719972451,2022-10-26 21:57:40,POOR SERVICE,called the merchant only for them to say they have completed my order 45 minutes ago,1
1273,8148,doordash,719972451,2022-10-26 21:57:40,POOR SERVICE,gets up and go to the place and the dasher is over dosing in the parking lot from some type of drug with my food in the car,1
1273,8149,doordash,719972451,2022-10-26 21:57:40,POOR SERVICE,these people hire anybody but refused to hire me,1
1274,8151,doordash,719972451,2022-10-20 19:58:18,Laggy and buggy,grocery stores are bugged,2
1274,8152,doordash,719972451,2022-10-20 19:58:18,Laggy and buggy,i can only order from food places with small menus but with places that have a large menumore items to load the app crashes and gets stuck on the loading animation and eventually freezesanimation and no touch control restarting redownloading different devicesi have tried 3 apple devices or different profiles do not fix this issue,2
1274,8153,doordash,719972451,2022-10-20 19:58:18,Laggy and buggy,as an app developer i know these things can happen and hope this review gets seen and fixed because this error makes me use uber eats instead when i originally just use door dash you all are losing my service so please fix this,2
1274,8154,doordash,719972451,2022-10-20 19:58:18,Laggy and buggy,i am sure it is not just me as my gf has the same issue and she completely deleted the app and exclusively uses uber eats now,2
1275,8155,doordash,719972451,2022-09-24 21:36:16,Very reoccurring customer,time and time again i order something from my town and time and time again i do not receive my full order,2

1275,8158,doordash,719972451,2022-09-24 21:36:16,Very reoccurring customer,the only solution offered by the horrible support service is a refund for your food,2
1275,8159,doordash,719972451,2022-09-24 21:36:16,Very reoccurring customer,not for the tip not for the delivery fee just the food,2
1275,8160,doordash,719972451,2022-09-24 21:36:16,Very reoccurring customer,so if i actually want my order i have to go back and spend even more on those things when it was not right the first time,2
1275,8161,doordash,719972451,2022-09-24 21:36:16,Very reoccurring customer,let me be clear when i say this has happened consostently,2
1275,8162,doordash,719972451,2022-09-24 21:36:16,Very reoccurring customer,it is one thing if things are forgotten but to pay more to have what was forgotten redelivered,2
1275,8163,doordash,719972451,2022-09-24 21:36:16,Very reoccurring customer,horrible service,2
1276,8164,doordash,719972451,2022-09-14 17:39:40,Do not use this crap,at least half of the dashers will be people too incompetent to get hired at any job,1
1276,8165,doordash,719972451,2022-09-14 17:39:40,Do not use this crap,you you will buy an 8 meal but after doordash fees and tip it will be 22,1
1276,8166,doordash,719972451,2022-09-14 17:39:40,Do not use this crap,oh but you can spend 12 a month to get rid of scummy fees but only if what you order is over 10 in food  you are better off spending that money on gas and going to get your food yourself,1
1276,8167,doordash,719972451,2022-09-14 17:39:40,Do not use this crap,i ordered a burger for me and nuggets with fries for my girlfriend we received only the fries,1
1276,8168,doordash,719972451,2022-09-14 17:39:40,Do not use this crap,doordash at least let us you refund if there is a problem only one item though  go get your food yourself,1
1276,8169,doordash,719972451,2022-09-14 17:39:40,Do not use this crap,do not overpay to have some disgusting unsanitary random stranger to handle your food,1
1276,8170,doordash,719972451,2022-09-14 17:39:40,Do not use this crap,i have had instances where the seal was broken and we suddenly have 6 fries total,1
1276,8171,doordash,719972451,2022-09-14 17:39:40,Do not use this crap,doordash will let literally anyone deliver,1
1276,8172,doordash,719972451,2022-09-14 17:39:40,Do not use this crap,it is easier to become a driver than it is to buy a gun in texas,1
1277,8173,doordash,719972451,2022-10-15 23:08:18,Does Not Handle Archiving of Old Orders Gracefully,functionally a fine app,4
1277,8174,doordash,719972451,2022-10-15 23:08:18,Does Not Handle Archiving of Old Orders Gracefully,but note to devs when you go to pull up an old order that is very old and thus probably not archived anymore it fails in an ugly way,4
1277,8175,doordash,719972451,2022-10-15 23:08:18,Does Not Handle Archiving of Old Orders Gracefully,for example rather than showing a page saying that there was an error it shows a white screen with something that someone on the backend would want to see something goes wrong to fetch order with detail,4
1277,8176,doordash,719972451,2022-10-15 23:08:18,Does Not Handle Archiving of Old Orders Gracefully,the message changes depending on the order but if you click the same order over and over the message that is shown stays the same,4
1277,8177,doordash,719972451,2022-10-15 23:08:18,Does Not Handle Archiving of Old Orders Gracefully,maybe something to fix for the next version,4
1278,8178,doordash,719972451,2022-11-05 17:18:22,Love this technology,as much i am not a fan of new technologies today but in all due reality this has been amazing just like uber eats,5
1278,8179,doordash,719972451,2022-11-05 17:18:22,Love this technology,but doordash has been allot easier to use other than uber eats,5
1278,8180,doordash,719972451,2022-11-05 17:18:22,Love this technology,especially for people like me who gets tired coming home from work cause i work graveyards and i do get tired to go anywhere,5
1278,8181,doordash,719972451,2022-11-05 17:18:22,Love this technology,i give thanks to the people who is willing to deliver food and other convenience stuff and also along with uber i am thankful for that technology as well to give people rides and from where ever they needed to be i am grateful for both feature god bless you all,5
1279,8182,doordash,719972451,2022-11-07 19:19:40,Marked up and always late,the food is excellent and delivered fast for a large fee,1
1279,8183,doordash,719972451,2022-11-07 19:19:40,Marked up and always late,they will send your favorite foods to your house at their own prices,1
1279,8184,doordash,719972451,2022-11-07 19:19:40,Marked up and always late,their prices are higher than the restaurants but if you sign up for their promotion then you can have it delivered for free kinda do not forget the extra driver charge and do not forget to add the express option to insure your driver does not take your food on a wild 30 minute ride,1
1279,8185,doordash,719972451,2022-11-07 19:19:40,Marked up and always late,oh yea and if your order gets messed up they will totally reimburse you,1
1279,8186,doordash,719972451,2022-11-07 19:19:40,Marked up and always late,but not really did your 15 waffle not come with everything like utensils butter or syrup that is okay they will give you a 110 credit towards your next rip off session,1
1279,8187,doordash,719972451,2022-11-07 19:19:40,Marked up and always late,did you accidentally order your food to a different state do not worry they will warn you that it seems like you are far away,1
1280,8189,doordash,719972451,2022-09-22 18:20:53,Why Does DD Charge More Than the Restaurant for Food??,this app works great but over the past couple of months i have noticed that everything is more expensive than the actual restaurants charge  i will literally go on the restaurants website and see their cost for the item and then on door dash it is anywhere between 36 more per item,3
1280,8190,doordash,719972451,2022-09-22 18:20:53,Why Does DD Charge More Than the Restaurant for Food??,that is ridiculous,3
1280,8191,doordash,719972451,2022-09-22 18:20:53,Why Does DD Charge More Than the Restaurant for Food??,between all of the extra fees and increase on food items it is cheaper for me to just use gas and pick up directly from the restaurant instead of going through dd,3
1280,8192,doordash,719972451,2022-09-22 18:20:53,Why Does DD Charge More Than the Restaurant for Food??,at least the restaurant will not charge the extra fees and i am a dash pass member too,3
1280,8193,doordash,719972451,2022-09-22 18:20:53,Why Does DD Charge More Than the Restaurant for Food??,is dd pocketing the difference between what the restaurant charges and what is on the app,3
1281,8195,doordash,719972451,2022-12-19 06:02:48,Such horrible customer service,i scheduled ahead of time a delivery of pizzas for a party we had planned and after the time the pizza should have arrived i received a call from door dash customer service telling me that my order would need to be canceled because it could not be fullfilled but i could try reordering the same order again which wouldve taken up to 2 hours to fulfill,1
1281,8196,doordash,719972451,2022-12-19 06:02:48,Such horrible customer service,the customer service person actually hung up on me when i inquired why i would reorder with no garuntee that it had be fulfilled,1
1281,8197,doordash,719972451,2022-12-19 06:02:48,Such horrible customer service,i have never left a bad review before but this is not the first problem i have encountered with door dash nor the first time i have been hung up on by them,1
1281,8198,doordash,719972451,2022-12-19 06:02:48,Such horrible customer service,i will not be renewing my membership and i suggest you look at other options for your food delivery service,1
1281,8199,doordash,719972451,2022-12-19 06:02:48,Such horrible customer service,this company is horrible,1
1282,8200,doordash,719972451,2022-12-09 08:45:59,I deleted for the lack of integrity,so i have been using this app for a year,1
1282,8201,doordash,719972451,2022-12-09 08:45:59,I deleted for the lack of integrity,i have been having a problem to get my order as the dasher in my area keep not delivering my order and it takes three days to get my refund,1
1282,8202,doordash,719972451,2022-12-09 08:45:59,I deleted for the lack of integrity,there is no way to contact your dasher as from one call to the customer service they stated that the number in the app is not related to dasher but to the assistant or something like that,1
1282,8203,doordash,719972451,2022-12-09 08:45:59,I deleted for the lack of integrity,it is just very easy for the dasher to submit that the order was dropped off but there is no integrity check even though technology now can detect food package using ai and machine learning,1
1282,8204,doordash,719972451,2022-12-09 08:45:59,I deleted for the lack of integrity,however it was easy to request a refund but how could they refund the wasted time,1
1282,8205,doordash,719972451,2022-12-09 08:45:59,I deleted for the lack of integrity,so i decided to eat healthy and not waste time,1
1282,8206,doordash,719972451,2022-12-09 08:45:59,I deleted for the lack of integrity,also i am a student so getting my refund in three days is a big deal to me,1

1283,8219,doordash,719972451,2022-11-14 13:13:06,100 orders,they would close the chat i would re open it and they kept shutting down the chat,1
1283,8220,doordash,719972451,2022-11-14 13:13:06,100 orders,i would expect this of a scam caller but not a big corporation,1
1283,8221,doordash,719972451,2022-11-14 13:13:06,100 orders,very garbage,1
1284,8222,doordash,719972451,2022-10-11 19:42:47,Pay your Dashers so I don't have to,it is painfully obvious that you do not pay your dashers as you should,1
1284,8223,doordash,719972451,2022-10-11 19:42:47,Pay your Dashers so I don't have to,tipping them as much as i am i feel like i am footing the paycheck,1
1284,8224,doordash,719972451,2022-10-11 19:42:47,Pay your Dashers so I don't have to,you should not suggest as much as you do and i should not have to tip like i do,1
1284,8226,doordash,719972451,2022-10-11 19:42:47,Pay your Dashers so I don't have to,at least give me the opportunity to give a tip after i receive the meal,1
1284,8227,doordash,719972451,2022-10-11 19:42:47,Pay your Dashers so I don't have to,why would i tip without knowing what the service quality is,1
1284,8228,doordash,719972451,2022-10-11 19:42:47,Pay your Dashers so I don't have to,it does not make any sense,1
1284,8229,doordash,719972451,2022-10-11 19:42:47,Pay your Dashers so I don't have to,half the time there is an issue with the order of delivery time is wrong,1
1284,8230,doordash,719972451,2022-10-11 19:42:47,Pay your Dashers so I don't have to,and i am not new here,1
1284,8231,doordash,719972451,2022-10-11 19:42:47,Pay your Dashers so I don't have to,i have spent a good portion of my income receiving food,1
1284,8232,doordash,719972451,2022-10-11 19:42:47,Pay your Dashers so I don't have to,i still love the service option but you need to adjust the cost because i can compare to other services that clearly do not try and make me feel bad about offering a tip i can afford,1
1284,8233,doordash,719972451,2022-10-11 19:42:47,Pay your Dashers so I don't have to,and a tip is for extra not for the expected service,1
1285,8234,doordash,719972451,2022-10-05 00:05:29,Good but pricy,the app is pretty good great even at times but it is getting ridiculous with the delivery fees,3
1285,8235,doordash,719972451,2022-10-05 00:05:29,Good but pricy,before it was just 5 for the extra fees on your meal but now it can range anywhere from 10 to 15 bucks with every order,3
1285,8236,doordash,719972451,2022-10-05 00:05:29,Good but pricy,the delivery drivers are great but if you at least want to give them a tip of 5 it is nearly 15 to 20 on top of your order that is already expensive depending on how much you are ordering and i usually go for the cheap stuffimagine ordering from mcdonalds for a 6 meal and end up spending 20 to 25 bucks just for one person,3
1285,8237,doordash,719972451,2022-10-05 00:05:29,Good but pricy,it can definitely be pricy if you are trying to budget and have no car to do pickups,3
1285,8238,doordash,719972451,2022-10-05 00:05:29,Good but pricy,the app is great but it definitely needs work,3
1286,8239,doordash,719972451,2022-09-27 03:20:53,There's a chance that someone can just take your food and money,i have been using doordash for a few months and it is been great,3
1286,8240,doordash,719972451,2022-09-27 03:20:53,There's a chance that someone can just take your food and money,this is the first time something bad had happened and it is made me nervous that stuff like this can happen more often so i am taking a break from this app for now,3
1286,8241,doordash,719972451,2022-09-27 03:20:53,There's a chance that someone can just take your food and money,a person named amy was supposed to give me my food that i payed 21 for and she ended up taking it,3
1286,8242,doordash,719972451,2022-09-27 03:20:53,There's a chance that someone can just take your food and money,she never moved from her spot on the map would not answer my texts and when i tried to call her it said that her phone is not in service anymore,3
1286,8243,doordash,719972451,2022-09-27 03:20:53,There's a chance that someone can just take your food and money,there was nothing else i can do besides canceling it after waiting an hour and getting 20 worth of credits for a next order on the app,3
1287,8244,doordash,719972451,2022-09-30 11:28:20,Do you want to pay a premium for the wrong food 50% of the time?!,then this is the app for you,1
1287,8245,doordash,719972451,2022-09-30 11:28:20,Do you want to pay a premium for the wrong food 50% of the time?!,did you order some nice soup and an iced coffee for lunch,1
1287,8246,doordash,719972451,2022-09-30 11:28:20,Do you want to pay a premium for the wrong food 50% of the time?!,well you you will probably receive a pizza and a small order of rice,1
1287,8247,doordash,719972451,2022-09-30 11:28:20,Do you want to pay a premium for the wrong food 50% of the time?!,did you order a late night pretzel and some coffee to get some work done,1
1287,8248,doordash,719972451,2022-09-30 11:28:20,Do you want to pay a premium for the wrong food 50% of the time?!,well congratulations on your new qtips and deodorant,1
1287,8249,doordash,719972451,2022-09-30 11:28:20,Do you want to pay a premium for the wrong food 50% of the time?!,be prepared for missing items as well like the quesadilla that was conveniently missing from my last orderin all seriousness there is probably a 50 chance you are going to get the right items and you are going to pay a premium on them,1
1287,8250,doordash,719972451,2022-09-30 11:28:20,Do you want to pay a premium for the wrong food 50% of the time?!,anyone can be a doordasher and without serious oversight and punishment for dashers nothing will ever changeuse at your own risk or use if you want to get some random food or pharmacy items,1
1287,8251,doordash,719972451,2022-09-30 11:28:20,Do you want to pay a premium for the wrong food 50% of the time?!,random is fun sometimes,1

1288,8256,doordash,719972451,2022-09-27 00:48:18,Don't use Door Dash food won't come,so to be told she cannot bring my food because i cannot direct her in spanish to my house is absolutely ridiculous,1
1288,8257,doordash,719972451,2022-09-27 00:48:18,Don't use Door Dash food won't come,door dash does not do anything to make it right,1

1288,8260,doordash,719972451,2022-09-27 00:48:18,Don't use Door Dash food won't come,they lied and said they were going to escalate the issue and see me an email,1
1288,8261,doordash,719972451,2022-09-27 00:48:18,Don't use Door Dash food won't come,both of those things were a lie,1

1289,8266,doordash,719972451,2022-12-07 17:54:04,Pretty sure the driver stole our lunch!,it is not,1
1289,8267,doordash,719972451,2022-12-07 17:54:04,Pretty sure the driver stole our lunch!,the food is nowhere in sight and the picture the driver took is of a house down the street,1
1289,8268,doordash,719972451,2022-12-07 17:54:04,Pretty sure the driver stole our lunch!,the picture does not even show the food it is just a photo of the neighbors house taken from the drivers car,1
1289,8269,doordash,719972451,2022-12-07 17:54:04,Pretty sure the driver stole our lunch!,he asked the neighbor and no one dropped any food off there,1
1289,8270,doordash,719972451,2022-12-07 17:54:04,Pretty sure the driver stole our lunch!,when he tried to reach out to customer service the agent ended the chat out of nowhere while he was trying to type his response,1

1290,8272,doordash,719972451,2022-11-30 00:21:56,Why does it refresh??,i love door dash,3
1290,8273,doordash,719972451,2022-11-30 00:21:56,Why does it refresh??,i really do,3
1290,8274,doordash,719972451,2022-11-30 00:21:56,Why does it refresh??,but when you click on a restaurant to look at their offerings and then go back to the main list ultimately the whole app refreshes and brings you to the top of the page,3
1290,8275,doordash,719972451,2022-11-30 00:21:56,Why does it refresh??,it is incredibly frustrating to then have to scroll back down to where you were,3
1290,8276,doordash,719972451,2022-11-30 00:21:56,Why does it refresh??,often times after this happening a couple times i switch to ubereats and buy through them,3
1290,8277,doordash,719972451,2022-11-30 00:21:56,Why does it refresh??,i get that maybe a restaurant or two has gone offline in that time and they are reflecting that change but why not just keep those restaurants on the page and reflect that they are closed until the user refreshes the page,3
1291,8278,doordash,719972451,2022-10-05 14:08:09,No,this has got to be one of the worst and most pathetic app i have used,1
1291,8279,doordash,719972451,2022-10-05 14:08:09,No,first off why have 50 discounts and not even take out 50 off your total order,1
1291,8280,doordash,719972451,2022-10-05 14:08:09,No,secondly why have an app as a food delivery service when yah look severely understaffed i ordered sum not too long ago and by the time my food got there it was basically frozen solid,1
1291,8281,doordash,719972451,2022-10-05 14:08:09,No,and yah really gone mean to tell me that every time i order i am gonna have cold food cause yah struggling to look for dashers when i am in the city as well like cmon now it is really pathetic on yah end for real like do not have a service like this if yah gonna keep delaying my order cause yah need to look for people to deliver only to have me wait more than 2 hrs just to have someone deliver a simple order please do not ever order using this service ever again,1
1291,8282,doordash,719972451,2022-10-05 14:08:09,No,that is why uber eats is superior i swear bro,1
1292,8283,doordash,719972451,2022-11-19 17:35:38,Good luck,if you dasher spills your drink good luck getting a replacement,2
1292,8284,doordash,719972451,2022-11-19 17:35:38,Good luck,the driver was amazing and super nice accidents happen,2
1292,8285,doordash,719972451,2022-11-19 17:35:38,Good luck,however i still wanted my drink and since i paid for it i just wanted to get it redelivered,2
1292,8286,doordash,719972451,2022-11-19 17:35:38,Good luck,they refused and told me they would give me the cost of the drink to reorder,2
1292,8287,doordash,719972451,2022-11-19 17:35:38,Good luck,what about the tax i will have to pay,2
1292,8288,doordash,719972451,2022-11-19 17:35:38,Good luck,the delivery fee i will pay because i do not meet the 12 minimum,2
1292,8289,doordash,719972451,2022-11-19 17:35:38,Good luck,what about the tip for the driver,2
1292,8290,doordash,719972451,2022-11-19 17:35:38,Good luck,it is not necessary for you to tip on the orders  excuse me,2
1292,8291,doordash,719972451,2022-11-19 17:35:38,Good luck,people do this for a living i am going to tip for someone taking time out of their day and using their gas to come and bring me a drink when i cannot physically get around well or i am very sick,2
1292,8292,doordash,719972451,2022-11-19 17:35:38,Good luck,do better door dash,2
1292,8293,doordash,719972451,2022-11-19 17:35:38,Good luck,my subscription is canceled and i will not be using for a very long time,2
1293,8294,doordash,719972451,2022-11-06 18:40:27,Best review( real n***a answer),if you want real advice take it right here it is waaaay better if you go by yourself grab your food and take it home then using this app but if you cannot go grab the food yourself use this i only rated it one star because of the tax that is thrown on here for no reason i cannot even tip the doordash driver bc 10 dollars gets added on every meal you order to sum up the story  if you absolutely cannot get the food yourself use this app but if you can then absolutely do not use this app you you will waste waay more money on tax than gas using this,1
1293,8295,doordash,719972451,2022-11-06 18:40:27,Best review( real n***a answer),this app can also just help you find other places to eat and what the menus and prices will be i keep it on my phone just in case i am ever in a situation where i have into use it but i barley ever use this app because of the money tax,1
1294,8296,doordash,719972451,2022-09-22 18:48:21,Spectacularly Bad,between the up charges the dashers who will drop your food off at the wrong house or at the driveway and not the front door and the customer service that goes through an entire script before you can get a refund for a delivery never showing up i cannot recommend this for anyone,1
1294,8297,doordash,719972451,2022-09-22 18:48:21,Spectacularly Bad,plus we need to get back to a lifestyle of picking up our own food rather than paying 40 more after charges and tips to have it brought to us,1
1294,8298,doordash,719972451,2022-09-22 18:48:21,Spectacularly Bad,on the flip side having driven for doordash and postmates in 2020 when my job was on hiatus i can heartily encourage you to support postmates if you must order delivery,1
1294,8299,doordash,719972451,2022-09-22 18:48:21,Spectacularly Bad,their drivers are treated much better and have better earning potential and it shows cause i have never had a problem with a postmates driver dropping food off at the door,1
1295,8300,doordash,719972451,2022-09-19 00:51:51,What a joke,after waiting two hours for my order i called support to get assistance and told them that my order had first and canceled for no reason and that when i called the restaurant to come pick it up myself they informed me that they had assigned a new driver to my new order,1
1295,8301,doordash,719972451,2022-09-19 00:51:51,What a joke,my driver was not the issue it was the app canceling the order without a reason and when i informed customer service of this they informed me that they can offer me a five dollar credit for my 43 order that is now pending on my account two different times because i had to redo the order,1
1295,8302,doordash,719972451,2022-09-19 00:51:51,What a joke,so two hour wait for an order that was supposed to arrive within 30 minutes and almost 90 taken out of my account until the first refund goes through and they offer me five dollars,1
1296,8303,doordash,719972451,2022-12-19 05:51:10,New Changes,disappointed in the new changes to their delivery system,2
1296,8304,doordash,719972451,2022-12-19 05:51:10,New Changes,i used to be able to rely on a timely delivery and the food was always warm and fresh,2
1296,8305,doordash,719972451,2022-12-19 05:51:10,New Changes,recently doordash has updated how they do deliveries and they will have a dasher do multiple stops and do not come  straight to me,2
1296,8306,doordash,719972451,2022-12-19 05:51:10,New Changes,now instead of the estimated 2030 minute delivery i will about 1 hour before i get my food,2
1296,8307,doordash,719972451,2022-12-19 05:51:10,New Changes,it is very frustrating because my food is coldsoggy,2
1296,8308,doordash,719972451,2022-12-19 05:51:10,New Changes,unless i add the extra fee to have it come straight to me i have to wait for low quality food that i could have gotten myself in a shorter time,2
1296,8309,doordash,719972451,2022-12-19 05:51:10,New Changes,as a loyal customer for 4 years i am very disappointed in the new way they are running their business and will no longer be using their app,2
1297,8310,doordash,719972451,2022-12-15 17:36:21,Better packaging for orders NEEDED,companies that partner with door dash should do better about providing quality and acceptable packaging for delivery orders to ensure the customers food is not tampered with,2
1297,8311,doordash,719972451,2022-12-15 17:36:21,Better packaging for orders NEEDED,door dash should include this in their policies if companys wish to partner with doordash to extend their services through delivery,2
1297,8312,doordash,719972451,2022-12-15 17:36:21,Better packaging for orders NEEDED,some places use brown packaging bags that are sealed with a sticker and stapled to ensure the food is not tampered with yet some places only place the food within a plastic bag with no stability and double tie the bag as if the dasher cannot untie the knot and tamper with the contents,2
1297,8313,doordash,719972451,2022-12-15 17:36:21,Better packaging for orders NEEDED,this should be heavily considered by the higher ups at door dash more so from a public health and safety standpoint to ensure more quality services is being provided for users of their services,2
1298,8314,doordash,719972451,2022-10-08 03:39:33,Food Delivery app,of all the food delivery services door dash is truthfully the best one you can get,5
1298,8315,doordash,719972451,2022-10-08 03:39:33,Food Delivery app,it has the best stores the best customer service and it does grocery items,5

1298,8323,doordash,719972451,2022-10-08 03:39:33,Food Delivery app,i cannot recommend it enough,5
1299,8324,doordash,719972451,2022-12-10 22:56:58,Not Worth It,i used doordash all the time and had no problems until recently,1
1299,8325,doordash,719972451,2022-12-10 22:56:58,Not Worth It,i even purchased the dashpass at one point since i used it so frequently,1
1299,8326,doordash,719972451,2022-12-10 22:56:58,Not Worth It,however recent their app has had nothing but issues,1
1299,8327,doordash,719972451,2022-12-10 22:56:58,Not Worth It,it crashes all the time it always reloads and says it is too busy and i am frequently left with incorrect orders or missing items,1
1299,8328,doordash,719972451,2022-12-10 22:56:58,Not Worth It,the most ridiculous part of all is the prices and fees,1
1299,8329,doordash,719972451,2022-12-10 22:56:58,Not Worth It,it is just not worth it for the poor service,1
1299,8330,doordash,719972451,2022-12-10 22:56:58,Not Worth It,if you are left without your dinner like i was last weekend because it was not delivered with the rest of my food all you can get is a refund,1
1299,8331,doordash,719972451,2022-12-10 22:56:58,Not Worth It,then they charge you the same fees again to have it delivered,1
1299,8332,doordash,719972451,2022-12-10 22:56:58,Not Worth It,between the poor app performance and the lack of customer care i will be taking my business elsewhere,1
1300,8333,doordash,719972451,2022-09-16 22:44:46,Paying for Instant delivery is a scam!!,as a longtime doordash user it is absolutely appalling for the company to constantly raise rates on delivery service by introducing things such as instant delivery,2
1300,8334,doordash,719972451,2022-09-16 22:44:46,Paying for Instant delivery is a scam!!,this capitalistic mindset from the business is creating an unstable experience for customers who wants to use the service at an affordable price,2
1300,8335,doordash,719972451,2022-09-16 22:44:46,Paying for Instant delivery is a scam!!,most people who use the regular service are paying up to 10 in fees and tips which was not the case a few months ago,2
1300,8336,doordash,719972451,2022-09-16 22:44:46,Paying for Instant delivery is a scam!!,while using the new standard service my food is arriving much later and colder than usually,2
1300,8337,doordash,719972451,2022-09-16 22:44:46,Paying for Instant delivery is a scam!!,as a consumer it is starting to be apparent that i am better off buying my items at the location instead of using doordash,2
1300,8338,doordash,719972451,2022-09-16 22:44:46,Paying for Instant delivery is a scam!!,or just use a different service all together,2
1301,8339,doordash,719972451,2022-10-29 23:25:18,Not getting my food 2 times in a row,door dash was very reliable at first but for the last couple orders it is been awful,1
1301,8340,doordash,719972451,2022-10-29 23:25:18,Not getting my food 2 times in a row,my first order was for a wing place and i typed my order in and made sure everything was right opened it to check 99 of my food i had on there was gone and it was already here before i found out so at delivery i got one thing i order potato wedges and nothing else,1
1301,8341,doordash,719972451,2022-10-29 23:25:18,Not getting my food 2 times in a row,then again today i received the wrong order again,1

1301,8343,doordash,719972451,2022-10-29 23:25:18,Not getting my food 2 times in a row,yes ik sounds bad ordering it like that but i am 17 and not allowed to really cook a lot of things and my moms out of town on a weekend vacation,1
1301,8344,doordash,719972451,2022-10-29 23:25:18,Not getting my food 2 times in a row,it is very unbecoming bc every experience before was absolutely wonderful whys it going bad now,1

1302,8350,doordash,719972451,2022-10-29 19:44:46,I love DoorDash! But….,number two is that sometimes they mix the orders or something is missing from the meal,4
1302,8351,doordash,719972451,2022-10-29 19:44:46,I love DoorDash! But….,also if youwe get someones elses order what if we are allergic to their food or their allergic to our food,4
1302,8352,doordash,719972451,2022-10-29 19:44:46,I love DoorDash! But….,that might be a problem,4
1302,8353,doordash,719972451,2022-10-29 19:44:46,I love DoorDash! But….,but other than that i love doordash and i would recommend getting doordash,4
1303,8355,doordash,719972451,2022-10-22 07:12:26,Liars. They'll Steal Your Money,i ordered food tonight and it was not delivered to the correct address,1
1303,8356,doordash,719972451,2022-10-22 07:12:26,Liars. They'll Steal Your Money,not only did the customer service reps deny that my order was not received but they literally went in and changed my address to coincide with their story being that i had given the wrong address,1
1303,8357,doordash,719972451,2022-10-22 07:12:26,Liars. They'll Steal Your Money,that was not true because i ordered the same meal the day before to the correct address and pressed reorder and confirmed my meal without making any changes,1
1303,8358,doordash,719972451,2022-10-22 07:12:26,Liars. They'll Steal Your Money,then they ended the conversation when i was trying to speak with a supervisor,1
1303,8359,doordash,719972451,2022-10-22 07:12:26,Liars. They'll Steal Your Money,this company is deceitful,1
1303,8360,doordash,719972451,2022-10-22 07:12:26,Liars. They'll Steal Your Money,i was a loyal customer for a long time and deleted my account tonight because they not only lied but also refused to refund me my money after i did not receive my order,1
1303,8361,doordash,719972451,2022-10-22 07:12:26,Liars. They'll Steal Your Money,terrible customer service  the worst of them all,1
1304,8362,doordash,719972451,2022-10-08 17:34:09,"Fantastic App, however strange extra charges",when you order delivery they tack on fees and taxes onto your order,4
1304,8363,doordash,719972451,2022-10-08 17:34:09,"Fantastic App, however strange extra charges",you would imagine this would include the taxes on your food however everything on the menu is also raised a few dollars for some apparent reason,4
1304,8364,doordash,719972451,2022-10-08 17:34:09,"Fantastic App, however strange extra charges",the food and service is great there are discounts promo codes and such,4
1304,8365,doordash,719972451,2022-10-08 17:34:09,"Fantastic App, however strange extra charges",but i do not want to pay 30 dollars for 4 chicken sandwiches from popeyes,4
1304,8366,doordash,719972451,2022-10-08 17:34:09,"Fantastic App, however strange extra charges",i might as well get chick fila at that point,4
1304,8367,doordash,719972451,2022-10-08 17:34:09,"Fantastic App, however strange extra charges",otherwise fantastic app reaches out to multiple restaurants that are difficult to get too as well as offering a premium that reduces your taxes,4
1305,8368,doordash,719972451,2022-09-23 17:47:14,Don't use DoorDash,i ordered food then double dashed a bag a chips from another store,1
1305,8369,doordash,719972451,2022-09-23 17:47:14,Don't use DoorDash,instead of them having one dasher do the delivery they had two different dashers,1
1305,8370,doordash,719972451,2022-09-23 17:47:14,Don't use DoorDash,but the first dasher received both orders and when he went to get the chips my order for him disappeared because they sent the second dasher for the chips,1
1305,8371,doordash,719972451,2022-09-23 17:47:14,Don't use DoorDash,i spoke with the first dasher and he said he spoke with doordash and they told him he canceled the order himself which he did not they sent a second dasher and just lied to him,1
1305,8372,doordash,719972451,2022-09-23 17:47:14,Don't use DoorDash,not to mention the second dasher delivered the chips to the wrong address and doordash refused to refund me for it,1
1305,8373,doordash,719972451,2022-09-23 17:47:14,Don't use DoorDash,i canceled my dash pass and will never use this app again,1
1305,8374,doordash,719972451,2022-09-23 17:47:14,Don't use DoorDash,they refused to take the blame or solve the problem your better off with postmates or uber eats,1

1306,8376,doordash,719972451,2022-12-07 18:01:04,"The system and ""membership"" is worth it",the only downside is that doordash does not do traditional grocery stores at least in my area,5
1306,8377,doordash,719972451,2022-12-07 18:01:04,"The system and ""membership"" is worth it",otherwise enough businesses in my area work with doordash to make paying the yearly subscription worth it,5
1306,8378,doordash,719972451,2022-12-07 18:01:04,"The system and ""membership"" is worth it",i order dinner for me the kids my extended familyand i especially like to order chocolate late at night from walgreens,5
1306,8379,doordash,719972451,2022-12-07 18:01:04,"The system and ""membership"" is worth it",if i really want cookies but the kids are already asleep single momi rely on doordash and dashers in my community for little things to help my daily schedule,5
1306,8380,doordash,719972451,2022-12-07 18:01:04,"The system and ""membership"" is worth it",thanks to dashers especially,5

1307,8383,doordash,719972451,2022-09-13 03:36:35,Fantastic Service BUT.,but for my order at least it is insane that if i were to go and pick up my order myself it would have been 10,5
1307,8384,doordash,719972451,2022-09-13 03:36:35,Fantastic Service BUT.,my order with doordash is close to 30,5
1307,8385,doordash,719972451,2022-09-13 03:36:35,Fantastic Service BUT.,inflation has screwed all of us,5
1307,8386,doordash,719972451,2022-09-13 03:36:35,Fantastic Service BUT.,this feeds in to the memes about doordash that a 5 meal costs 60 hahahah again this is not a negative review i am fully happy with your service i suppose this is just a comment about the times that we are living in,5
1307,8387,doordash,719972451,2022-09-13 03:36:35,Fantastic Service BUT.,have a wonderful evening and i hope doordash lives on another day,5
1308,8388,doordash,719972451,2022-12-06 03:36:46,Takes out YOUR money for dasher's mistakes,i made a large orders for grocery i keep missing half the items because of them being out of stock and i still got charged over 50 than the bill i received from target,1
1308,8389,doordash,719972451,2022-12-06 03:36:46,Takes out YOUR money for dasher's mistakes,the customer support were only somewhat helpful and in the end i lost about 10 when i tally all up,1
1308,8390,doordash,719972451,2022-12-06 03:36:46,Takes out YOUR money for dasher's mistakes,it feels like you are always overcharged for the bill you get apart from the service and the tips and this is not fair considering i am already a member,1

1309,8398,doordash,719972451,2022-11-13 17:45:05,You get what you get and they don't make it up to you,like imagine putting your entire meal in a bucket and putting it in one of the paint mixers that shakes it to ensure it is well mixed,1

1323,8495,doordash,719972451,2022-10-31 11:05:11,Disappointed,she politely said she cannot help me and that it was peculiar that there was no picture taken or notes from dasher,1
1323,8496,doordash,719972451,2022-10-31 11:05:11,Disappointed,guess i am out the 50 bucks and inflated tip,1

1324,8499,doordash,719972451,2022-09-22 23:04:32,Cancelled orders,most of the orders i have placed on the app had been cancelled because the restaurants had supposedly been closed sometimes the restaurants are actually still open or a driver will arrive at the restaurant and it will be closed,1
1324,8500,doordash,719972451,2022-09-22 23:04:32,Cancelled orders,how is the app not aware of the hours of the locations that they service,1
1324,8501,doordash,719972451,2022-09-22 23:04:32,Cancelled orders,and how come it often lets me add menu items toy cart and then tell me after that the place is closed,1

1325,8506,doordash,719972451,2022-10-02 21:02:42,Deleting the app,i was a regular and multiple times a day user and it just happens too often that the wrong food shows up and they do not do anything but refund you for the missing item and that does not really help you when you were counting on the meal and somebody is sitting there without their food,5
1325,8507,doordash,719972451,2022-10-02 21:02:42,Deleting the app,if these services cannot put some short quality control in place to make sure that you actually get the food you order then it is never gonna work longterm i am done,5

1328,8531,doordash,719972451,2022-12-06 14:37:32,Never received product and won't issue a refund,told me i would be getting a refund and a confirmation would be sent in 24 hours,1
1328,8532,doordash,719972451,2022-12-06 14:37:32,Never received product and won't issue a refund,after 48 nothing,1
1328,8533,doordash,719972451,2022-12-06 14:37:32,Never received product and won't issue a refund,i reached out about my refund to which i was told due to their policy they do not refund orders not received,1
1328,8534,doordash,719972451,2022-12-06 14:37:32,Never received product and won't issue a refund,i do not feel this is right and i will not be using them anymore and i caution others of this policy,1
1329,8535,doordash,719972451,2022-11-11 14:48:03,Honestly its pretty bad,ive been using door dash for over a year now and have not placed a single order that didnt have any problems,2
1329,8536,doordash,719972451,2022-11-11 14:48:03,Honestly its pretty bad,there were multiple times where they could not find a dasher and my order was set back about a half hour an hour,2
1329,8537,doordash,719972451,2022-11-11 14:48:03,Honestly its pretty bad,also the cancellation to credits only works if you have the dash pass so i did end up lossing over 40 on an order because of that,2
1329,8538,doordash,719972451,2022-11-11 14:48:03,Honestly its pretty bad,the delivery time is always way off and the items in the order are almost always wrong,2
1329,8539,doordash,719972451,2022-11-11 14:48:03,Honestly its pretty bad,not to mention they leave out and up charge everything on menus,2
1329,8540,doordash,719972451,2022-11-11 14:48:03,Honestly its pretty bad,im overall very disappointed knowing that grub hub and uber eats are about 10x more accurate and overall much better,2
1330,8541,doordash,719972451,2022-11-08 01:47:49,They literally stole my money.,i use doordash almost every other day and have been a loyal customer from quite sometime,1
1330,8542,doordash,719972451,2022-11-08 01:47:49,They literally stole my money.,but unfortunately my recent experience has been abysmal,1
1330,8543,doordash,719972451,2022-11-08 01:47:49,They literally stole my money.,may be they do not care saphire preferred subscribers as much as the normal dashpass subscribers as i see a change in their behavior since i moved to this new subscription,1
1330,8544,doordash,719972451,2022-11-08 01:47:49,They literally stole my money.,i ordered food the other day the dasher arrived half an hour later than originally estimated doordash time and then he tried to hand over food which was clearly not mine,1
1330,8545,doordash,719972451,2022-11-08 01:47:49,They literally stole my money.,he informed me that the food vendor has not provided any receipt as well,1
1330,8546,doordash,719972451,2022-11-08 01:47:49,They literally stole my money.,i rejected the food saying that it is not the food i ordered and immediately contacted the support,1
1330,8547,doordash,719972451,2022-11-08 01:47:49,They literally stole my money.,that took a wild turn where i started getting bizzare replies like we will get back to you in 24 hours,1
1330,8548,doordash,719972451,2022-11-08 01:47:49,They literally stole my money.,they literally left me hungry and had to get food elsewhere,1
1330,8549,doordash,719972451,2022-11-08 01:47:49,They literally stole my money.,later i got a strange email saying exceeded recent compensations,1
1330,8550,doordash,719972451,2022-11-08 01:47:49,They literally stole my money.,i personally never asked me to compensate for anything before,1
1330,8551,doordash,719972451,2022-11-08 01:47:49,They literally stole my money.,the worst thing is there was absolutely no investigation as what happened to my order,1
1330,8552,doordash,719972451,2022-11-08 01:47:49,They literally stole my money.,in any case i did not get my food and i lost my money,1
1330,8553,doordash,719972451,2022-11-08 01:47:49,They literally stole my money.,i am gutted,1
1331,8554,doordash,719972451,2022-10-10 12:24:04,beware no food arrived but no refund,i never leave reviews on apps,1
1331,8555,doordash,719972451,2022-10-10 12:24:04,beware no food arrived but no refund,i switched to door dash because i was having issues with uber eats and thought i would give it a try,1
1331,8556,doordash,719972451,2022-10-10 12:24:04,beware no food arrived but no refund,i have had a few recent issue with my orderslike items not arriving that i reported,1
1331,8557,doordash,719972451,2022-10-10 12:24:04,beware no food arrived but no refund,no issue arose,1
1331,8558,doordash,719972451,2022-10-10 12:24:04,beware no food arrived but no refund,then a meal completely did not show up 60 paid and i reported it and they stated they cannot refund because they do not have to it is stated in the fine print,1
1331,8559,doordash,719972451,2022-10-10 12:24:04,beware no food arrived but no refund,because i had reported too many issues recently not to any fault of my own they will not issue a refund,1
1331,8560,doordash,719972451,2022-10-10 12:24:04,beware no food arrived but no refund,basically theft for no service,1
1331,8561,doordash,719972451,2022-10-10 12:24:04,beware no food arrived but no refund,im shocked,1
1331,8562,doordash,719972451,2022-10-10 12:24:04,beware no food arrived but no refund,ordering with no guarantees of food but definitely guarantee of spending monday,1
1331,8563,doordash,719972451,2022-10-10 12:24:04,beware no food arrived but no refund,despite the set backs i had with uber eats they always made sure they addressed issues that arose,1
1332,8564,doordash,719972451,2022-11-01 17:25:49,Expensive and Souless,a double edge sword,3
1332,8565,doordash,719972451,2022-11-01 17:25:49,Expensive and Souless,can be very convenient but it orders are not correct no attempt is made to resolve the issue besides an automated credit,3
1332,8566,doordash,719972451,2022-11-01 17:25:49,Expensive and Souless,confusing when dealing with issues do you you deal with dd automatic forms or call the restaurant,3
1332,8567,doordash,719972451,2022-11-01 17:25:49,Expensive and Souless,significantly more expensive than calling in an order,3
1332,8568,doordash,719972451,2022-11-01 17:25:49,Expensive and Souless,prices are increased  fees,3
1332,8569,doordash,719972451,2022-11-01 17:25:49,Expensive and Souless,ultimately i deleted my account due to the lack of issue resolution as many drivers leave food outside or missing items,3
1332,8570,doordash,719972451,2022-11-01 17:25:49,Expensive and Souless,there is a particularly large issue where most restaurants do not list there condiments so even if you call and request them they will often not arrive with your meal,3
1333,8571,doordash,719972451,2022-10-11 18:06:19,Never goes as planned,something always goes wrong with every order,1
1333,8572,doordash,719972451,2022-10-11 18:06:19,Never goes as planned,often it takes 2x as long as the original estimate to get the food,1
1333,8573,doordash,719972451,2022-10-11 18:06:19,Never goes as planned,other times drivers will leave food at the completely wrong location,1
1333,8574,doordash,719972451,2022-10-11 18:06:19,Never goes as planned,most recently the driver texted me to say the restaurant never got the order and i have to cancel and retryfrom the users perspective it is pretty clear heres my order heres the money please bring it to my location,1
1333,8575,doordash,719972451,2022-10-11 18:06:19,Never goes as planned,on the backend it is an absolute disaster of restaurants and drivers getting paid way too little to put any effort in and the result is something goes wrongorder directly from the restaurant when you can,1
1333,8576,doordash,719972451,2022-10-11 18:06:19,Never goes as planned,pick it up yourself when you can,1
1333,8577,doordash,719972451,2022-10-11 18:06:19,Never goes as planned,use doordash as a last result and keep your expectations low,1
1334,8578,doordash,719972451,2022-10-06 02:07:07,Horrible Customer Support,i have used door dash for years in college but recently it seems every order i have is missing at least one item,1
1334,8579,doordash,719972451,2022-10-06 02:07:07,Horrible Customer Support,this might not be an issue for people who have endless time because that is what you need to get through their gauntlet of employees all telling you the same few lines of how sorry they are,1
1334,8580,doordash,719972451,2022-10-06 02:07:07,Horrible Customer Support,honestly i have discovered it is best to just accept whatever automated deal they offer because that is all their going to give even after a 2 hour text conversation,1
1334,8581,doordash,719972451,2022-10-06 02:07:07,Horrible Customer Support,not to mention they did nothing when i was verbally harassed by one of their drivers,1
1334,8582,doordash,719972451,2022-10-06 02:07:07,Horrible Customer Support,i am sure he is still out driving and threatening even more customers,1
1334,8583,doordash,719972451,2022-10-06 02:07:07,Horrible Customer Support,if you have this app uninstall it,1
1334,8584,doordash,719972451,2022-10-06 02:07:07,Horrible Customer Support,if you are considering getting it do not,1
1335,8585,doordash,719972451,2022-09-11 12:34:11,HORRIBLE experience !!,the app is only good for delivering food and the food at most times is not even worth it which has nothing to do with the app itself but this app is so money hungry and greedy that if you do have a mistake with your order or your doordasher is unavailable to complete it you can only get a refund in tips and not the full price,1
1335,8586,doordash,719972451,2022-09-11 12:34:11,HORRIBLE experience !!,also i just accidentally spent 96 on a yearly subscription that i now have to use because i cannot contact them to get a refund or switch it to the monthly subscription like i wanted it,1
1335,8587,doordash,719972451,2022-09-11 12:34:11,HORRIBLE experience !!,i honestly hate this app at this point and have had many many issues with it i do not recommend it to anyone anymore and i cannot wait for my subscription to be up so i never have to use it again,1
1336,8588,doordash,719972451,2022-12-14 08:15:52,Terrible performance issues,i have reported this issue multiple times with no response besides your halfbaked outsourced customer support that can barely understand the issue because of their english skills,2
1336,8589,doordash,719972451,2022-12-14 08:15:52,Terrible performance issues,convenience stores do not load,2
1336,8590,doordash,719972451,2022-12-14 08:15:52,Terrible performance issues,any convenience store whether it is walgreens 711 dashmart does not matter,2
1336,8591,doordash,719972451,2022-12-14 08:15:52,Terrible performance issues,the screen will freeze up go white load stuff in at a painfully slow rate then crash,2
1336,8592,doordash,719972451,2022-12-14 08:15:52,Terrible performance issues,it is not my phone because everything works just fine even while the app is frozen,2
1336,8593,doordash,719972451,2022-12-14 08:15:52,Terrible performance issues,i have tried every piece of advice from both doordash and third parties online,2
1336,8594,doordash,719972451,2022-12-14 08:15:52,Terrible performance issues,after reading through recent reviews i am not the only one dealing with this,2
1336,8595,doordash,719972451,2022-12-14 08:15:52,Terrible performance issues,figure it out bros,2
1337,8596,doordash,719972451,2022-11-11 17:41:58,Horrible Customer Service,i made an order for breakfast over 30 minutes before the menu would change,1
1337,8597,doordash,719972451,2022-11-11 17:41:58,Horrible Customer Service,got confirmation right away from the restaurant,1
1337,8598,doordash,719972451,2022-11-11 17:41:58,Horrible Customer Service,it took another 20 minutes to be notified that they did not have a dasher in the area,1
1337,8599,doordash,719972451,2022-11-11 17:41:58,Horrible Customer Service,probably something you should have before you allow someone to put in the order,1
1337,8600,doordash,719972451,2022-11-11 17:41:58,Horrible Customer Service,another 40 minutes go by and i get informed that they cannot process my order at all because breakfast time was over,1
1337,8601,doordash,719972451,2022-11-11 17:41:58,Horrible Customer Service,all i got from the customer service was that my order was cancelled,1
1337,8602,doordash,719972451,2022-11-11 17:41:58,Horrible Customer Service,there needs to be some other reimbursement than just giving the payment back and there needs to be some way for you to ensure there is a dasher before someone can put in an order,1

1339,8612,doordash,719972451,2022-11-04 23:44:05,Cold Food,when it got here a third of the order was missing,1
1339,8613,doordash,719972451,2022-11-04 23:44:05,Cold Food,used the chat function in the app and the response was essentially we do not care that you are family is still hungry,1
1339,8614,doordash,719972451,2022-11-04 23:44:05,Cold Food,heres a few bucks worth of refund,1

1339,8617,doordash,719972451,2022-11-04 23:44:05,Cold Food,there is not going to be a next time,1
1339,8618,doordash,719972451,2022-11-04 23:44:05,Cold Food,the app works fine,1
1339,8619,doordash,719972451,2022-11-04 23:44:05,Cold Food,the service is the issue,1
1339,8620,doordash,719972451,2022-11-04 23:44:05,Cold Food,doordash let us it is drivers take on multiple deliveries at once so it is not uncommon for your food to ride around in the drivers vehicle for 2030 minutes,1
1339,8621,doordash,719972451,2022-11-04 23:44:05,Cold Food,by the time it arrives it is lukewarm at best,1
1339,8622,doordash,719972451,2022-11-04 23:44:05,Cold Food,also you need to make it to where the customer can tip the driver after delivery,1
1339,8623,doordash,719972451,2022-11-04 23:44:05,Cold Food,tipping beforehand based on the hope that your food will arrive is not gratuity,1
1340,8624,doordash,719972451,2022-10-09 01:51:21,Horrible experience!,if i could give them zero stars i would,1
1340,8625,doordash,719972451,2022-10-09 01:51:21,Horrible experience!,i placed a big order today through the restaurant online delivery service and when i received my food and opened my containers the delivery driver put it upon himself to eat my food and leave the scraps in the containers and still delivered it to me and took my tips,1
1340,8626,doordash,719972451,2022-10-09 01:51:21,Horrible experience!,i contacted the restaurant first and then contacted door dash and the door dash customer service department said that he would put a ticket in with the restaurant to refund my money which right there i have an issue with because it was not the restaurants fault that door dash delivery guy deron w of indianapolis indiana decided to eat my food and he said well we will put it in for him to never deliver to your address again he shouldnt even be delivering to anyones address,1
1341,8627,doordash,719972451,2022-09-28 18:08:39,Inconsistent & Misleading,the double dash adding on to an order from an additional vendor never works,2
1341,8628,doordash,719972451,2022-09-28 18:08:39,Inconsistent & Misleading,also i have entered my id into the app and verified that is correct multiple times,2
1341,8629,doordash,719972451,2022-09-28 18:08:39,Inconsistent & Misleading,still every single alcohol order ends up taking the delivery person ages to enter and half the time the app crashes on them halfway through and they have to start over,2
1341,8630,doordash,719972451,2022-09-28 18:08:39,Inconsistent & Misleading,so basically i end up paying twice the delivery fees and watch a complete stranger take every bit of information from my id which is already loaded into the app every time an order involves alcohol,2
1341,8631,doordash,719972451,2022-09-28 18:08:39,Inconsistent & Misleading,to add to the frustration the two times i reported mistakes in my order not a single thing was done to correct or refund,2
1342,8632,doordash,719972451,2022-09-21 22:07:25,"Good restaurant options, terrible interface",every time i use doordash on my laptop there is a 30 second lag between click and the action going through,2
1342,8633,doordash,719972451,2022-09-21 22:07:25,"Good restaurant options, terrible interface",sometimes i click add an item and it does not work,2
1342,8634,doordash,719972451,2022-09-21 22:07:25,"Good restaurant options, terrible interface",i have dash credits but wanted to use my credit card to pay for a meal and the app  website would not let me,2
1342,8635,doordash,719972451,2022-09-21 22:07:25,"Good restaurant options, terrible interface",overall horrible interface design,2
1342,8636,doordash,719972451,2022-09-21 22:07:25,"Good restaurant options, terrible interface",not to mention they not only charge extra fees but also raise the price you see on the menu from the actual price the restaurant charges,2
1342,8637,doordash,719972451,2022-09-21 22:07:25,"Good restaurant options, terrible interface",all things considered you pay like 810 more on each order because of doordash,2
