An hour after the delivery time which already was an hour! 2 hrs! The driver made at least FIVE other deliveries and she‚Äôs not done yet. I‚Äôm not paying extra per order to have my meal come straight to me. She was at the restaurant quickly to pick my food up but then delivered to so many others!
2. This is not the drivers fault. If they agree to accept every delivery then it is what it is. It‚Äôs hit or miss if your food will be 20 mins or 2 hours. For as much as you pay per order so everyone profits, it‚Äôs not worth waiting so long for the order. And guaranteed it‚Äôll be nice and cold. üò† or something will be missing.

You can‚Äôt even eat and enjoy food when your child‚Äôs doesn‚Äôt come or has crap on it that you didn‚Äôt order!!
3. The area to leave directions to the house is way too small.

Ordering is SO easy, from a growing number of participating top fast food, healthy and top-notch restaurants. It IS a little pricier but the minimal extra cost is WELL WORTH IT!
