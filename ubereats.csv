2022-09-19 02:16:38,"I used Uber Eats for the first time a month ago. When I received my food, it had multiple pieces of hair in it. After contacting Uber eats immediately- with proof of calls and emails they asked me to replace the order and would remove the charges. After countless times they did not remove both charges or fees totaling of over $100 because I now had to place the order twice. Over 5-7 calls with customer service the issue was never resolved and the service reps repeat themselves countless times over and over to apologize but have zero idea how to communicate or fix the issue. I asked for a supervisor and she said they’d contact me in a few business days and did not. After going to an event and speaking to a representative they offered me a $30 gift card which I tried to use tonight. After adding it to my account and placing the order the app said not available. Again, I called customer service and she asked me to delete the app and redownload it. Now the promo is gone if my $30 and over 30 minutes on the phone she asks me to wait 1-3 hours to figure out the issue. So again you have taken my money with no service and terrible customer service. Now the restaurant is closed and I have no gift card. I would not recommend this company to any individual and their customer service reps need more training assist customers oppose to continuously apologizing. I have had two horrible experiences and this company in my eyes just takes your money.",1,False,Karissa Stefanou,Terrible application and customer service,ubereats,1058959277,
2022-09-30 01:03:59,"Use one of their many competitors. While traveling to celebrate Rosh Hashana, I attempted to use the “schedule ahead” service for about five meals & one small grocery order to be delivered to my hotel front desk over the two days. The first night I had ordered two, samosas that I planned to eat for breakfast & an entree from another restaurant. Both said they had been delivered, and I had been charged for both, but the hotel only had one. The driver of the entrée left a note that he couldn’t find the place. Apparently that doesn’t matter & I had to pay for it anyway because I ordered it in advance (the order was placed over two days from delivery). Absolutely no recourse for a refund. And I didn’t have dinner. I ordered a small grocery order for the following morning, water and 2 bottled coffees to be delivered by 8:20 am so that I could receive it before I left for services. By 8:45 it hadn’t arrived. I pushed the help button a number of times- BY THE WAY THERE IS APPARENTLY A HEFTY CHARGE FOR ASKING FOR ASSISTANCE FOR A SCREWED UP ORDER. So if you do make the mistake of downloading this app, don’t push that button. I had another order for lunch that was supposed to come that afternoon but was canceled with the explanation that “the restaurant couldn’t get your order together, sorry”. It was at that point I canceled all remaining orders, 3 or 4, switched to Grubhub and had zero problems. I’ll not likely ever Uber anything again.

2022-11-30 15:05:49,"I hate this app and have officially stopped using it after being played for the last time. For a month now, I have a petty neighbor because he beats on his girlfriend and I defend her by calling the police or telling our landlord. So I’m retaliation l, he’s stealing my stuff: groceries, deliveries and my food. I’ve told this app about what was going on and why I was having to recive so many refunds this month and even told them about the police report I’ve made because of all of this. They deleted my account…..their “customer service” calls me a lier and ends the chat. Now they are claiming I have multiple accounts. I’m sorry that people scam you guys a lot but that isn’t every case. I barely order out anymore because of what my neighbor is doing. I ordered maybe 3 times and each time he’s stolen it. I’ve even had a driver last night just not even deliver my food and THEY REFUSED TO REFUND ME! I sent a picture of the driver pretending to drop off me food, pick it up and leave with it (yes I tried to stop him but I’m 7 months pregnant, can’t really move that fast) all I wanted is my money back and I was made to seem like I was a liar and a theft. So I don’t recommend this app at all, honestly I don’t recommend any of these “delivery apps” DoorDash allows too many thefts, ubereats refuses to listen to their customers and grubhub is ridiculously expensive.",1,False,QueenQuannie❤️,Thanks for letting me get robbed multiple times and refusing to help,ubereats,1058959277,
2022-11-26 23:18:08,"This app worked fine for a while, then it started to involve some operations that failed the customer satisfaction for sure. I just ordered a dinner a couple of days ago and everything was just fine until minutes after the order was placed and almost ready to deliver. So it happened that I opened the app to check order status and my order was canceled, and the stated argument was that I called the restaurant to cancel the order over phone. Besides that Uber customer service told me when chatting that they were sorry and my $ can’t be refunded because I have canceled too many orders recently which was totally false and not demonstrated. Then #1 how is it possible that Uber may allow a customer to cancel and order over phone that he placed online through the app instead of canceling using the app, and #2 how is that you can tell me I won’t receive full refund for a non-demonstrated action. Guys you need to improve your operations or if this continues happening you will totally lost many clients. I uninstalled the app and hope to find some other new app or an entrepreneur who can do a little better with less complications because this is a difficult time to waste $ for no good reason.

2022-12-12 15:55:05,So as of today I deleted this app and I’m no longer giving my business to Uber for them to steal from me. I ordered an item from a restaurant mango’s grill Keller but on the same day i decided to cancel it and order something else from the same restaurant. Upon my cancellation the app told me it would be a standard 4-7 business days for my refund to be processed so I was alright waiting but it was already 5 days and I had not received my refund so I decided to follow up and see what the hold up was just for Uber to transfer me over and over and end up not resolving my issue just to receive an email that I was not eligible for a refund. I tried to call and a customer service agent from Uber notifies me that because it was past 48hrs of me contacting uber about my refund that they would not issue it back to me because they have ‘procedure’s’ in place to be followed. I am not going to get my refund because I followed the process that the app told me to but apparently I was supposed to call Uber to cancel the order for me. How does this make sense? Why are there not steps on the app then to be user friendly and also give out information about cancellation and what not. This app has left a bad taste in my mouth and please be careful anyone using the app. This is daylight theft. Save your money and go get your orders to go or dine-in. My two cents.

2022-11-13 21:23:39,"I cannot believe what just happened, Uber eats randomly charged me a 30$ “authorization fee” (this” fee” was only labeled after hours trying to get someone to help me), right as I was placing my order- so when I agreed to it I was under the impression I was saying okay to my order being placed. I was placing an order around the same price, slightly higher than this “fee”, which at the time I assumed it was the discount being applied like the button I clicked on, said would be applied. It goes through, and when I go to check my orders eta- no such record of the order has been placed but the money sure has been taken out of my account! Customer service pretended to check on my order then claimed they were transferring me to someone with more resources than they currently had, and ended the chat with me. No transfer was made, no contact was attempted. So I go through the process again- this time I am told to check my email. All the while I am out the amount of my order and no order has been placed and no one is offering me any type of solution. I check my email and about an hour later I get the explanation that this is an authorization fee that will be released in 3-10 days.

2022-10-21 00:52:53,"I like the convenience of using Uber Eats, however, there’s been too many times where my order was either missing items or incorrectly prepared. Now in this situation, of course most people will contact support for assistance, to request a refund of those missing items or incorrect order. The problem with this is, Uber gives a cap on how much they will refund over a period of time. 

Now, I understand there’s limits, due to help prevent abuse, but if you request a picture and description of the issue and it’s provided, then something should be done to help the consumer. Say I ordered a chicken sandwich and received a hamburger, and I clearly show that I received something different, then saying you can’t provide a refund and you’ll reach out to the merchant to help prevent it from happening again, doesn’t help the consumer. This penalizes the consumer and makes them less likely to use the service again, due to something outside of their control.

Some people spend a lot of money on delivery food to have food missing or incorrectly prepared food, only to be stuck with no solution from the service provider. I nearly signed up for an annual subscription, I’m soooo glad I didn’t. Be careful for anyone that does sign up for the annual plan to save money.

2022-11-19 23:15:04,"I wrote this review a year and a half ago. I STILL cannot understand for the life of me why this broken app gets anywhere near 5 stars. Even the bad reviews have five stars. I am at a loss. This time I came back to point out that they removed the option to add a note of instructions. Now I can’t tell them to hold the lettuce. Maybe it’s all the people in the US, because Uber would rather invade and colonialize Latin America than actually try to fix their app. It’s well and truly baffling that they get this much praise. One example is that the app can’t figure out where I am nor where places are. Either it puts the delivery guy a block away and doesn’t let me fix the location or the application simply changes the location to somewhere I am not. I literally had to add a location in Google maps and name it as if it were my own business in order to get them to come to that point on the map. Worse yet it’s profoundly frustrating that there is no in app support or chat, the only possible place I have ever gotten a single helpful response is on Twitter. Twitter is a social media application not a support platform and now it’s been tanked by Elon.

2022-12-20 11:46:45,"My large taco order to help a friend who was running low on food at his party was never delivered. I tipped up front to boost the odds my order arrives quickly and safely. Then, all of a sudden, the app alerts me that the food was delivered. Uhhh, no. I’m pacing the front yard in the sub-freezing weather to ensure a quick handoff. Not a car in sight. Using the app’s map,  I saw the driver, Ryan, about 2 blocks away. I frantically tried to call him via the app but after multiple attempts was never able to get thru. As soon as I heard ringing, the call would be disconnected. Over and over again, that was my experience. Then the order in the app converted to delivered and that’s that. I kept trying to call and searched for helpful menu options, which were limited, until I suppose even Uber fatigued and suddenly presented me with a refund option that wasn’t there before.   I requested a refund but only the food cost was refunded. The driver happily cruised away with a tip, and presumably 24 tacos. 

Needless to say, the party guests were shocked at how easy it was to be scammed by an Uber Eats driver with no repercussions. I’m done with Uber Eats until I hear they have scamming under control.

Frankly, even refunding the tip isn’t enough. The stress and hassle and embarrassment of chasing down the driver via the app only tor walk back inside empty handed isn’t worth it.",1,False,BigTangle,Scammer drivers one click away,ubereats,1058959277,
2022-11-27 18:57:13,"Received a promo for $30 off a grocery delivery. I was curious to compare using the grocer’s app. TLDR, Uber eats was more expensive than going through the grocers app even after the promo. All the prices were about 30+ cents more expensive on Uber eats. I created the same delivery order in the grocery’s app and the total after taxes and hidden “fees” (about $15 on Uber) came to $6 less compared to Uber eats and that included a 20% tip where the Uber eats total did not, so it would have been even more expensive. Note there was no promo used on the grocer’s app other than automatically applied coupons. 

The odd thing is I’m pretty sure the Grocer still goes through Uber eats for delivery. Perhaps it’s door dash.. Crazy how an order on Uber Eats with $30 in promo credits costed more for the same items BEFORE adding a tip. Additionally, this cost comparison would still hold true even if I got an Uber eats membership which would have saved an additional $7 unless I didn’t tip on Uber eats for a total savings of $1 (which is lost to the membership fee). I’ll go with the grocers app that also automatically applies various coupons and free pickup if desired. 

The promo appears to be misleading and could trick customers who might not be aware of alternatives, so 2/5 for the deceptive practice.",2,False,pickle rick is already take,Buyers beware,ubereats,1058959277,

The rep. assured me that the way it works is that I will be refunded the delivery fee once the delivery has been completed. I voiced my confusion with such a business model to which they just kept reassuring me I could place my order and I would be getting my money back. It has been a week since and I was never refunded so I contacted a rep over the phone this time to which they told me the initial rep was wrong and I won’t be getting my money back. I then asked to speak to a higher up as they now scammed me into placing an order that I told them I would not be ordering if I had to pay the delivery fee since it was almost as much as the order itself.

They usually are very busy on weekends. It’s from past few months that’s Uber eats are giving offers on orders. We ordered from this restaurant and the food comes out to be stale. Only the rice was okay as it was eatable. It was too salty. And the chicken was soggy it was smelling badly. Firstly I did not receive any response in 15 hrs. So I raised the request again. I have never wrote a review on AppStore. But this time it’s quite frustrating as the support manager says that they cannot give a refund this time as it will be not fair for everyone using the app. I didn’t understand. My simple concern was why should I pay for a food which is stale? Is it fair for a customer? I also attached a picture of food which I trashed. Isn’t it enough to prove that your customer is loyal? Also I have ordered online seven times from same restaurant.

Granted they do bump it down a bit. But the false advertisement that Uber eats has going on is beyondDisgraceful. My main reason for writing this review or I guess I should say as I write this review. I have been waiting 45 minutes for an order that the app said would take 15-30 minutes. And the food will not be here for at least another 45 minutes. Disgraceful to say the least. I understand that your estimates are not going to be perfect but there is a big difference between 15 to 30 minutes in an hour and a half to two hours.

But not having to leave my house to shop for groceries and then spend time and effort making meals has been surprisingly rewarding! Uber Eats has changed the way I feel about “being too lazy” to do it myself, because the convenience is a justified reward for worn out full time workers, the elderly and disabled people. 

Ordering is SO easy, from a growing number of participating top fast food, healthy and top-notch restaurants. It IS a little pricier but the minimal extra cost is WELL WORTH IT! Average time from submitting an order to delivery at your door is about 20-35 minutes, or 40-50 during holiday seasons. And everything is hot, fresh and ready to serve. 

I’ve been happy with this app’s service with only a couple rare exceptions: Twice my order was delivered to the wrong address, and a couple times they forgot to deliver the drinks on the order. However, with their excellent Customer Support, I was reimbursed for the entire order or the missing items.

This app is definitely worth checking out and is especially a life SAVER for working parents who just want time to unwind after a long day’s work without having to shop for groceries and cook. I highly recommend Uber Eats!

Any replies you get to requests for help are just boilerplate canned comments, which usually don’t have anything to do with the issue. They have devolved into the single worst company I can think of based on customer experience. They’re genuinely horrible.

Their drivers never check order accuracy, so it’s often wrong, has missing items, etc. Uber support tells me that “due to my refund and adjustment history” they can’t issue any type of refunds any more. “A significant number of refunds or adjustments” reflects poorly on Uber Eats and their quality of service, not on my account history or trustworthiness. I submit images when I have an issue — there’s literally photographic proof of what happened. My integrity is not in question, and to insinuate that I am being dishonest is deeply offensive.

Perhaps Uber should be more concerned with improving their order accuracy, drivers, and truly terrible customer service. It would be a better use of their time, rather than blaming customers for their issues.

Whatever the competition is, they can’t be worse than Uber.

I’ve confirmed (multiple times) with both restaurants and delivery people that Uber Eats, as mentioned in others’ reviews, “dispatches” delivery people (they actually choose whether or not to show up and often don’t) to the restaurant at their whim and with no relation to when diners’ food is actually ready.

Curious, then, that the app will say, the restaurant is “wrapping up your order,” when nothing could be further from the truth.

Last night was the final straw, as I placed my initial order circa 8:30p. Uber Eats then sent a delivery person to the restaurant who opted to stay there for approximately 10 seconds (before the kitchen could get to food out to him, he’d left) and canceled the order. No text notification or call; just an email that showed up 15 minutes later.

I was able to resubmit the order so fortunately my food wasn’t tossed, but 90 minutes later - after having spoken directly *with* the kitchen, who confirmed my food had been ready since shortly after 8:30 and had been *closed* for the past 45 minutes - guess what Uber Eats was claiming as to the status of my food?

When I complained about the delayed order the customer service would not even acknowledge that the order is late. After repeating multiple times they offered me $5 for compensation. How is that ok?

You should also make sure you're alright with giving your driver either a thumbs up or thumbs down. There is no way to rate specific aspects of the meal, star amounts, or even provide a description. Drivers who have an interest in improving their delivery quality have no clue how to do so without feedback. 

Theres also increased charges, more than the usual rate of the restaurant if you were to order directly. A $14 meal cost nearly twice as much after all the fees. You need to stay vigilant because if youre not careful, they will take money out from under you.

Lastly, if you have an issue with an order, just consider it a loss. Customer service will only feed you pre-written lines, sometimes giving you 'help' that doesn't even apply to your issue. And thats if they even choose to respond.
