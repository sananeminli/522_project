2540,504,ubereats,1058959277,2022-11-26 23:18:08,Totally disappointed,"Then #1 how is it possible that Uber may allow a customer to cancel and order over phone that he placed online through the app instead of canceling using the app, and #2 how is that you can tell me I won't receive full refund for a non-demonstrated action.",2

2546,505,ubereats,1058959277,2022-12-12 15:55:05,Refund,Upon my cancellation the app told me it would be a standard 4-7 business days for my refund to be processed so I was alright waiting but it was already 5 days and I had not received my refund so I decided to follow up and see what the hold up was just for Uber to transfer me over and over and end up not resolving my issue just to receive an email that I was not eligible for a refund.,1
2547,505,ubereats,1058959277,2022-12-12 15:55:05,Refund,I tried to call and a customer service agent from Uber notifies me that because it was past 48hrs of me contacting uber about my refund that they would not issue it back to me because they have ‘procedure's' in place to be followed.,1
2548,505,ubereats,1058959277,2022-12-12 15:55:05,Refund,I am not going to get my refund because I followed the process that the app told me to but apparently I was supposed to call Uber to cancel the order for me.,1

2550,505,ubereats,1058959277,2022-12-12 15:55:05,Refund,Why are there not steps on the app then to be user friendly and also give out information about cancellation and what not.,1
2551,505,ubereats,1058959277,2022-12-12 15:55:05,Refund,This app has left a bad taste in my mouth and please be careful anyone using the app.,1

2564,506,ubereats,1058959277,2022-11-13 21:23:39,Wow wow wow wow,"It would have been better if they just said, ""we're sorry we messed up"", vs. the ridiculous explanation I was given.",1

2575,508,ubereats,1058959277,2022-11-19 23:15:04,So many bugs,I wrote this review a year and a half ago.,1
2576,508,ubereats,1058959277,2022-11-19 23:15:04,So many bugs,I STILL cannot understand for the life of me why this broken app gets anywhere near 5 stars.,1

4394,719,ubereats,1058959277,2022-11-30 19:28:34,Worst experience of my life,so I issued a refund to my Uber Eats account so I could re-order my order and no I don't get the first order discount so I can't use the money and have to spend more money if I want the same order and I'm still waiting on the first order because he said he would bring it but he never dead.,1

4424,724,ubereats,1058959277,2022-10-11 01:08:25,Worst app,I wrote to those people and told Uber to check my history on other places to see if I've ever reported something missing from my order and the answer to that is NO.,1

7085,1156,doordash,719972451,2022-10-23 02:39:44,Dashers don't follow instructions,The protocol is the dasher contacts you.,1
7086,1156,doordash,719972451,2022-10-23 02:39:44,Dashers don't follow instructions,Then they ask if you want a credit or a refund.,1
7087,1156,doordash,719972451,2022-10-23 02:39:44,Dashers don't follow instructions,I would have chosen credit bc I needed the cat food tonight and would have reordered.,1

7113,1158,doordash,719972451,2022-12-17 00:03:14,Service,Which is totally the reason why I don't use this or any service often anymore.,3
7114,1158,doordash,719972451,2022-12-17 00:03:14,Service,So why pay for dash pass?,3

7237,1170,doordash,719972451,2022-10-08 19:52:28,Dasher issues,Unfortunately I was unable to continue using doordash because apparently when you have a dasher driver account AND  a personal doordash ordering app under the same email issues can arise.,1
7238,1170,doordash,719972451,2022-10-08 19:52:28,Dasher issues,I decided to take the doordash ordering app off my phone because now I want to cook more.,1
7239,1170,doordash,719972451,2022-10-08 19:52:28,Dasher issues,Due to me deactivating my personal doordash ordering app it ended up kicking me out of my dasher driver account.,1

7241,1170,doordash,719972451,2022-10-08 19:52:28,Dasher issues,Where it went wrong was when I was ASSURED that both accounts could be separated and that it would take 24/48 hrs.,1

7244,1170,doordash,719972451,2022-10-08 19:52:28,Dasher issues,On top of the the support person I spoke also let m know that my request to separate my accounts was never possible so why assure me that it was?,1

7250,1171,doordash,719972451,2022-12-12 01:13:44,Amazing Customer Service,"But the difference is that every time I've asked for customer service help from doordash, I'm always connected to a real person who is actually perfectly reasonable and extremely helpful about what they can do to make things right for me.",5
7251,1171,doordash,719972451,2022-12-12 01:13:44,Amazing Customer Service,"Also, the ""help"" button is very easy to find.",5

7266,1173,doordash,719972451,2022-12-20 03:20:30,Just wanted my Cheetos,Then he finds that there is only a bigger more expensive version that I then have to pay more for.,1
7267,1173,doordash,719972451,2022-12-20 03:20:30,Just wanted my Cheetos,THEN they mess up the LAST bag of chips getting the wrong kind therefor rendering them useless as nobody in my house even likes that kind.,1

7273,1174,doordash,719972451,2022-11-07 23:28:11,DoorDash order,I told him I simply can't because I'm working.,1

7275,1174,doordash,719972451,2022-11-07 23:28:11,DoorDash order,So instead he told me I'm wasting HIS time and just left it at a door on SOME MUD.,1
7276,1174,doordash,719972451,2022-11-07 23:28:11,DoorDash order,When I finally had time to go the door he left it at I had to take the food out the bag but when I opened the bag my soup was spilled all over my food so I couldn't even eat it anymore.,1
7277,1174,doordash,719972451,2022-11-07 23:28:11,DoorDash order,Im glad I was able to get a some what refund but that would never make up the experience I just had I smell like the soup and covered in it and now I have to wait to get home to eat because I don't ever want to order food on these apps again.,1
7278,1174,doordash,719972451,2022-11-07 23:28:11,DoorDash order,Would be careful because when things happen like this all they can do is apologize.,1

7308,1178,doordash,719972451,2022-10-29 19:48:07,Yikes,"These little mistakes happen all the time when you go to a restaurant..However, apparently after a few orders with missing items, they stop refunding for the missing items—and support chat will just keep disconnecting you before you can figure out what's going on.",1

7310,1178,doordash,719972451,2022-10-29 19:48:07,Yikes,But SUPPORT trying to shrug me off so that they don't have to tell me I'm not getting a refund for food I paid for but didn't receive was infuriating.,1
7311,1178,doordash,719972451,2022-10-29 19:48:07,Yikes,I think I went through 8 different representatives before we got to our conclusion.,1

7316,1178,doordash,719972451,2022-10-29 19:48:07,Yikes,But bad policies like this are enough for me to just go drive around the block to get my own food.,1
7317,1179,doordash,719972451,2022-10-25 01:25:00,Shady and unethical,Used DoorDash and paid for their dash pass for close to 2 years used serval times a week.,1

7322,1179,doordash,719972451,2022-10-25 01:25:00,Shady and unethical,After becoming frustrated in told them if they would like to keep my business they could call me which never happened.,1

7585,1209,doordash,719972451,2022-12-06 20:30:28,Downfall,Maybe DoorDash should pay their drivers more and have less restrictions on who can dash because I tried to dash myself for over two years and they never accept me.,1

7970,1251,doordash,719972451,2022-10-09 22:22:31,Insubordinate employees,So if you ever get Andrew as your door dasher make sure to cancel that order and order from someone else.,1

7973,1252,doordash,719972451,2022-12-06 01:51:44,Awesome app poorly executed,I have an issue were I order something even with paying for premium fast delivery were drivers will add to there route and deliver to people who ordered after first and wait at other restaurants by the time I get my food it's 30 to 40 minutes past delivery time and my food is ice cold because the drivers are not using hot bags and it's way over the delivery time and I've had 3 instances of drivers dropping food off around the block from my house I've lucked out and managed to get it before someone else has but there needs to be consistency across the board cause if you think about say you order a gyro like I did today it has lettuce in it by the time I get it it's super soggy and already gone cold even though i pay for fast delivery and dashpass,2

8294,1293,doordash,719972451,2022-11-06 18:40:27,Best review( real n***a answer),If you want real advice take it right here it's waaaay better if you go by yourself grab your food and take it home then using this app but if you can't go grab the food yourself use this I only rated it one star because of the tax that's thrown on here for no reason I can't even tip the DoorDash driver bc 10 dollars gets added on every meal you order to sum up the story / if you absolutely can't get the food yourself use this app but if you can then absolutely do NOT use this app you'll waste waay more money on tax than gas using this.,1
8295,1293,doordash,719972451,2022-11-06 18:40:27,Best review( real n***a answer),This app can also just help you find other places to eat and what the menus and prices will be I keep it on my phone just in case I'm ever in a situation where I have into use it but I barley ever use this app because of the money tax,1
8296,1294,doordash,719972451,2022-09-22 18:48:21,Spectacularly Bad,"Between the up charges, the dashers who will drop your food off at the wrong house or at the driveway and not the front door and the customer service that goes through an entire script before you can get a refund for a delivery never showing up, I can't recommend this for anyone.",1
8297,1294,doordash,719972451,2022-09-22 18:48:21,Spectacularly Bad,Plus we need to get back to a lifestyle of picking up our own food rather than paying 40% more after charges and tips to have it brought to us.,1
8298,1294,doordash,719972451,2022-09-22 18:48:21,Spectacularly Bad,"On the flip side, having driven for DoorDash and Postmates in 2020 when my job was on hiatus, I can heartily encourage you to support Postmates if you must order delivery.",1
8299,1294,doordash,719972451,2022-09-22 18:48:21,Spectacularly Bad,Their drivers are treated much better and have better earning potential… and it shows cause I've never had a problem with a Postmates driver dropping food off at the door.,1
8300,1295,doordash,719972451,2022-09-19 00:51:51,What a joke,After waiting two hours for my order I called support to get assistance and told them that my order had first and canceled for no reason and that when I called the restaurant to come pick it up myself they informed me that they had assigned a new driver to my new order.,1
8301,1295,doordash,719972451,2022-09-19 00:51:51,What a joke,my driver was not the issue it was the app canceling the order without a reason and when I informed customer service of this they informed me that they can offer me a five dollar credit for my $43 order that is now pending on my account two different times because I had to redo the order.,1
8302,1295,doordash,719972451,2022-09-19 00:51:51,What a joke,"so two hour wait for an order that was supposed to arrive within 30 minutes and almost $90 taken out of my account until the first refund goes through, and they offer me five dollars…",1

8308,1296,doordash,719972451,2022-12-19 05:51:10,New Changes,"Unless I add the extra fee to have it come straight to me, I have to wait for low quality food that I could've gotten myself in a shorter time.",2

8310,1297,doordash,719972451,2022-12-15 17:36:21,Better packaging for orders NEEDED,Companies that partner with door dash should do better about providing quality and acceptable packaging for delivery orders to ensure the customer's food isn't tampered with.,2
8311,1297,doordash,719972451,2022-12-15 17:36:21,Better packaging for orders NEEDED,Door dash should include this in their policies if company's wish to partner with doordash to extend their services through delivery.,2
8312,1297,doordash,719972451,2022-12-15 17:36:21,Better packaging for orders NEEDED,Some places use brown packaging bags that are sealed with a sticker and stapled to ensure the food is not tampered with yet some places only place the food within a plastic bag with no stability and double tie the bag as if the dasher cannot untie the knot and tamper with the contents.,2
8313,1297,doordash,719972451,2022-12-15 17:36:21,Better packaging for orders NEEDED,This should be heavily considered by the higher ups at door dash more so from a public health and safety standpoint to ensure more quality services is being provided for users of their services.,2
