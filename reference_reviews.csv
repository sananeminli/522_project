203,"They force you to work on a schedule otherwise they won't give you a lot of orders and will give you $4 orders going 10+ miles away as a punishment and if you reject the order it affects your acceptance rate which they will eventually deactivate you for, they treat their drivers like employees yet they label us as independent contractors."
203,This company should not be in business for breaking labor laws continuously and people shouldn't drive for them because they will take advantage of you.
1121,I have been both a consumer and dasher and it's very convenient for a consumer if you are willing to pay the extra fee but it's also hard to tip so much extra for the dasher to make it worth while.
1121,As a previous dasher I know that it is hard to even call it a side hustle.
1121,"Most consumers are reluctant to leave a tip and when they do it's minimal, but I understand as a consumer that it's hard to pay a big tip when you order something and the price is twice as much as item you paid for just because door dash charges extra."
1121,Then you have you tile the driver because trust be they don't make much without a tip.
1121,Please tip big for these dashers if they do a good job so there is more value in it.
1121,"Remember, door dah doesn't pay for gas, insurance, maintenance or anything."
1121,Yes dashers get a tax write off but it's not exactly the same.
1121,"..Also, if you are a dasher you may want to try instacart instead if it is popular in your city."
1121,Especially in the winter.
1121,It's pays better and it keeps you more active throughout the day.
1121,I made way more doing instacart when I was trying both.
1121,Around $20 and hour.
1121,Again you are an independent contractor so you can get write offs.
1121,"I personally wrote off all of my taxes as a instacarter and make about 40,000 a year gross income."
1228,"First off, $42 for 2 sandwiches."
1228,"Not fancy sandwiches, we're talking run of the mill sandwich shop on the corner sandwiches."
1228,That's not counting a tip or the delivery fee.
1228,The sandwiches at the store don't even cost half this amount.
1228,"In fact, for this amount I could get 2 more sandwiches or at least 4 sides."
1228,"This is literally price gouging and should be removed from the Apple Store...Keep in mind that your delivery person through DoorDash is an ""independent contractor""."
1228,"What this means is limited background information, questionable ethics, minimal control over individual delivery persons on DoorDash's end, and of course DoorDash enjoys limited liability because their delivery contractors are not employees of DoorDash."
1228,Sketchy practices at best.
1228,"Fake reviews on the App Store should be a big red flag, but big tech allows it."
1228,Really wish COVID hadn't given them such a boom in business.
1228,Companies with shady practices like this deserve to drown.
14,I've never used meal delivery services that require a membership to be more affordable.
14,"But not having to leave my house to shop for groceries and then spend time and effort making meals has been surprisingly rewarding!..Grubhub has changed the way I feel about ""being too lazy"" to do it myself, because the convenience is a justified reward for worn out full time parents, the elderly and disabled people."
14,"..Ordering is SO easy, from a growing number of participating top fast food, healthy and top-notch restaurants."
14,It IS a little pricier but the minimal extra cost is WELL WORTH IT!
14,"Average time from submitting an order to delivery at your door is about 20-35 minutes, or 40-50 during holiday seasons."
14,"And everything is hot, fresh and ready to serve."
14,"..I've been happy with this app's service, overall   However I do have occasional issues, especially within the last 3 months or so:  .1."
14,"Orders that display a status of ""being prepared"" or ""on the way"" but are suddenly cancelled without explanation or notification."
14,.2.
14,"Orders that indicate delivery completed, but never received."
14,These are always cases where they delivered to the wrong address.
14,.3.
14,"And lastly, orders that are missing items, especially the drinks."
14,"..I still recommend this app and I still use it often but I want people to be aware that the service is not without occasional delays, problems or issues."

29,"I pick up my own orders when I can, but when I am starving and don't feel like going; Grubhub is awesome!"
29,The restaurant's I order from are delicious and the drivers are excellent.
29,I get my orders in a timely manner and the food is hot and the drinks are cold - winter and summer!
29,So treat yourself!
29,I first used Grubhub last holiday season!
29,No traffic headaches and timely service!
29,Holiday testing is a good measure for service.
29,These folks have never let me down!
29,Steak Out has actually hung up on me when I called during the week.
29,Not just once or twice - consistently.
29,The weekend crew is great.
29,"However, Grubhub has never disappointed me no matter what day it is!"
29,Steak Out just loses my business on hang up days!
29,And Grubhub comes through!!
29,!
527,"UberEATS doesn't protect its users… I ordered delivery over the weekend, when my food arrived, I noticed the restaurant overcharged me for an item (I paid for 50 frozen cheese breads in preparation for the holiday season and only received 12)."
527,I reported the issue to them immediately and they told me they don't issue refunds and that I should reach out to the restaurant directly.
527,"I reached out to the restaurant, they admitted the mistake, and said they would offer the refund via UberEATS."
527,"A few days later, I haven't seen the refund credit come through and contacted UberEATS to a response stating that I reported the issue too late and they don't issue refunds."
527,Also something about I have large amounts of refunds on my account—last order mistake I reported was 3 years ago for under $20.
527,"It is such an arbitrary excuse on their part...Basically, the restaurant admitted the mistake, I reported the issue immediately after receiving the order, asked UberEATS to issue the refund, and they refused."
527,I just deleted this app.
527,This is terrible customer service and now I am owed money I cannot get back…it's extremely frustrating!
535,I've never used meal delivery services that I require a membership to be more affordable.
535,But not having to leave my house to shop for groceries and then spend time and effort making meals has been surprisingly rewarding!
535,"Uber Eats has changed the way I feel about ""being too lazy"" to do it myself, because the convenience is a justified reward for worn out full time workers, the elderly and disabled people."
535,"..Ordering is SO easy, from a growing number of participating top fast food, healthy and top-notch restaurants."

535,"And everything is hot, fresh and ready to serve."
535,"..I've been happy with this app's service with only a couple rare exceptions: Twice my order was delivered to the wrong address, and a couple times they forgot to deliver the drinks on the order."
535,"However, with their excellent Customer Support, I was reimbursed for the entire order or the missing items...This app is definitely worth checking out and is especially a life SAVER for working parents who just want time to unwind after a long day's work without having to shop for groceries and cook."
535,I highly recommend Uber Eats!.Renée W.
960,"I have had not one, not two, but three drivers in the course of the last few weeks pick up my food - drive it all the way to me and disappear and all I get back is Uber cash - not a refund to my card."
960,And the two deliveries I used that didn't show was used from the Uber cash.
960,Just pointless.
960,I have a ring doorbell camera and a detailed description in my notes of my house.
960,No one ever showed.
960,I had to contact my bank for fraud to get an actual refund and submitted a new card.
85,"Recently, I placed an order for my elderly mother."
85,"The driver dropped the food at the house next door, the proceeded to curse me out when I asked where she left the food."
85,Apparently she was too stupid to notice no one lived at the house next door.
85,This wouldn't have been a problem except that I live in another state and my mother was unable to walk to the neighbor's house on her own.
85,Grubhub needs to better assess the basic intelligence of their drivers in the suburbs.
85,I've never had a problem in the city.
85,But the suburban drivers are viscous.
85,Had to have the order refunded b/c Grubhub could not guarantee the same moron wouldn't be the driver of the order was redelivered.
183,"Thank you to a great concept, it helps my sister and I get good hot food to our elderly Mother and her mentally challenged sister."
183,We both live too far away to get healthy food to them on a regular basis.
183,Being able to get them something different and tasty is very important.
190,The app works fine.
190,"The company, honestly, NEEDS to go out of business and replaced with something that isn't a joke."
190,Nearly 80-90% of my ordered have some form of error or issue.
190,"..Tonight, our first order was canceled after waiting over and hour."
190,"..The second order arrived, now 2.5 hours after we initially ordered our first order (when we started getting hungry), and an ENTIRE entree is missing."
190,"My elderly mother did not get the food she wanted, and because we all purchased spicy items or other items she can't have, she had to eat crackers and tuna."
190,..This is just ridiculous.
190,"..You wouldn't have to steal so much of the restaurants money, if you didn't have to cover the costs of so many errors!"
39,GrubHub has canceled 3 of my last 5 orders.
39,"Today, I ordered from shake shack and got a text from shake shack that my order was ready."
39,I looked in the GrubHub app and it didn't have a driver assigned to my order.
39,"I reached out to customer service and the agent, Ralph, after I said that I got the text from shake shack still told me that my order was in the works and they hadn't assigned a driver as a result."
39,I said it wasn't still in the works because I received the text from shake shack that it was ready.
39,As a response he just ignored what I said and repeated that the order was in the works and would arrive in about 40 minutes.
39,(Meaning it would be ice cold).
39,THEN they canceled my order meaning my order is sitting in shake shack being wasted and I don't have time for lunch.
39,Ever since GrubHub bought Seamless the service has been atrocious.
39,I miss old seamless.
714,Uber Eats is a great service.
714,But the last time I ordered from Panda Express was less then pleasant.
714,Is it just me or are the portions getting smaller and smaller.
714,They modify their boxes so they don't give you as much food?
714,It's disturbing.
714,Charge whatever you need to but I want what I want!
714,I ordered from Panda Express today again and this will be my last if the quality and quantity isn't there.
714,I want my fried rice to be full!
714,And my Beijing Beef!
714,"If not, there will not be anymore ordering from this restaurant."
785,Ordered a Panda Express meal which included around a $15 entree.
785,It was not delivered despite charging me.
785,No phone number to call except delivery person.
785,Who upon being notified of error notified Uber Eats.
785,The app said to go through app fir resolution.
785,No response except by email to go through app and also through email.
785,Neither produced any results except saying they are not able to refund.
785,.Worst customer service experience ever.
785,Truly frustrated    After a week of hoping for a resolution without any type of offer to make me whole I have deleted this app and will never use them again
603,I've used this app to make probably over a hundred orders over the years..One of the reasons I was so happy to recommend it was my experiences with support.
603,"Sometimes, things go wrong, and Uber usually makes it right for a customer like me."
603,My views on the company changed today.
603,".I just had to watch my neighbor wait over 2 hours past her estimated delivery for her driver (who had their phone off) to finally mark it ""delivered""."
603,"15 til midnight and she is having a borderline blood sugar crisis, and I'm having to drive to Taco Bell because the original restaurant (BJs) is closed..Support chat was entirely automated, or at least not literate."
603,They did not answer her concerns.
603,No phone support for customers.
603,".Literally, call me."
603,Don't expect more orders or subscriptions from me if you aren't willing to let me talk to a human about what I just saw.
603,Selling my stock Monday jfc
768,I can't find a single way to change the type of notifications I get from the app.
768,"I can't turn off notifications in my phones settings because I need notifications when I actually order food, but I receive 5 notifications a day minimum for different promotions."
768,I don't need that and there should be a way to disable promotional notifications.
768,..I won't even get into how expensive the service is either.
768,A $10 order from Taco Bell costed me $23 in the end and that's with Uber One which is suppose to be less or no delivery fees?
863,You should do better with your restaurants!
863,I still have not received my refund from Friday night!
863,I did not receive half my order had to order again cz nothings open that late besides Taco Bell!
863,First order that wasn't all there took over an hour and the 2nd order took 45 min!
863,I deserve a full refund!
863,Food was cold also!
863,Ridiculous and never again!!
863,This has happened a few times through Uber Eats so I do believe I will use someone different!!
863,I pay for that food plus a tip!
863,!
1027,I ordered taco bell and got 4 things of nacho cheese and even ordered extra cheese.
1027,I got no nachos and just cheese and all the cheese was empty.
1027,I have contacted the company and is waiting for them to contact me back but overall this is the first time it's happen.
1027,Also it said I was getting my order picked up by one guy and then switched to another guy and the guy that delivered the food is a different person.
1027,It says to rate the guys delivery but it's not the same guy.
1027,Do I think he ate it?
1027,maybe .
1027,The bag wasn't open or ripped and it was tape down with the stickers so I don't think so but It was just weird.
1205,"They always do everything right last time, always getting my order right, I just don't mind the missing items at all, but this time I'm quitting this app and uninstall it, one of the dasher's name is Vincent stolen my big meal order from Taco Bell, trying to trick into thinking it is here at my front of my doorstep but it's not, and never there so I cancel my subscription and everything else and never will come back here again, they needed a better dasher and higher security to prevent thefts from stealing our food that we ordered, such a ashame, never wanna use this again, I can see why the DoorDasher didn't even take a photo screenshot for proof that it is laying right in front of my doorstep….so it is definitely stolen, I looked everywhere for my meal even in the neighbor's next door house on the front of there doorstep… never again!!"
1205,"Almost $100 down the drain, customer service is still horrible… I wanted my refund now!"
1205,!
1216,YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED!
1216,"!IF YOU HAVE CARE ABOUT YOUR MONEY OR HAVE FINANCIAL PROBLEMS, DONT BOTHER ORDERING HERE!!!"
1216,ITS THEFT!!
1216,GO TO UBEREATS!
1216,ITS SLIGHTLY MORE ON PRICE BUT THEY ARE PRECISE!!
1216,"!if i could give a 0 i would, my last 3 experience hurt financially because they basically stole my money and food."
1216,i made an order with taco bell yesterday 6 am and waited an hour for the store to say they couldnt find my order-.- THEN later that day i made an order and my dasher with towards henderson instead of north las vegas and when he got to me half my food was missing and it was all cold.
1216,"then just now i made a Dennys order and it was accidentally for pick up which i chose delivery okay, and i contact support for them to say they can cancel it and i can reorder it, so she did and connected me to another agent who couldnt refund me…."
1216,"so my order was canceled so i didnt have a choice but to donate $50 which 2/3 of it was not mine, now i owe money and food to 2 people thanks to doordash, plus i lost atleast $50 from yesterdays order."
1260,"I use DD all of the time, and I'm even a dasher myself."
1260,"Though, I feel like there could be some ways the communication between the dasher and their customer(s) can be better...• a way to see how busy an area is when ordering to get a rough gauge of how long the delivery may take..• a pop up of sorts, that would encourage a customer to tip more if an area or specific restaurant has long wait times, like for Taco Bell at night time."
1260,.• the ability to let us choose a cash tip option.
1260,"Sometimes it's much easier to tip cash, but since it's a dying currency, I can understand why it's not an option."
1283,"Probably done 100 orders on door dash, Been getting meals 30 min delays."
1283,Not the drivers fault.
1283,The calculations are way off.
1283,It's getting annoying...Started ordering from this Taco Bell that constantly messed up my orders.
1283,"First 3 times DD refunded my money instantly, it was away s 2 small items."
1283,Then one day they said no more refunds.
1283,Got on with help center.
1283,They refused to help.
1283,Kept sending robot responses.
1283,"I said cool you are just doing your job, please send confirmation you have sent this issue further up the chain, I even have video proof of me opening the food bags."
1283,No confirmation email.
1283,No reply to me requesting that I wanted a confirmation email.
1283,"They would close the chat, i would re open it and they kept shutting down the chat."
1283,"I would expect this of a scam caller, but not a big corporation."
1283,Very garbage.
1311,I've driven for DoorDash and they barely break even .
1311,"They're overcharging double ""local"" fees."
1311,Just straight up money that can last you decades all of it goes to you guys.
1311,3 Taco Bell items for $31 ?
1311,Dang I know inflation is bad but you can do better .
1311,Be grateful you were successful with this app but just remember how it started before more people realize and your income declines.
1311,"This will make a great rant for 3.2 mil people 😂😂🤣😊 stop being greedy and lower the ""local"" fees or at least just charge me once not 2x local fees .. the restaurant is up the street for $31."
1311,This is in PDX.
1311,You guys already billion dollar company 😂😂 just scamming the poor.
1311,This company does not care about anything besides their money.
1311,Great PR 🙃.Some will steal your info as well and charge your whole paycheck.
605,DOORDASH and POSTMATES >> uber eats ..Do yourself a favor and do NOT use Uber eats.
605,"My father died recently and I simply needed food delivered, as I was too depressed to go out."
605,"..I paid extra for ""priority delivery"" so my food would arrive at ‘6:20pm latest' according to the app."
605,At 6:50pm I start getting upset as my order was now over 30+ minutes late.
605,"..Why did I pay extra money for ""priority delivery"" to have my food delivered much later than the advertised time?"
605,"I then tried getting connected to support to be refunded the ""priority delivery"" cost, since that was false advertising."
605,I asked to speak to the manager and was disconnected from TWO extremely unhelpful customer service reps.
605,"The second one was named pranveet, I believe."
605,Both reps said they would send me an email so I could file my claim.
605,..Neither of them ever sent me an email.
605,Staff was lazy; they lacked basic compassion and effort.
605,Because of .A) False Advertising and .B) Unhelpful and Lazy Staff .I immediately deleted my Uber Eats app.
605,I will NEVER use it again and would NEVER willingly give my business to such a dishonest company.
605,..DoorDash and Postmates treat customers with a much higher level of respect and integrity.
605,I highly suggest going that route instead of being scammed by UberEats.
605,Your choice.
978,I do not have money to waste when there are days I literally starve so I'm not going to continue to waste my time trying to save money when you end up spending more .
978,These support people do not care and just frustrate you even more .
978,I receive a message that says don't wait to claim your $20 off and a meal on us but it seems like it's just a way to get you to pay something else .
978,This is false advertising and deceiving people and shows no respect or concern for any customers .
212,Not feeling well so have gotten grub hub this weekend for the family.
212,I've ordered it 4 times in two days.
212,Three out of four times the order was wrong.
212,The last time it took 2x the length of time it was suppose to and when it got here the ice cream was almost completely melted.
212,Did I mention it was not even the correct order?
212,You pay extra for convenience but all you get is cold food you didn't even want.
555,Experienced total dissatisfaction with the whole app and services.
555,I did not appreciate the way in which their customer service rep implied dishonest behavior on my part.
555,There had been a 3 separate incidents back to back in which errors were made to my orders.
555,As expected I'd reported those issues and the first 2 times they'd issues a refund.
555,And although the refund is great it still did not make up for a total waste of time and a complete let down when the food I expected to received was not delivered as expected.
555,"However on the last reported issue, not only was I denied a refund but my issue was not taken seriously."
555,I had picture evidence of the fact that I received 2 orders that were wrong.
555,"In addition, one pint of ice cream was missing it's safety seal."
555,"The customer reps just kept saying that my ""refund activity"" did not allow for a refund."
555,In addition they just said to rate the merchant directly so that those issues could be avoid in the future.
555,I'd highly advice not to use this app!
790,"I ordered a pint of ice cream, and seconds later tried to cancel and change my order."
790,The app let me cancel and afterwards mentioned I would not receive a refund.
790,So I end up paying $20 to get nothing in return basically stealing my money.
790,Customer service said there's nothing they can do and refused to help me with either a refund or credit.
790,Customer service also said I cannot pick up the item I ordered even though I paid for it.
790,..Please change your corrupt policies and maybe I'll use this again but for now I'm using DoorDash and Lyft since they care about their customers.
937,"I just had some ice cream delivered to my clients house for getting under contract in the sale of their home..They were given a brown paper bag with the ice cream in it, and ‘Angel B' written On the bag, and THEN they were given a flyer for the driver's animal aromatherapy business...Excuse me!?!"
937,I did not order anything remotely close to aromatherapy for animals!.
937,So to say my clients were a bit confused is an understatement.
937,"They said they were like, ‘Is the ice cream therapy for our dog?"
937,We were so confused!
937,"'.🆘🤬🤬🤬.She can hustle her animal aromatherapy on her own time, thankyouverymuch!"
937,"!..No need to screw up a delivery even further… I am Angel P, not B."
937,"..And btw, this was the absolute first time I have EVER used Über Eats."
937,.What an introduction!!!
937,!.I would love to take my tip back from my order.
937,The only thing she got correct was the address and that was cuz it was on the ticket!..Unreal.
1123,I've used DoorDash quite frequently over the past two years.
1123,However lately it seems I'm having more more issues with my food not being delivered to the correct address or Dashers picking up other orders and my food getting here extremely late.
1123,That has even happened when I've ordered things such as ice cream.
1123,I think the worst part about it is that some of these Dashers do not respond to your calls or messages.
1123,I could easily direct them to my house which is not at all difficult to find.
1123,GPS takes anyone directly to my driveway which is only 15 feet long.
1123,for a long time my orders often came without the drinks.
1123,Therefore I stopped ordering drinks.
1123,But now there seems to be issues more and more.
1123,The worst part is often times I only get partial refunds when a delivery does not go well.
1123,Or when the delivery is delivered to an entirely different place I get offered to have it re-delivered.
1123,But then the new Dasher ended up still picking up somebody else's order before mine and then came to my neighborhood with blaring music that caused some of my neighbors to step outside.
1123,Very embarrassing.
1123,I was afraid to even complain about the loud music as this person obviously knows where I live.
1123,All these issues coupled with the high prices make this no longer worth the trouble.
1123,therefore I have deleted the app and will no longer be using.
48,"Subway does this because it has franchises as individual owners, and screws the bottom line, but Arbys could easily get a boost in business if they put QR codes on their coupons."
48,"..Sure, they lose out on a dollar or something for every one, but corporations can easily afford to do this."
48,"People don't have cars, and when the weather gets rough for people who bike from place to place, things can get out of hand."
48,"Plus, it gives the coupons people usually throw away a solid use, while also giving people a means to get their money's worth...If college students get a ton of these in their mail every week, then why not make them worth the gas, paper, and landfill waste?"
48,"Arbys can do better here, and it'd be great to see that happen."
792,I am a college student who was recently on fall break at home.
792,I decided to order 70 McNuggets from McDonald's to feed my family and found that a 10 piece McNugget was missing from my order.
792,I appealed for a refund and opted for the Uber cash (the apps currency) option.
792,"A week later as I'm  back at school trying to order food I find that they not only still charged my card for the full amount including the $5 tip I added for my delivery driver, but they also took another $5 tip from my Uber cash."
792,I am now highly frustrated and unsatisfied with this service.
996,"I used to enjoy this app as a college student, but the last food order I had came ice cold and Uber did not do anything to fix the problem."
996,The order I currently have was promised by 9:45 as an UberOne member but all of a sudden they changed it to 10:15 without keeping their promise of gifting $5 if it came after 9:45.
996,This has gotten annoying and I can't afford to spend this amount of money on poor quality service/planning.
20,We ordered lunch at 10:30 with an 11:15 expected delivery.
20,Around 11:35 we start wondering where our food is.
20,No correspondence from our driver.
20,I look on the app and it says our food has been delivered.
20,We check all door locations- no food.
20,Start chatting with customer service and they won't give the drivers number or any form of communication.
20,They say the driver is no longer responding and that they cannot reprocess our order.
20,"By this time it is noon and to reorder, there is a 50-60 minute wait."
20,We ordered $90 worth of food which they said they would refund within 3-5 days and offered a $10 coupon.
20,"So by 12:30, we have no food, we have an hour wait for anything else and we have a $10 reward to a company that clearly does not vet their drivers."
20,I'm sorry but $10 is not enough to make up for the severe inconvenience and lack of ability to make it right in a timely manner.
20,Will definitely be using different apps from here on out.
245,I love GrubHub they always come through when I'm hungry.
245,GrubHub has the best drivers GrubHub brings the best food and it does it in a timely manner there's just something about Grubhub that I can't live without absolutely love it.
245,I love the city of Portland and I love GrubHub service in it.
602,Irritating to see functionality removed from the Uber eats tab in the Uber app in order to shill this completely gratuitous extra app for what?
602,Advertising?
602,"""Metrics capture""?"
602,"..There's an existent business model built into this already, that every 17 year old with a second honda and a desire to earn money has figured out for the last 50 years."
602,"Explicitly stated, your customer base is interested in exchanging money for food, delivered in a timely manner."
602,There's really no need to introduce customer-adverse complications.
602,"I'm available for consulting if you need a picture drawn...And stop adding single percentages to a tip already based on your garbage fees, rather than the food totals."
602,You think no one's going to notice that 21% is the new 20%?
602,How long do you think that will work?
602,Is this really better than remunerating your drivers?
602,Lame scam behavior.
602,Be better.
638,We ordered from this app and not only got the complete wrong order but received awful service along with it.
638,We ordered 30 wings and received one hamburger and zero wings.
638,When the driver called his service line they said they couldn't help us and to call the customer service line.
638,When we called them they said they could give us a refund for the wings but would give us no actual help with getting our food in a timely manner.
638,Uber Eats customer service refused to help in anyway except giving us a refund for the first time we ordered.
638,"So, we had to not only pay for our wings at wing house, so the money was charged twice until the refund eventually went through, but we had to drive to wing house ourselves to get the food so we could actually have our dinner."
828,Look.
828,"I get that in order to make more money, drivers do several pick ups at a time but this has gotten ridiculous."
828,"My orders are starting to come after the ""latest"" time given because the driver has multiple stops between the restaurant and my place."
828,It takes forever and my food is cold when I get it.
828,I don't wanna down rate the drivers but there should be a limit so people are getting their food in a timely manner.
838,"While I understand that all food delivery services have there share of problems, Ubereat's customer service leaves a lot to be desired."
838,I literally received raw food and have not heard anything from them.
838,This is the only food service platform that I have issues with the customer service taking so long to address an issue.
838,"I understand that certain things need to be reviewed, but places like DoorDash have been able to go over what happened with me in a timely manner."
838,Gonna use up the last of my gift card with them then uninstalling!
1077,I would urge you to use other food delivery apps.
1077,Postmates will charge you for undelivered orders simple because they could not provide the service they pride themselves on: delivery food.
1077,"You cannot receive a refund for a canceled order because they took too long to TRY and locate a driver..I will reiterate, USE A COMPETITOR to deliver you food in a safe and timely manner!.Location: major metropolitan city in the southwest."
1196,"DoorDash is awesome, especially for.parents who both work and sometimes just don't have the time or energy to make dinner."
1196,My biggest complaint is that lately Dashers have been picking up multiple peoples orders at a time.
1196,"When this happens, our food gets to us cold because the Dasher has driven around to other houses dropping off the other orders."
1196,"I understand the concept of efficiency, and that they are trying to make the most of their trips."
1196,"But it becomes problematic for the food temperature, and because the food ordered from DoorDash is more expensive than ordering pick-up from the restaurant app directly, it's expected that the orders will come correctly, in a timely manner, and warm."
1196,"Other than that, we've had pretty good experiences with DoorDash, which is why we did the 4 stars!"
1202,Okay this review is coming from a customer and a merchant point of view.
1202,"As a customer I have been screwed over by doordash countless times; cold food, missing items, cancelled order an hour after I placed it, etc."
1202,everyone is short staffed (I manage a restaurant) so if you do not have drivers why are you allowing customers to place orders??
1202,If a customer complains that the food is extremely cold or has a major piece missing why do you think $5 or less CREDIT is suffice??
1202,"As a merchant; if the first driver cancels after they have already picked it up, why not notify the restaurant so we can remake in a timely manner for the next driver, and the customer??"
1202,"Also check the attitude of some of your drivers, you send them to the restaurant 10-15 minutes BEFORE the order is scheduled to be picked up and we receive nothing but attitude at the restaurant."
1202,All and all this company needs to reassess how they do business.
1202,I should not be upset as a customer and merchant.
695,My Burger King order was 50 minutes late (11:15) from being picked up so I decided to cancel and order at another place.
695,I was not informed that cancelling the order would have made it so that I couldn't even order food at all because it stops at 10:30 in my area.
695,THIS NIGHT my Five Guys order took 90 MINUTES to get cancelled BY THE DRIVER!
695,"The driver had asked me an hour prior to the cancellation for my address because the app was bugging out (which it was), so I gave it to him."
695,No status updates for 40 minutes so I message him and 10 minutes later he cancels my order after reading my messages.
695,After TWO experiences like this I am highly unlikely to order from Uber Eats again.
739,"I ordered from Burger King, and over an hour later the delivery driver told me the ""app did it wrong"" and he had the wrong order but support wasn't answering him."
739,"He dropped it off anyway, it wasn't even from Burger King."
739,"I called customer service and they told me that they couldn't do anything until the driver marked it as ""delivered."""
739,"Once it was delivered, they said they couldn't redeliver because it was already marked as delivered."
739,They also said they couldn't give me a refund or credit because I'd complained about another order before.
739,"They took my money, provided no service, told me I was the problem and there was nothing they could do."
739,Nightmare service.
644,I don't use food delivery apps too often.
644,They are expensive.
644,Tonight I craved wings.
644,I order 16 bone-in wings and 22 boneless wings.
644,The restaurant told me they told the drive they were out of bone in wings.
644,Driver didn't mention it.
644,"I went to eat, opened one package and found 1/2 an order of boneless wings."
644,I opened the app.
644,I stayed it was half an order.
644,They credited me back 5$ worthless Uber eats dollars on a 66$ order.
644,I opened the second package and found the other half of the boneless wings.
644,I can't change this on the app in any way.
644,It says I've already been compensated.
644,The bone in wings that are not present are waaaaay more money.
644,There is no way to change it.
644,No way to get a refund.
644,No way in the app to even leave feedback.
644,You can keep your stupid 5 Uber eats Monopoly money.
644,Im never using Uber again.
517,I was a Uber one member until it wouldn't let me add a payment method and I just couldn't use the app.
517,When trying to resolve the issue they kept saying they were getting a tech error and I would be contacted back when I didn't.
517,"When finally asked for a screen shot of the issue, it accidentally finally worked with one payment method and accidentally signed me up for a year which I didn't want."
517,"I asked for a refund and to cancel my plan, when they tried to put it through again they said they were having a technical error and tech support was supposed to reach out."
517,TWO WEEKS later I am still trying to contact and get the issue resolved and I have had no help.
517,This app has become terrible.
517,Service is terrible from not only Uber customer service but the rides are super slow because it doesn't even seem they have enough drivers.
517,Terrible expirience all around.
517,Still waiting for my refund and now I'm going to have to go through my credit card it seems.
517,Still don't know how I'm going to get my account cancelled and really hope I don't get billed again so I have to deal with multiple cases!
579,I just had the worse experience with this app.
579,"I ordered priority delivery but after more than 40 minutes my order was still late, never arrived even past the projected latest arrival time."
579,The time never updated and my driver didn't even look like he was moving.
579,"The worst part is that even though all of this was going on, I couldn't cancel my order until I was finally connected to a customer service agent who was extremely rude."
579,"I have screen shots, refunded my money and disconnected the chat."
579,"I asked to complain and they rudely disconnected the chat, I have to believe that's by design as the company does not want to handle complaints."
579,"That's fine, I got my money back and will filing a complaint with BBB."
579,App was promptly deleted😆😆😆
735,IF YOUR TIP ISNT $10 OR MORE THE EMPLOYEES WONT PICK UP YOUR FOOD.
735,"I waited almost two hours for food to be delivered that they just canceled after an hour and 45 minutes someone finally picked it up, was going back and forth with Rohit D one of your employees and left the conversation at ok, I'll let you know if the food that's been sitting there ready for 45 minutes is any good it's bread so I'm gonna assume not."
735,I told them if the food was bad they would hear back from me but if it was fine thanks I appreciate it.
735,".Right after I send that message I get a notification my meal was finally picked up, two minutes later it was canceled."
735,.I have screen shots of the whole conversation with this worthless humans.
788,"2 Days ago I put in a order to Uber eats, my driver canceled my order and claimed they attempted to call and get in touch with me but never did !"
788,"I had a 42 dollar order , And Uber eats did nothing to help me get my money back , after emailing repeatedly they claimed I canceled my own order ."
788,"I then sent them screen shots of her cancellation of my order , they still continued to do nothing!"
788,So not only did I never receive my food but I also never got a refund for the food I never got!!!
788,UBER EATS it should not be this difficult for a customer to get a refund after a terrible experience like this !
788,!
788,I will no longer be using this app!
824,This is why I stopped using these third party apps.
824,I placed my order and was not able to edit it because of an app error.
824,Also would not let me edit it on my computer or tablet because of errors.
824,Reached out to customer service who told me to wait for delivery and then contact them again for a resolution.
824,So I did.
824,"In no way is this the drivers fault, but Uber customer service told me there was nothing they could do because the order was complete."
824,Want screen shots of the conversation?
824,I've got them if anyone wants to see.
889,App Never let me / prompted to add the menu item or discount for an extra item.
889,Was weird didn't get free menu item Or option to add one.
889,Happened two nights in a row.
889,Have screen shots can send.
889,Everything else is great but was weird it would not let me add menu item to mc Donald's order over $15 2x in a row
1037,I ordered my pizza.
1037,"Took screen shots of the order, with details of what is on pizza."
1037,"This Sierra girl sends a message to me asking what is on my pizza, when it's clearly in the description."
1037,I'm watching the click tick down.
1037,I'm watching her read the messages!
1037,Never responds back after asking me that one question.
1037,And I never here from her.
1037,"Hour later I call the number on her profile as it says my order is still in transit, a man answers and tells me my order was canceled."
1037,What?
1037,My husband told me not to use Postmates!
1037,Will never use again
131,So basically they drivers can steal your whole meal or even half the meal you try to get a refund they going to say they can't cuz your account is under some suspicious activity's idk why y'all think y'all company is so perfect it's not y'all have people that steal food or wont bring you your food and or food made completely wrong so basically if you order something it's a high chance I might not get it or my order wrong so take my money and give me whatever and interrogate me like I did something wrong yall services are very bad
328,Worst customer service when there's an issue.
328,Account gets flagged and frozen for normal use of having food delivered but they claim suspicious activity.
328,I'm sorry isn't that what GrubHub is?
328,Food delivery.
328,Customer service gives same robotic answer that's in some book somewhere.
328,They don't care about their customers.
846,"My phone got ""suspicious activity"" on it so I can't use it ever again for Uber when I don't feel like I did anything wrong."
846,I feel like there's no justice here and Uber is selfish like Microsoft and doesn't care about us the customers.
846,Tbh they want to false do thing to us and want us to stop using them and lose customers.
846,"If I could I prefer DoorDash since they ""ACTUALLY CARE"" about me but I can't since the price is to high for me ;( If Uber eats continues on this path of being selfish etc I know they will have no customers and go out of business… Uber fix yourselves ;/"
46,After several mishaps and simply just getting my money back each time after not receiving food or waiting hours for it I'm done!
46,The final straw was getting the wrong food from a different restaurant that contained food I'm allergic to and having Bryon tell me I'll get my money back within 3-5 business days.
46,Nothing for my time.
46,Restaurant was closed once everything was said and done and I ended up not having enough money to eat that night.
46,Canceled my subscription and will NEVER use this crappy app again!
46,I know two grub hub drivers and they tell me how crappy this service is to work for and will also not drive for them anymore.
46,"If you have one, please cancel your subscription and leave this app in the dust."
73,This is somehow the worst delivery and customer service.
73,"I've had food stolen, delivered to the wrong place, missing food items, customer services not providing solutions, and delivery drivers admitting they don't read delivery instructions."
73,The final straw was ordering food and then it being delivered almost an hour later where the food was cold and soggy.
73,"The solution, after I had spent almost $30, was a $5 credit to my account."
73,I assume people order hot food so they don't have to cook and here you are then having to heat up your food anyway.
73,After I use up the joke of a $5 credit (that will cover the delivery fee and MAYBE tax if lucky) I will no longer use this service.
73,It's a joke.
76,"I put in the delivery instructions for which entrance to where I work at, the drivers refused to follow the instructions."
76,"They dropped it off at tool rental or the pro desk, sometimes nasty to my co workers, before leaving...The final straw for this app I had was that I put my house as the address and the food was delivered to my work instead."
76,When I contacted the help desk all I was offered as compensation was 60 day free membership for the fact that I had to drive to pick up my food.
76,When I went into the app the next day there was no member ship and I couldn't even get in contact with their help.
76,Both Grubhub and doordash have messed up too many times to accept paying these exorbitant fees.
536,I used to use Uber and Uber Eats regularly.
536,I work more locally now and do not need to get rides often anymore.
536,"Without the rewards program, don't actually see any reason to choose Uber over a different service with cheaper pricing when I do need a ride."
536,"For Uber Eats, I've been a loyal customer and even paid for Uber One (and before that, Uber Pass)."
536,"Out of all of the orders I have placed, only a small percentage has led to me requesting help."
536,"Unfortunately, most of the requests have been recent because my food keeps arriving incomplete."
536,"A couple of nights ago, I was missing some food so I put in a help ticket, only to be told that I didn't qualify because of past requests."
536,"I wasn't expecting a full refund, just for the missing item!"
536,Why am I being punished because a merchant didn't care enough to check the order?
536,"Needless to say, I will be cancelling my Uber One subscription and switching to a different delivery service."
536,This was the final straw in a long line of issues that has led me to this point.
556,"An app and a company that actively lie to their customers, pay their delivery people as poorly as everyone else - all while lining their grubby little Silicon Valley pockets and delivering little to no value...I've confirmed (multiple times) with both restaurants and delivery people that Uber Eats, as mentioned in others' reviews, ""dispatches"" delivery people (they actually choose whether or not to show up and often don't) to the restaurant at their whim and with no relation to when diners' food is actually ready...Curious, then, that the app will say, the restaurant is ""wrapping up your order,"" when nothing could be further from the truth...Last night was the final straw, as I placed my initial order circa 8:30p."
556,"Uber Eats then sent a delivery person to the restaurant who opted to stay there for approximately 10 seconds (before the kitchen could get to food out to him, he'd left) and canceled the order."
556,"No text notification or call; just an email that showed up 15 minutes later...I was able to resubmit the order so fortunately my food wasn't tossed, but 90 minutes later - after having spoken directly *with* the kitchen, who confirmed my food had been ready since shortly after 8:30 and had been *closed* for the past 45 minutes - guess what Uber Eats was claiming as to the status of my food?..Yup."
556,"The closed-for-an-hour kitchen was ""wrapping up"" my order...Anything to say for yourselves, Uber Eats?"
805,"Every single time, you get a false order delivery estimate time that then inevitably ends up being extended multiple times."
805,"By the time you do get your order, the food is cold."
805,This last order was the final straw!
805,"We waited over an hour, and the order was assigned to three different drivers before we were told the merchant had cancelled the order because they were out of one item on the order!"
805,"One item - entire order cancelled, and we waited over an hour before anyone said anything!!!!!!"
805,..There are many more reliable services and processes from which to choose.
805,"Good riddance, Uber Eats!"
1016,They will steal your money amd food.
1016,Amd do NOTHING about it..I've used this many times before but tonight was the final straw.
1016,I was notified My food was delivered.
1016,Opened my door and saw it wasn't.
1016,I tried actually calling the driver first.
1016,No response.
1016,So I contacted cyst support and they literally told me they couldn't do anything about it or even refund me because the driver hit confirmed delivery.
1016,So I'm out $36 including his tip… and have no food..That's unacceptable.
1016,"So basically any driver who's hungry can say it's delivered, take your food, amd there's nothing you can do about it."
1016,Oh also he still gets paid.
1016,"The chat person even ended the chat with me and had the nerve to send me a ""did we resolve your issue"" message."
1016,No!
1016,You didn't!..Don't use this.
1016,Use Lyft.
1016,I've literally just canceled my Uber and postmates accounts because of this.
1218,I have used DoorDash for the past few years and everything about them has been continuously declining!
1218,"I have never had the issues with other food delivery companies that I've had with Door Dash, which includes, but is not limited to,  long delivery times, unfriendly ""Dashers"", missing food, cold food, CANCELLED orders after waiting on them AND WITHOUT ANY EXPLANATION (TWICE)!!"
1218,"But I have to say, the ""final straw"" for me is the huge price markups on food items!!!"
1218,"Like, seriously??"
1218,"The delivery fees and ""service fees"" aren't enough ya'll have to gouge us customers even more in this terrible economy right now??"
1218,"(And I DO tip well, always have)!!"
1218,"I am disabled and don't drive, so I sometimes use these food delivery services to deliver a meal to my home, especially my lil 11 yr old Grandson comes to stay with me, but I'm sorry DoorDash, we've reached the end of our journey together…..I must now delete you from my phone…..Sorry, not sorry!"
1218,Good luck to your future.
1223,There's always been some problems.
1223,In general I liked DoorDash because you could get food when you don't feel like cooking or going out.
1223,It becomes a problem when you wait an hour to receive food you can't or don't want to eat.
1223,The mix ups have been increasing to where more orders are wrong than those that are right.
1223,Order times are going from 30 minutes to 60-90 minutes because they're combining orders every time.
1223,The final straw is that the last two orders were someone else's order.
1223,"Wrong restaurant, wrong items."
1223,One time it was someone's $120 multiple item UberEats order that contained mostly seafood dishes that we did not want to eat.
1223,Last time was ordering breakfast food and getting someone else's burritos.
1223,It's a huge waste of food and it's hugely disappointing.
1223,"It's no longer worth the gamble of maybe we get something we want, maybe we don't."
1240,I order the same order at the same location consistently for pickup.
1240,Twice now DoorDash has updated the location to somewhere 20 minutes away!!
1240,The first time the manager was understanding and made my order at their location but I had to wait about 20 minutes.
1240,This time the manager was extremely rude and said drive to the other location.
1240,I called customer service to just get a refund and they put me on a 20 minute hold just to of canceled the order on their end and not even give me a refund!
1240,The customer service assistant even told me to just drive and go ask anyways.
1240,What kind of buggy app and sub par customer service is this?
1240,This was my final straw with all the terrible experiences I've had so far.
1240,No more door dash- deleting my account and app.
1240,Try Uber eats or something more reliable instead.
621,It's so funny how my review got deleted.
621,Uber eats wasn't accepting none of my payment methods so I bought a gift card to try to use to pay for the food now it's not even allowing me to use that.
621,"I contacted Uber and all Uber could do for me was transfer me to a ""specialized team"" which they have no idea how long it can take to even get the problem situated."
621,They wouldn't even offer me a refund for a gift card that I can't use.
621,For some reason the app isn't working on my phone.
621,That's alright though I will call every single day until my situation is resolved.
621,So great of a company to offer this kind of solution and steal 25 dollars from me rather then offering me my refund due to the fact that I can't even use the gift card.
621,You don't know the first thing about good customer service and that's real sad.
625,"While the app itself works fine, my husband and I had an awful experience last week while we were on vacation."
625,"We were experiencing problems with our card, which we smoothed out on the bank side but then the app would not allow us to use it."
625,"My husband and I both attempted to chat with customer service, and they didn't seem to have an answer and instead told us they would send the info to a ""specialized team."""
625,"We were in an unfamiliar place, I'm disabled, and my husband had gotten very sick."
625,We had no other way to get food and groceries to our hotel.
625,"And yet, 4 days later, neither of us EVER heard from this ""specialized team"" and we have not received any responses to our support chats whatsoever."
625,"Horrible customer service, and completely unprofessional to ignore us!"
834,"I live in New York and every time I order either something is wrong or something is missing Uber tells me because I ask for a refund ""too many"" times I can't order………….I've contacted support on multiple occasions,seeing that I have a $30 promotion about to end and I wanted to use it but couldn't because my account is locked!!!!"
834,I have been waiting for 3 days for a specialized team to contact and nothing has yet to happen.
834,My $30 promotion ends in 2 days and I have yet to use it.
834,This is utterly sad and I will NEVER pay Uber a cent again!!!!!!
834,!
1188,I've been using door dash for years.
1188,"All of a sudden, my account gets deactivated and my order never goes through."
1188,I was on the phone to get my account reactivated only to get deactivated every time I place an order.
1188,"After several transfers to several departments, no one has a solution other than to ""reactivate and escalate."""
1188,Escalation team said to give them 48 hours to fix it and they will send an email.
1188,"It's been 5 days and my account was deactivated again, no email."
1188,I call again only to get the run around until finally (an hour later) someone tells me the fraud department has to look into it.
1188,I have to wait again until they contact me.
1188,"After several days and no solution, nothing has been resolved."
1188,They just read a script then transfer you to another department so they can deal with you.
1188,I hope no one has to go through this because supposedly not even the supervisor of the highest escalation team can do anything to fix this.
1203,I ordered from a restaurant last Friday when DoorDash app said delivery time is 57 mins.
1203,"But after placing the order, delivery time changed to 80 mins which is too long."
1203,"So within 2 mins, I called the restaurant to cancel the order, but they can't do it via DoorDash."
1203,I so contacted DoorDash agent who helped me cancel the order and also confirmed that the order was cancelled.
1203,"The restaurant also called me twice to confirm I don't want this order and I want to cancel it...But two hours later, DoorDash app said I was charged and the order was completed."
1203,"I believe DoorDash still assigned a dasher to this order and when the dasher showed up in the restaurant, he/she asked the restaurant to prepare for this order."
1203,I contacted the second DoorDash agent.
1203,"The agent confirmed with me that the first agent did help me cancel this order, but there are system errors."
1203,The agent escalated this issue to their escalation team...I waited for more than 24 hours but all I got back from the escalation team is an email written in a standard template by a bot saying that the refund request is not approved by DoorDash's policy...I contacted DoorDash again.
1203,Their supervisor just repeated the same thing to me: your case has been reviewed by our escalation team and your refund request is not approved...Super disappointed about DoorDash.
1203,They ask customers to pay for their own system errors.
1219,The escalation team was suppose to give me a call back after I was told many times by the door dash representatives that they were not allowed to transfer me over to a supervisor in the escalation teams about food I never received.
1219,"They are horrible when it comes to their customer service and all the representatives were no help to me at all when it came to resolving my issues, I was told the escalation teams didn't have a direct number which is completely unacceptable and I will not be doing business with door dash , they never followed up with me or not even a email."
1219,The representative was not helpful and the supervisor never followed up with me after the incident.
1219,"I do not recommend door dash to anyone , Uber eats is provides better customer service for the customers so I will be taking my business to Uber eats where the representatives are more professional and knowledgeable"
226,I have caught them charging higher food costs than they quote on a regular basis.
226,"When you call them out on it sometimes they'll correct it, sometimes they'll say they can't do anything and sometimes they just disconnect because they don't care to help you and are blowing through a massive backlog of upset customers."
226,Terrible business.
226,I hope they get in trouble for all the people they are stealing from.
789,I order from Uber eats on a semi regular basis.
789,"Only minor issues I have experienced, misses sauces, one or two missing items."
789,No big deal.
789,But on my last order when my food arrived the paper bag was soaking and my food fell through and onto the sidewalk.
789,I had cleaned it and through it in the trash at that very moment.
789,After I cleaned up I went through the app to let them know about my issue and they said they could not refund me and there was nothing they can do.
789,All they said was better luck next time.
789,And ended the chat.
789,Truly the worst customer service I have ever experienced.
878,I really like the ability to come to my phone and order phone.
878,I'm disabled so some times I don't have food in the house and have to wait to go grocery shopping so this app comes in handy.
878,"However, something was wrong with the app today and I kept clicking on the condiments I wanted on the food but in stead of adding it would subtract the item above and cancel the one I was on and vice versa."
878,"I ended up ordering fries with no salt, burgers w/o cheese with mustard and ketchup but no mayo I believe."
878,"Bottom line, not the way we like it!!"
878,!
974,I made and cancelled an order and was charged twice for an order i had already cancelled.
974,"I contacted my bank and Uber Eats and they both that it didn't matter that i cancelled the order ""make sure you double check your order before you order."""
974,I WILL NEVER USE UBER EATS AGAIN !
974,This isn't fair they're saying that because their merchant is out of money BUT ITS NOT TRUE BECAUSE I HAD ALREADY MADE AN ALTERNATE ORDER SO STARBUCKS IS T OUT OF MONEY.
974,"Bottom line is they are not here to help you, they are there to make you feel stupid and customer service is bad."
28,I order mcdonalds….
28,"Got a combo, and an extra cheeseburger on the side."
28,Came out to $20 i believe.
28,Im checking the map because my food is taking wayyy too long.
28,The driver isnt even NEAR the restaurant.
28,"It says ""on the way to you"" yet he's driving the opposite direction."
28,"The receipt says my food was finished at 3:22pm,yet i received it at 3:56pm."
28,My food was COLD.
28,"Unedible, And my cheeseburger was made incorrectly."
28,"Ticket said NO PICKLES EXTRA ONIONS, Yet i received no onions extra pickles… (which is the restaurants fault not grubhub)  so anyways i contact ‘support' and told them my entire order was wrong."
28,Even received dr pepper instead of coke.
28,Literally my WHOLE ORDER was poor quality.
28,They gove me a $4.77 refund for EVERYTHING.
28,"Literally stealing money from customers at this point just so your weak employees can cruise around town, then deliver incorrect, COLD food."
28,"Will not be using this app ever again, and will definitely be advising others to not use this poor excuse of delivery services."
64,Grub hub used to be my go to.
64,However why do you allow drivers to pickup multiple orders in various places.
64,That defeats the purpose of arrival times.
64,Lately I've been getting drivers getting my order picking up my food and then are all over town in the opposite direction of my location.
64,Arrival times get changed about 3 times.
64,Then my foods cold and gross.
64,"I understand I can go to the restaurant and pick it up myself, but grub hub if your offering a service and I'm paying for it then do what you say your business does."
64,Also customer service is like talking to a wall.
64,They just wave a $5 coupon to make you basically deal with whatever problem you have.
64,They don't even try to help.
64,Grub hub has gone downhill big time.
175,Absolute terrible customer service.
175,I've had several orders where the drivers go the opposite direction.
175,10-15 minutes go by after the latest delivery time and still no movement.
175,"I reach out to the ""help chat"" and they just drop my order - cancel it and give me a $5 coupon."
175,"Waiting after delivery time 3-4 times just be canceled after the fact makes that awful ""gesture"" terrible customer service."
175,I will not be utilizing their services again.
341,"My Mom ordered from GrubHub yesterday, And all I can say is that they had terrible customer service!"
341,We waited two hours for the person to deliver our food and no one showed up!
341,And last month when she ordered from GrubHub the Woman that was supposed to give us our food Was going the opposite direction!
341,Never ordering from here ever again!
341,😡
1210,"I love using Door Dash, especially when your driver comes directly to your house."
1210,The time is as stated and the food is hot.
1210,"However, when the driver is stopping to drop off other orders, not always from the same place, my order is usually the second delivery."
1210,We have had drivers drop off the other order to our house.
1210,They cannot go back and exchange the order for health reasons.
1210,An hour and a half went by and we were refunded for the meal.
1210,No food!
1210,The delivery takes much more time when they go somewhere else and the food is often cold.
1210,One time I checked to see where the driver was on the road.
1210,The restaurant was fairly close to our home but his route took him in the opposite direction.
1210,I would be willing to give bigger tips if I knew I was the priority.
1137,However their delivery drivers get worse and worse.
1137,"They can't follow instructions, deliver it to the wrong location, are impossible to get ahold of, and then are incredibly rude about helping you when it comes to fixing their mistakes."
1137,I will no longer use the app but beware a lot of restaurants still use doordash as a third party delivery service.
1137,"So even if you order from the restaurant directly, it's doordash that delivers it and then it is even more difficult to fix issues the driver's cause, because the restaurant will tell you to call doordash and doordash will tell you they can't help you since you didn't place the order through their app."
1137,"Granted they are good about issuing refunds, but a lot of the time I don't need or want the money back, I just want my order delivered correctly."
1137,Also the doordash subscription is purposely very easy to sign up for.
1137,I can't tell you how many times I've accidentally hit that button and didn't know it until my account was being drafted.
1137,It happened on my work credit card once and they don't issue refunds so I had to pay my company back the money out of my pocket.
1137,My recommendation is to skip doordash and stick with a different delivery service.
1137,Uber eats has always been great for me.
86,"These delivery apps were incredibly convenient creations, however, it's absolutely ridiculous that they won't let you use promo codes unless you're a brand new customer."
86,"Also, why are items on the menu more expensive than the price directly from the store."
86,"If the price is 30% higher, then why is there a delivery fee?"
86,"If someone would just invent a way for me to get items at menu price and only pay a delivery fee, you could put these shiesty businesses out of business and collect all the business and money for yourself."
86,Think about it people!
187,"GrubHub plus is NOT worth it, half the time it doesn't even give you $0 delivery, and they compensate with an extra service fee anyways!"
187,"If you're paying for +, that should cover the service fee and delivery."
187,"Otherwise there's no point, you're not getting your food any cheaper with grub+."
187,Restaurant selection is slim pickings as well.
187,"Also + doesn't let you use promo codes with it, you either get the perk or the promo it won't let you do both!"
187,Which is wrong.
276,"Not that many places to pick in my area and it definitely needs more promo codes, specially on the weekend were many other delivery apps give at least a 10% off just because it's the weekend."
1304,"When you order delivery, they tack on ""fees and taxes"" onto your order."
1304,"You would imagine this would include the taxes on your food, however, everything on the menu is also raised a few dollars for some apparent reason."
1304,"The food and service is great, there are discounts, promo codes, and such."
1304,But I don't want to pay 30 dollars for 4 chicken sandwiches from Popeyes.
1304,I might as well get chick fil-a at that point.
1304,"..Otherwise, fantastic app, reaches out to multiple restaurants that are difficult to get too, as well as offering a premium that reduces your taxes."
21,I absolutely hate this food app.
21,I will never use again.
21,I actually get free delivery with prime but I won't be ordering through them again.
21,Everytime I order from them my order is either canceled or a couple times it's extremely late.
21,One time I waited over 2 hours for a burrito from a place 10 min away.
21,I kept talking to customer service and they would not tell me if it was something with the restaurant or was it just that the driver was not going to pick it up from the place.
21,Eventually after talking to about 3 customer service reps I canceled the order and went to get it myself.
21,They also didn't want to give me a full refund for waiting over 2 hours when estimated delivery was 30 min.
21,A few other times my order was delivered in the dirt outside my apartment complex.
21,Just left there.
21,GrubHub did nothing for me.
21,Even after sending pics and messages.
21,They need serious work on customer service and driver issues before I will ever use them again.
650,"Having used Uber Eats consistently since 2016, I will be switching over to Doordash or another similar service."
650,"Today, September 21, 2022, I placed an order that never arrived."
650,"My apartment complex can be difficult to navigate, so I gave my driver ample tips on how to locate my apartment, including directions, descriptions of patio furniture, and standing outside to grab her attention."
650,"Despite all this, my order was never received, and I couldn't find it anywhere."
650,"When I reached out to hopefully get a refund, I was told that they couldn't, as my app was out of date."
650,"This was not true, and when i opened another chat."
650,"I was then told that there were ""limitations"" and I could not get refunded."
650,Absolutely awful and I will not return to this app after stealing my money and my food.
1320,I ordered two things from Jollibee.
1320,I check out and everything.
1320,"Jollibee is preparing my order, it was supposed to arrive around 6:00 pm and there's like 43 minutes left."
1320,I notice that my location pin doesn't actually represent where I live.
1320,"I adjust it to my actual location, and now I see that my order is going to take 60-70 minutes??"
1320,"And now I'm wondering if I've been charged again for this ""new"" order(I live in an apartment complex, buildings are like 1-2 minutes away from eachother by car, so it's not like the distance between what doordash put as ""my house"" should've drastically changed the time).This is my first HOUR using doordash, and honestly after I get my Jollibee I'm switching to Grubhub 🤷🏾‍♀️ doorflop"
65,"I use Grubhub through my university's meal plan, and it's been working fine up until yesterday."
65,"Now, I cannot change the payment method between using meal swipes to using regular dining money."
65,"Each time I click it, the options to change pop up for less than 1 second before going away and remaining at the selection I had before, which I don't want."
65,It's making it very hard to get food as many dining locations order through grubhub only.
65,"I think this may be because of the bug update from 6 days ago, but it's made my experience worse."
562,I've been trying to add a payment method to order food for weeks.
562,I've seen promos come and go.
562,Weeks ago I tried to add my card to order food with to only receive a message stating it won't accept it.
562,I gave up and figured I'd try again another time.
562,Weeks have past and I figured I'd try again after seeing a new $30 promo.
562,"To no prevail, it still is not working."
562,"Spoke to 2 customer service reps thru the chat, the first one just asked me for a picture of the promo and than transferred me for some reason to a never ending wait."
562,The second one told me the same copy/paste nonsense the first one did.
562,When I asked for a supervisor they stated that they were the highest level of support and kept refusing to assist me in just simply adding my card to just buy food.
562,Ya know.
562,The purpose for the app.
562,And than ended the chat abruptly without allowing me to respond.
562,Ridiculous customer service.
562,Stop hiring these people who don't care to do the job they're hired to do.
860,Everything is great with this app I really appreciate the fact that we can still order food through somewhere else besides pizza and Chinese but my issue is this why can't I delete any of my old payment methods.
860,It took me 30 minutes to get my order because it kept going back to an old payment method
888,Apple pay doesn't work when i check out an order but will suspiciously work when signing up for Uber One 🤨.
888,why does the app pick and choose what payment methods are valid and when?
888,i want my cash back on my orders like the promotion offers section states.
888,"i keep having to delete and reinstall the app in order for it to work and even then, it's not a reliable of trouble shooting the issue."
888,update the app immediately.
958,Was hard for everyone to figure out how to finish.
958,Credit card form in that flow doesn't dismiss when you tap the payment method.
958,Nor does it have a save or next button at the bottom.
958,Instead it has an X top left which feels like cancel.
958,Not continue.
1151,I have been using this app for several years now and I love using this app.
1151,"Up until recently whenever I try to place an order, I keep getting this message saying ""Whoops, try a different payment method."""
1151,"The first time it happened, I called and spoke to support, they were very helpful, escalated the situation and it got fixed the next day and I was able to use as normal."
1151,"Then about a week later, when I tried to use it again, I got the same error message again."
1151,I contact support through the chat and over the phone and have not been able to get any help.
1151,"There is nothing wrong with my cards, they work everywhere else just fine I have tried Apple Pay, adding different cards, I did an update on my phone and the app, I deleted the app and downloaded again and STILL HAVING THE SAME PROBLEM!!"
1151,"I even bought a gift.card THROUGH THE DOORDASH APP MIND YOU,.redeemed the gift in the app to give myself a credit and I STILL GET THE SAME MESSAGE WHEN TRYING TO PLACE AN ORDER!!"
1151,So I have $25 stuck in the app that I can't even use!!
1151,I have done all the troubleshooting that can be done and still having the same problem!
1151,Hopefully some in upper management sees this review and fixes the issue with app.
1231,"I don't know how this happens but if I just don't pay for dashpass, service is entirely hit or miss."
1231,Maybe you'll get a good driver.
1231,Maybe you'll get the right order.
1231,Maybe if you pay enough in tip your food is actually hot.
1231,(Drivers typically want 50% of the subtotal regardless of distance or size of order)..But if you pay for dashpass everything changes.
1231,Every driver takes multiple orders and yours is last regardless of what you tip.
1231,"On top of that, more times than not, you'll get the wrong order or missing items."
1231,Or your driver will spill your drinks and blame the drink carrier...And what does support do?
1231,DoorDash Credits.
1231,They might tell you they'll refund your payment method.
1231,"But you'll still only get credits back, only useable on DoorDash."
1231,..So if they mess up enough the only way to get your money back is to order again.
1231,And it's going to get just as messed up.
1231,..Besides all of this the prices are entirely wrong for everything.
1231,For every single available item you pay an up charge on the initial price.
1231,Compare any in store price to DoorDash and it's impossible to miss the upcharge on the subtotal.
1231,Add taxes and fees.
1231,Monitor taxes and fees.
1231,Even the monthly $9 DashPass fee doesn't change much of anything from the end user cost per order all considered.
1257,As DoorDash has evolved it has taken on more and more shady business practices.
1257,"Today, if I order say a pizza and a couple sodas but they don't bring the soda."
1257,They will credit your account instead of bringing you what you paid for already.
1257,This way you have to order again and pay the delivery fees and whatever other bloated charge they want to add on.
1257,Sure you could credit back to the original payment method but that doesn't change the fact that you didn't get what you paid for or that you have to pay extra again to get it.
1257,"They have tried to take the responsibility off of them by saying ""it's the stores fault"", ""our drivers don't know""…."
1257,"Well, they used too…."
1257,Then you want me to tip the driver who isn't actually doing anything at all now?
1257,Right………..Like I said….
1257,It used to be good.
1312,I thought it was a bit odd the first time I got a refund for a drink I never got(which happened multiple times I chose to do original payment method so I can get my money back .They say 3-7 business days or something like that and you'll be refunded I usually don't go back to look at my bank statements after that amount of time bc I would forget to but today.I checked to see if I had been refunded my money back and would you believe it I hadn't .So I went back to see if I had ever been refunded for past transactions and no I have not so this entire time I have just been losing money to this app🤦🏽‍♀️
502,Use one of their many competitors.
502,"While traveling to celebrate Rosh Hashana, I attempted to use the ""schedule ahead"" service for about five meals and one small grocery order to be delivered to my hotel front desk over the two days."
502,"The first night I had ordered two, samosas that I planned to eat for breakfast and an entree from another restaurant."
502,"Both said they had been delivered, and I had been charged for both, but the hotel only had one."
502,The driver of the entrée left a note that he couldn't find the place.
502,Apparently that doesn't matter and I had to pay for it anyway because I ordered it in advance (the order was placed over two days from delivery).
502,Absolutely no recourse for a refund.
502,And I didn't have dinner.
502,"I ordered a small grocery order for the following morning, water and 2 bottled coffees to be delivered by 8:20 am so that I could receive it before I left for services."
502,By 8:45 it hadn't arrived.
502,I pushed the help button a number of times- BY THE WAY THERE IS APPARENTLY A HEFTY CHARGE FOR ASKING FOR ASSISTANCE FOR A SCREWED UP ORDER.
502,"So if you do make the mistake of downloading this app, don't push that button."
502,"I had another order for lunch that was supposed to come that afternoon but was canceled with the explanation that ""the restaurant couldn't get your order together, sorry""."
502,"It was at that point I canceled all remaining orders, 3 or 4, switched to Grubhub and had zero problems."
502,I'll not likely ever Uber anything again.
502,Skip this disaster.
1120,I have been using DoorDash for a while now and it's only getting worse.
1120,"Not only is the food a lot more expensive using the app, but the drivers never follow the instructions at all."
1120,I have specific instructions for both home and office and in neither location do they ever read the instructions.
1120,"On top of that, half of the drivers can't speak, or read English, so it doesn't matter if I write instructions on where to leave the food."
1120,"The last time I ordered food, it was for my office, and it explicitly stated to walk inside the building and hand it to me or put it on the front desk."
1120,"Instead, the driver went to the totally wrong door and left the food outside in the cold and rain."
1120,"On top of that, there is no way to adjust the tip or to conveniently take away the tip when they failed to do their job appropriately."
1120,"I'm sorry, but I do not feel I should have to tip a person for not doing an appropriate job in the first place."
1120,"If they can't do their job, they don't deserve tip."
1120,This is coming from a person who worked in the service industry for a very long time.
1120,"There was even one time, when I ordered my food, and the driver brought me the completely wrong order."
1120,"Since it was later in the evening, I was not able to have the food order corrected."
1120,"DoorDash did refund me my money, but I was still screwed on food for that night."
1120,It's just not worth it unless you're in a desperate situation.
1190,I ordered food to be delivered to a hotel where I am staying in NJ.
1190,I was out and hoped to return before the order arrived at the hotel's front desk (per my instructions).
1190,"I received a call from Nelson who explained that he was at the front desk, but no one was manning the desk."
1190,"I was accustomed to deliveries being left on the desk, whether or not someone were present."
1190,Nelson exceeded all requirements and expectations by waiting until the person returned to the front desk to deliver the order.
1190,"In addition, he waited until I arrived, since I told him when he called that I was only a few minutes from the hotel."
1190,AMAZING!!
1190,"After Nelson drove away, the person at the front desk expressed his appreciation for how Nelson handled everything."
1190,"I rarely write reviews, but Nelson was that IMPRESSIVE!!"
1190,!
628,So first time I order UberEATS was McDonald's for a double quarter and 20 piece chicken nuggets and no drink because I can make my own.
628,"When it came, it wasn't long just like 15 mintues wait but when it did came, I opened it up and there was a happy meal."
628,Now I thought they just didn't have any more quarter pounder boxes and used a happy meal instead.
628,"But nope it was not my order, and knew that from the start because there was 3 large cokes too (what?)."
628,I did get chicken nuggets but 4.
628,Pretty much ruined my morning and it was the first time using this app.
628,Now I understand those memes of McDonald's using it's cosmic powers to screw up an order of 2 items.
628,Maybe other places does UberEATS better but oh well.
731,"I order multiple items including chicken nuggets, milkshakes, and a chicken sandwich."
731,"My nuggets had pieces of someone's hair cooked into the batter, as well as I had received the wrong size milkshakes."
731,I contacted customer service as my wife was unable to eat her food due to the foreign hair that she found in the nuggets.
731,"It took customer service over 8 hours to respond to me and then refused to help my issue due to I had already thrown the food away at this point, and they wanted a picture of the hair."
731,Customer service also refused to fix the issue with the milkshake sizes as well.
731,So I basically got inedible food and got skimped on large milkshakes.
731,Uber eats learn how to treat your customers.
6,"Terrible service, terrible customer service."
6,Order from restaurant website it defaulted to grub hub for delivery.
6,I ordered and received a time range for delivery of 6:35-6:45 pm.
6,Order did not arrive until 8:03pm.
6,Food was worse than cold.
6,The app showed driver 45 min away enroute to order.
6,Then showed driver in another parking lot down the road hovering forever.
6,"I messaged driver he said he was ""waiting""."
6,I called restaurant my order was ready.
6,No one was there waiting to pick up.
6,Asked if I could get my food remade as it was ready for quite some time but I would have to reorder and repurchase.
6,Tried to cancel through grub hub.
6,Could never get through.
6,The queue had over 300 people in it.
6,Called driver he was picking up order but had to wait for another persons and couldn't leave until theirs was done.
6,Took him 30 min to get 5 miles down the road the app showed him lost and hovering in random parts of our neighborhood.
6,Food received was cold and soggy.
6,Contacted customer service chat they adjusted the wrong item to refund for $3+.
6,I asked for a full refund.
6,Sent me to a different chat with 100+ in queue just to delete me out of chat completely.
6,Will never use Grub hub again.
6,Door Dash is much more efficient and has better help and customer service.
19,I've never had a good experience with this service and it's always been the drivers fault but today takes the cake.
19,Today we ordered and the order was delayed once which was expected due to how popular the restaurant is but then the order was picked up and then the driver took almost an hour to deliver the food at one point I kept track of his location and it remained stationary in the same spot for over 10 minutes when attempting to contact the driver there was no answer on his behalf.
19,After going to grub hub to report this all they could say was sorry for the service and for the cold food here's 5 dollar credit that expires in 30 days when asking if anything else could be done they said they can't do anything regarding their drivers.
19,There's a lack of accountability with their drivers why wouldn't they be able to cover for them it's their employees not the restaurant's fault.
19,I have now deleted the app and account and now they have lost a user.
23,The app is what it is a food ordering service.
23,"What do you expect to receive from a company that adversities ""customer service""?"
23,Well for me expect that I would order the desired product and that the order would be delivered as expected in a fair time.
23,I order the wait was almost an hour but okay I agreed to the price and the time.
23,Pay the fees and tip 20% of the ticket to the driver.
23,I called the restaurant after the time had passed 3 minutes from latest delivery expectation.
23,The restaurant informed me the food had been waiting on a driver for almost 16 minutes.
23,"I started a text with grub hub and all I got was a cancelled order, five dollar off my next sixty dollar order and a I really apologize for this."
23,This is not the first time it has happened!
23,Just a word and maybe it is just my bad luck with these guys but I will not waste another 1hour of my life to cancel the order and get an apology.
23,"I hate this app, and the customer service which is not!"
25,"So just had a conversation with customer support, I was waiting for my order and it said it would arrive at x time, so I waited and noticed that the driver was at one point just driving in circles near but about 5 blocks from my location, so I thought ok here we go again gps is going to screw things up, I message the driver no response, I call the driver still no response."
25,Now I'm worried so I contact grub hub customer service and ask them to check up on the driver because I'm think maybe they got into an accident or something they are in the middle of the street and haven't moved their gps location in about 10 mins.
25,Well it turns out the gps was just freaking out and the driver was picking up an order for someone else and was waiting for almost 30 mins to pick it up when they could have delivered my food and then gone back.
25,I'm sorry but what kind of backwards algorithm are you folks in grub hub using to determine deliveries.
30,I've been using Grub hub for about an year now and the amount of time my foods been stolen is ridiculous and when you do talk to customer support they think everybody is a child sounds like they are talking down to you then all they do you return your money when food is stolen but not like it won't happen again but yep let me keep throwing my money at an delivery app that takes hours sometimes to deliver due to the fact how lazy there drivers are then you do meet some drivers that are nice and good at what they are doing but I only met 3 in the past year of me using it such a bad experience and customer support does not help this clause at all could at least give me a discount for the next food order after my food been stolen but nope and then get hanged up on twice by not only my driver but also the customer service love to see it and how I do much regret spending even one cent on this garbage app and service
49,I tried grub hub plus.
49,First ordered I ordered the items where prepared incorrectly.
49,Not a huge deal.
49,Just missing condiments on all 3 of your meals.
49,The second order the food was all wrong.
49,Missing items.
49,Incorrect burgers wrong condiments.
49,The only thing they got right was the beverage and sides.
49,The third order when the food arrived it was from a completely different restaurant that we ordered from.
49,We gave the food back to the driver because it wasn't our food.
49,When we contact grub hub they said the have to do research on our Order and can take up to 10 days.
49,They are holding my money with food that wasn't even delivered.
49,So now I might be out of some money and a hungry family.
49,Do yourself a favor and don't order from grub hub.
50,honestly-  NOT the best when it comes to order updates and (if ordered 2 places to be delivered same time - dinner and desert for example- the order get assigned to diff people or the same driver goes back and forth needlessly :(  not good for the drivers!
50,.as well as HALF my orders have been canceled with no reason fraking listed.
50,like how door dash if out of the one item from wendys they just cancel full thing... but at least they listed the reason while they were stil in business ... .otherwise when grub hub does work-  food always still hot when finally does arrive and the drivers are very awesome for doing what they do.
50,hence why system should check in on a few details of operation.
69,If you're not familiar with the process of requesting food on a hand held device….How are you using a phone????
69,Return to the drive thru from hence thou cometh.
69,"Yeah, its getting a bit inflated these days."
69,"And yet, I am still using this age old device to continue working for my corporate overlords with little time to actually clean, prep, and assemble mid day meals."
69,"Tip appropriately, as you realize you could've driven the extra 30+ minutes in traffic to and from the place of food creation."
69,Happy Grub Hubbin'!
92,I have had nothing but problems with uber and door dash.
92,Drivers are always in a rush and don't grab all the good.
92,The companies try to blame the location and I call location and food is still there never picked up.
92,After being ripped off again.
92,I tried grub and gin you knocked it outside of the park.
92,Food was on time.
92,"Piping hot nothing spilled, broken or missing."
92,Thank you so much.
92,Looks like it's grub hub for me
93,My fiancé and I ordered food tonight and decided to go with grub hub.
93,I would've gotten the food myself but I have been sick all week with the flu.
93,We thought that it would be more convenient to have it delivered.
93,It took thirty minutes longer to arrive than it said it would.
93,"When we finally got our food, the packaging was smashed and the food was ice cold."
93,I call grub hubs call center and the most they could do is give me a 5 dollar coupon to use for the next time I use grub hub.
93,I spent 50 bucks on this meal.
93,The best they could do is give me a five dollar coupon.
93,I do not plan on using grub hub again
94,"I ordered nachos from a restaurant late at night as I didn't eat dinner, and the driver said it was dropped off."
94,There was no order on my porch or any of the neighbors.
94,I called grub hub and they refused to contact the driver and the only thing they could offer me was a refund even though it was too late to order anywhere else.
94,They also included a coupon for my next order- which turns out was a lousy 2$.
94,I have no idea why they can't call their employee minutes have supposed drop off and find out where they dropped it off.
94,So infuriating!!!
94,At least DoorDash includes pictures of their drop offs so there is no confusion or scamming.
100,So now my review is one star.
100,"I have a premium subscription to Grub Hub, and I regret signing up."
100,"It was free through my bank, but I will no longer use the service because my orders get canceled and delayed."
100,"I get a credit for the cancellation, but it doesn't compensate for the inconvenience."
100,"..Maybe my first review was too vague, so let me clarify: you would be better off using a better delivery service or getting it yourself if you are non-disabled."
100,Don't waste your time trying to depend on Grub Hub.
100,"..My previous review was two stars, but I knocked it down an extra star for being inconvenienced again by rewriting my review."
110,The restaurant and places listed along with the me yea give me more options than the other food del apps do so shout out to grub hub I get the deals you would get if you go through the drive thru.
110,For example door dash won't have every deal or item you might have when going in person so I love that I know what I want and it's always there.
117,"It took so long for my food to get delivered, it was cold when it finally came."
117,I chose to order because of the fast delivery.
117,The pizza place was great - they were waiting on Grubhub as well.
117,Good thing pizza reheats well...**update: got an email from Grub Hub asking me to contact customer support about my recent experience.
117,"The link they gave me did not work, shocker."
117,"Hopped onto the chat with Dynure, the only response I got was that they had a system malfunction and that is why the link didn't work."
117,No other help offered.
117,Thanks but no thanks Grub Hub.
117,I will stick to ordering from Door Dash.
127,The very first time I ordered from grub hub I had an order with 70 dollars worth of food and a good tip.
127,It was delivering to a well known business right off the  of the main road.
127,I missed a call from the driver and called right back (twice) and got no answer.
127,They never delivered the food because they claimed they couldn't find me.
127,Customer service fought to give my money back.
127,Didn't order again for a while and I've ordered 3 times recently and each time the orders were over an hour late past the time it said it was supposed to be delivered.
128,"This has to be the worst food delivery app, every time I order  grub hub will say order is on its way and ten minutes later I am getting a full refund ."
128,Grub hub messages are not in accord  with the restaurant there only guessing .
128,The driver will call and say the order has not been processed while grub hub will say the driver can't get ahold of you.
128,Grub hub is awful I always give them a second chance and that second chance never comes through i always get my hopes up.
128,I'm done with them they never come through .
135,I try not to use grub hub because of the cost.
135,I'm glad it's an option for delivery when necessary.
135,I hate the idea of ordering for pick up.
135,The restaurant gets nailed for a fee.
135,Grub Hub gets paid for doing nothing.
135,It's very hard to turn a profit without getting nailed for a big fee.
135,If you are ordering for pick up you should call or use the restaurants web site.
135,When you order on Yelp it goes through Grub Hub too.
153,Grub Hub has made it super easy to order from a wide variety of my favorite delivery restaurants.
153,"The app gives fairly accurate delivery time estimates...I would prefer if Grubhub included a section on whether a restaurant is capable of dealing with food allergies, what the protocol is, and then allow customers to indicate if that protocol is necessary."
167,"Not sure what's happened post-Covid, but every single restaurant I want to order from is shown as ""closed"" on the app."
167,"They aren't closed, they just aren't participating at peak dinner hours, or sometimes not at all."
167,"I went on Door dash and the restaurants are open there, so clearly restaurants don't seem to like grub hub."
167,"Also, so many menus are limited compared to ordering direct from the restaurant."
167,I paid $10 for membership and for what?
167,I still had to go get the food myself.
167,I'm done with Grub!
168,I was hungry and stuck at the terminal in okc with out my car.
168,Grub hub made it possible to get great food fast.
168,Driver was friendly and on time.
168,The food was excellent.
168,I love Freddie's steak burger with bacon.. and their patty melt..
168,I always breakdown and get their out of this world concrete shakes.. i enjoy the pumpkin concrete and banana peanut butter chocolate chunk amazing custard.. thank you Freddie's and Grubhub
180,"Had our driver drop our food then tell us we had to go to customer support to cancel our order told us we would get a refund 3-5 business days and we had a 5 off coupon that we have to use within 30 days and went to door dash instead and I'm not saying this is grub hubs fault but we shouldn't have to order another order and pay additional money for it just so someone could ""drop it "" grub hub should pay for it the second time"
210,Grub hub never rings the bell or texts.
210,They just leave the food and hope you'll wander to the front door and see it's there.
210,"You can put a note on your order, you can click the little check that says ‘text me', you can tip $10…..but it doesn't matter."
210,Your food will sit there outside and you'll never even know it.
210,This has happened over and over and over again.
210,Completely insane way to run a delivery service.
210,Bye grub hub.
225,Horrible service from this service.
225,"Ordered food from a restaurant, waited an hour and the food still hadn't been picked up."
225,"When we called to get a refund, the lady said the restaurant had to."
225,"But when we called the restaurant, the owner said grub hub had to issue the refund."
225,I'm extremely unhappy with how unhelpful Grubhub was.
225,They offered no account credit or any kind of help.
225,..Use doordash or literally any other food delivery app.
225,This one is garbage.
228,I ordered from a place called hooties burger bar.
228,I get my food and it's just hooters.
228,Had I known it was hooters I wouldn't have placed the order to begin with because hooters is one of those places where the food is only good if you're right there.
228,"The lettuce was slimy and transparent, bread was soggy as well as the pickles, and the fries were cold and hard."
228,Completely inedible.
228,This was a $50 order and grub hub only gave me a $7 coupon to rectify the situation.
228,I'll be sticking with door dash.
232,Each time we have ordered from this app the deliveries are prompt and the drivers are always courteous.
232,We will continue to use Grub Hub for all our delivery orders!
232,Thanks for the great service!
232,!
246,My other apps didn't always have drivers available which was frustrating but so far grub hub has come through.
246,So far.
251,I have grub hub plus and it's just not worth it.
251,Instead of charging you delivery they just Jack up all the prices on every item.
251,The delivery service is god awful since going to plus and instead of giving you a legitimate refund they give me a small fraction of what you paid and tell you you have 30 days to order through the app to receive the refund.
251,It's a pointless cycle.
251,Just say no.
252,I had my account hacked and someone changed the email address associated with my original account and is (still!!)
252,.
252,using my personal credit card in my account to order food from another state.
252,I tried contacting Grub Hub immediately.
252,"It has been 72 hours, ive spoke with at least 3 different individuals and it hasnt beeen resolved."
252,Grub hub does not care about their customers or protecting private information.
304,Food deliveries always late no matter how much time is provided .
304,You could order food first thing in the morning for dinner and even after all that time it is late.
304,Don't plan on it for conferences when you have a specific lunch period.
304,".. Hey Grub Hub, forget about your 5 dollar credit for being late and just deliver it on time"
329,I have Grub Hub plus that is supposed to include free delivery.
329,"Instead of big delivery fees, they charge additional ""service fees""."
329,Door Dash does not.
329,The only time I order through Grub Hub these days is if I cannot find the restaurant I want on Door Dash and I cannot go pick up the order.
425,"I'm sick of apps asking for my review, I have yet to run into a app that works perfect and doesn't cost me money."
425,"Grub hub jacks up the food prices and adds on fees plus their ""monthly"" charge to have access to the plus features."
425,For those that want delivery and don't mind way overpaying for the convenience.
425,"So yes, since this how these apps are- one star it is."
497,First time using since signing up for the Plus program.
497,"Finished the order only to be told, with no advance notice, that the restaurant ""does not participate."
497,Amateur hour at Grub Hub.
497,"Plus is a real reputational minus...I heard from GrubHub about my review, offering to help."
497,The dopes referred me to a section that does not exist in their app.
497,From bad to worse.
524,"I had 2 orders that cancel back to back and after waiting over 3.5 hours for delivery, I get a message from Uber eats on how sorry they are, here's $5 for your trouble..You can call Uber eats, but they have no way of elevating a situation like this which I have experienced many times  Customer service will apologize over and over, but they can not elevate this particular situation above a low level supervisor's level so top management has no way to track their own company's service."
524,"Not the type of company I would want to invest in, personal opinion only."
524,.I am old and no longer drive.
524,I live on a fixed income so this service is extremely expensive for me.
524,There are many people like me that depend on services like this.
524,Fortunately there are alternative service such as Grub Hub and Door dash.
524,".If management responds to this review,, I will reevaluate my position, otherwise, I will not use this company's service anymore."
524,"Check your 401k, how can a company make money if the cannot track their own performance."
524,"If I am wrong, I would very much like to know."
524,"Waiting for a response,  patiently of course."
700,My family ordered a pizza using Uber Eats service.
700,Our pizza took a good amount of time and came ICE COLD and tasted rubbery.
700,We contacted Uber Eats immediately and was told sorry there is nothing they can do.
700,So you pay extra to order through their service for convenience but they accept zero responsibility and told me to contact the establishment.
700,The establishment loses money because some of their price goes toward Uber Eats.
700,So basically the customer pays extra to use their service for convenience and the establishment pays toward Uber Eats losing profit but Uber Eats accepts zero responsibility that they are serving anything with quality.
700,It's absolutely horrible business service.
700,"Use Grub Hub, Instacart or just order through the establishment."
700,Uber Eats is trash.
716,I had few missing items on my Uber eat order.
716,"I called the restaurant, they told me to see with Uber eats."
716,"After a long back and forth with robots answering, they said my purchase was not eligible for refund and that my account had too many refund requests...This was my first time asking for a refund."
716,I was shocked to hear that their first answer was the quality of my account which was they based on wrong information.
716,"They would not bring this up to  a supervisor ( of course, this only a robot answering always the same crafted response )..This is just too risky to order on this site and prefer grub hub for their management of the same issue"
726,"Cancelled, orders day after day, shortly after trying out uber eats ."
726,"Left Grub Hub because of their late, cancelled, wrong address deliveries."
726,Uber Eats has been worse.
726,"You order, says being prepared, arriving by, latest arrival etc."
726,1/2 hr to over an hour later you get a cancellation order alert leaving family with no dinner.
726,Plus you lose the promotion for that order.
726,Reaching Customer Service is often additional long waiting time or not reached at all.
726,Trying them out this free month for their Uber Eats plus type program.
726,So far a failure.
726,Just ordered again and we'll see if I get a third straight canceled order alert with no time to choose an alternative.
726,Ugh!
844,"I have tried Post mates,DoorDash and Grub hub."
844,"When I say I prefer Uber Eats, I MEAN IT!"
844,"From the way they have deals you can use in the app, the prices being affordable and not outrageously priced, the drivers being some of the fastest and friendliest people, and my meals always arriving correctly!"
844,It's easy to say I will continue to use Uber Eats for my food delivery needs.
932,Uber eats has been progressively going downhill.
932,I haven't received a fully correct order in at least 8 months.
932,"The issue is, they don't refund customers for your charges nor discounts applied, even when deliveries are wholly wrong."
932,"You get the same copy and pasted message ""rest assured, we will be forwarding this to our team""."
932,It doesn't change.
932,"Please save your time and money by ordering with seamless, grub hub, caviar, or any other food delivery app - I and those I know haven't had a problem on any app other than Uber eats"
1105,"I think it's stupid you can only use Apple Pay, Venmo, or PayPal to pay for your order."
1105,What happened to just putting your debit in.
1105,"No one used Venmo, rarely does anyone use Apple Pay."
1105,I never used this app and I never plan on it now.
1105,Ig I'll go to grub hub or another competitor who allows ppl to use their debit card.
1105,I mean that's what's it for isn't it?
1105,Very disappointed
1163,Do not drive for these people being paid the bare minimum for orders is insane !
1163,Not only that I have requested my account to be deactivated due to the fact that the entire customer service is full of idiots !
1163,I turned the app on mind you I have 200 completed orders for them !
1163,I pull up to a place that doesn't have any of the customers items so I requested it be canceled saying Popeyes is out of the order the girl in the chat canceled the next order I accepted in stead !
1163,So now a customer is upset with her order canceled for no reason and the one I needed canceled was still there after being told I wuld be compensated for the one she mistakenly canceled I realized that compensation wasn't there called them and wen I tell you they cannot comprehend a single thing in life !
1163,!!!!
1163,U will have to fight them for your money just to be told they not paying you then why was I told by two different reps I should be receiving payment I didn't make them tell me this nor did I ask for these orders to be canceled incorrectly now I have wasted my gas and time !
1163,Thank god for Uber eats and grub hub !
1163,Because this app is the lowest !
1163,!!
1163,!
1253,I started DoorDash a couple months ago.
1253,"Out of the 12 orders I made, 3 were incorrect."
1253,"Each time they told me I would ""get a full refund"" because they are ""so sorry this happened."
1253,"""..This most recent time I didn't even get my order."
1253,I talked to DoorDash.
1253,"They told me they weren't refunding me, then ended their chat."
1253,I entered chat again and they immediately ended it.
1253,I entered the help chat again.
1253,Same thing.
1253,"I entered it again, and the person told me there was a glitch and I was charged incorrectly."
1253,Then said they wouldn't deliver the food or refund me.
1253,Then ended chat.
1253,"A ""manager"" sent me an email apologizing and then, said they wouldn't refund me."
1253,.So I decided to look at my refund history.
1253,They didn't refund anything...I'm down quite a bit of money from lies...Don't use this app.
1253,"They literally steal your money and their customer service is horrible...They asked me to wait 24 hours to ""research and get back to me"" and after 24 hours never once reached out."
1253,Now the app says my issue was resolved and I can't open a ticket again...Have to go to go to my credit card company and hopefully I can get refunded back what they stole...Don't ever use DoorDash.
1253,Grub hub at least has decent customer service.
1329,"Ive been using door dash for over a year now, and have not placed a single order that didnt have any problems."
1329,There were multiple times where they could not find a dasher and my order was set back about a half hour- an hour.
1329,"Also, the cancellation to credits only works if you have the dash pass, so I did end up lossing over $40 on an order because of that."
1329,"The delivery time is always way off, and the items in the order are almost always wrong."
1329,Not to mention they leave out and up charge everything on menus.
1329,Im overall very disappointed knowing that grub hub and uber eats are about 10x more accurate and overall much better.
120,I don't use grubhub that often; maybe once every two months when i forget to bring lunch to work.
120,"But when i do use grubhub, I'm milked for every penny I have."
120,I ordered two 5-piece chicken tendies and it's original price was $24.
120,"Grubhub then slams me with a delivery fee, a service fee, tax, and tip."
120,The price doubled to $44… for 10 chicken tenders… and to remove the delivery fee you need a subscription for $8 a month.
120,Who uses grubchub that much to disqualify the service fee from saving an extra dollar?
120,"Grubchub is over priced and full of disappointment, I'll gladly not use the app."
645,Five days ago I ordered pizza.
645,The ham tasted horrible.
645,I threw both pizzas away (30 bucks).
645,Then I got sick.
645,I slept for 15 hours shortly after.
645,I wrote to Uber but the told me they couldn't refund my money.
645,I was sick for three days.
645,Today I ordered 25 bucks of breakfast.
645,I was handed two paper bags.
645,"As soon as I got inside, one bag broke (not mr fault, the juice and coffee had both spilt in the bag)."
645,The food was ruined.
645,"I spent an hour cleaning the floor, my clothes and taking a shower instead of being in a business meeting."
645,I wrote to Uber.
645,They haven't answered.
645,"They are seriously terrible, and since you don't deal directly with the restaurant, you have no recourse."
645,App works just like all the other apps in the space...Btw the 5 star ratings seem to be wrong.
645,"When you read the actual review, most are negative."
568,I can't remember the last time I got an order that was completely correct.
568,"My order is wrong pretty much every single time, and it's wrong in infuriating ways."
568,"You only get refunded a small percentage when there are missing items, so be prepared to pay even more on top of the apps already high price hikes."
568,Drivers also hardly ever deliver to my place despite clear instructions.
568,"This is an overpriced and difficult experience and it's probably better to use a different delivery app...UPDATE (10/24): I am officially done with this app and it is clear that they treat everyone — customers, drivers, and restaurants — terribly while reaping huge profits."
568,"Recently, I ordered from a restaurant the following items: a side item that came with a side of sauce, lo mein, potstickers, and a drink."
568,Guess what came?
568,"Only the side order, but with no sauce."
568,And the won't refund me.
568,Tons of money down the drain.
568,..Send your business elsewhere.
622,"my boyfriend is a driver and he just completed 3 deliveries, but only made $8 total so far."
622,"people don't seem to be tipping and with all the other fees Uber takes out of the driver's pay, it's becoming unrealistic to be a driver anymore."
622,"gas for those 3 deliveries would cost more than what he made, so really he is taking a financial loss just to work for this company."
622,"..if you don't want to require a tip from customers, maybe consider giving up a small percentage of fees you take and using that money to increase the minimum pay per delivery for drivers."
622,"it would also be nice if you did more of those events where you earn $5 extra for every 3 deliveries, etc."
1224,"There is no way to search a specific stores menu-the search functionality just searches EVERY restaurant, not the one you click on."
1224,"For stores that have long menus, it's so frustrating to endlessly be scrolling up and down AND if the item is out of stock, rather than DoorDash just marking it as out of stock, it disappears from the menu-so you just end up scrolling more."
1224,"Honestly, this seems like a design choice they made to get people to ""discover"" more items to add to cart."
1224,"..Finally, the compensation they offer unless you select the ‘item is missing' when an item delivered is incorrect will be such a small percentage of the item that it in no way covers a replacement or even your time if you need to reorder for allergy/preferences."
509,My large taco order to help a friend who was running low on food at his party was never delivered.
509,I tipped up front to boost the odds my order arrives quickly and safely.
509,"Then, all of a sudden, the app alerts me that the food was delivered."
509,"Uhhh, no."
509,I'm pacing the front yard in the sub-freezing weather to ensure a quick handoff.
509,Not a car in sight.
509,"Using the app's map,  I saw the driver, Ryan, about 2 blocks away."
509,I frantically tried to call him via the app but after multiple attempts was never able to get thru.
509,"As soon as I heard ringing, the call would be disconnected."
509,"Over and over again, that was my experience."
509,Then the order in the app converted to delivered and that's that.
509,"I kept trying to call and searched for helpful menu options, which were limited, until I suppose even Uber fatigued and suddenly presented me with a refund option that wasn't there before."
509,I requested a refund but only the food cost was refunded.
509,"The driver happily cruised away with a tip, and presumably 24 tacos."
509,"..Needless to say, the party guests were shocked at how easy it was to be scammed by an Uber Eats driver with no repercussions."
509,"I'm done with Uber Eats until I hear they have scamming under control...Frankly, even refunding the tip isn't enough."
509,The stress and hassle and embarrassment of chasing down the driver via the app only tor walk back inside empty handed isn't worth it.
1012,I made an order for a pretty large group of people at work.
1012,"After multiple delays the delivery personally finally showed up at the drop off location, marked my order ""Delivered"", and left."
1012,Shortly after she messaged me saying that she didn't bring the food because the restaurant cancelled the order.
1012,..I sent this to Postmates support along with screenshots of the message from the delivery person herself saying that she never got the food.
1012,"After a lot of back and forth they said they were sorry but because the delivery driver showed up at the delivery location, they were unable to give me a refund."
1012,..I paid for food not for someone to show up at the drop off location empty handed.
1012,This is after spending thousands on large orders through the app.
1012,"Very disappointed with this level of service, and I won't be using this app again."
1044,Had a problem with my pick up order.
1044,Food was never made so I left the restaurant empty handed.
1044,"Oh well things happen, I'll just request a refund."
1044,So I thought.
1044,"But here 48 hours later and after initiating 5 email/chat messages with differnt customer service agents, after submitting 6 screenshots for evidence including the pending charge on my cc, I'm no closer to customer service even locating my order to refund or cancel the transaction."
1044,I'll continue ordering food but I Def won't use postmates / Uber eats ever again.
1167,I have one day left here in the state that I'm in this app has f'd me over multiple days in a row when trying to order the app crashes or freezes.I just want to have one final great last night with the bois and order a few drinks to the place that were at.
1167,I can open restraints but when I open a liquor store the app freezes.
1167,I ordered two times the two nights before this and the order never arrived both times no compensation except for 5 dollars and I have to wait a week for my money back so I can't order it.
1167,My friend is ordering it tonight and the app keeps saying payment issue there is no issue paying the app is at fault.
1167,There are more than 10 instances things like this have happened.
1167,DoorDash has pretty much been ruining my life for the past year with expectations being crushed and high hopes for nothing
1180,"This app used to be great, and I'm sure its great for a lot of people that you can order from grocery stores, gas stations, liquor stores, etc but now I've got to scroll through 50 a list that's forever long that has one local restaurant for ever 10 things that aren't a restaurant and there's no easy way to filter it out unless you filter for a particular type of food."
1180,They should take a page from Uber Eats' book and put buttons at the top that will filter for just restaurants.
1180,..They also need to figure out a way to limit how many different stores a single store can list.
1180,"For example, Meijer has one for their main store, then another store just for Meijer liquor, then another store for Meijer Pet and all three pickup at the same location."
1180,They could and should consolidate that and that would be a few less things you'd have to scroll through.
507,"I like the convenience of using Uber Eats, however, there's been too many times where my order was either missing items or incorrectly prepared."
507,"Now in this situation, of course most people will contact support for assistance, to request a refund of those missing items or incorrect order."
507,"The problem with this is, Uber gives a cap on how much they will refund over a period of time."
507,"..Now, I understand there's limits, due to help prevent abuse, but if you request a picture and description of the issue and it's provided, then something should be done to help the consumer."
507,"Say I ordered a chicken sandwich and received a hamburger, and I clearly show that I received something different, then saying you can't provide a refund and you'll reach out to the merchant to help prevent it from happening again, doesn't help the consumer."
507,"This penalizes the consumer and makes them less likely to use the service again, due to something outside of their control...Some people spend a lot of money on delivery food to have food missing or incorrectly prepared food, only to be stuck with no solution from the service provider."
507,"I nearly signed up for an annual subscription, I'm soooo glad I didn't."
507,Be careful for anyone that does sign up for the annual plan to save money.
507,"Once you reach your cap on support, you won't get any more assistance with messed up orders."
752,I freaking love Uber eats I love getting my food it comes fast I eat it I love it and then I do it again and repeat and repeat if you're not using Uber eats you are crazy what's wrong with your freaking head come on you can just get on your phone hit a couple buttons Wala there's a chicken sandwich baby baby baby baby yeah baby baby I love it love it now Uber eats for life till I die I love Uber and then I can get a ride come on it doesn't get any better than that
1149,Very disappointed.
1149,We placed an order for two chicken sandwiches from our favorite local restaurant.
1149,"Our delivery driver knocked on the door and when we opened it, there was a pizza left on our porch from a different restaurant close by."
1149,"We tried calling DoorDash, and after waiting on hold for an excessive amount of time and going back and forth between people, we were refunded."
1149,"I know it seems silly, but we had just had pizza from the restaurant the pizza was from, and we really wanted the sandwiches we ordered!"
1149,"Unfortunately, that restaurant was closing in 5 minutes after we were finished with the phone call with DoorDash (which took a very long time, at least 45 minutes), so they weren't taking anymore orders."
1149,I'm not able to write a review on the dasher because the order was placed through the restaurant's website who (I guess) uses doordash for delivery.
1149,"I called the restaurant and they said they were having trouble with doordash today, but there was nothing they could do (which is incorrect, and part of the reason I'm writing this)."
1149,If there's any way I can review the driver please let me know.
1149,I haven't had many problems with doordash but this was lame.
1191,I've had the dash pass for 2+ years and after a certain point you just don't get anymore compensation.
1191,"If somebody steals your food, Your money is gone you get no money back."
1191,"If your item is substituted to something you don't want, You can't get a refund."
1191,I ordered a philly chicken sandwich and they substituted it for a FISH BURGER.
1191,I didn't agree to that and they said i wont get my money back for it.
1191,I ordered twice a day almost everyday and it's like they don't compare how much you order to how much of your things gets taken/missing.
1191,This is definitely the last time i'm using this app because spending money on something you never got over and over again is the most frustrating thing.
1191,It's like throwing your money in the trash.
1191,You get no food and your money gets taken 😂😂😂.
1191,"If you're new to the app they will compensate you but if you're not, it's over with whenever something happens with your order."
1191,YOU get punished for it.
1191,Terrible!
79,"i use postmares, uber eats, grubhub and doordash."
79,i pay for premium for all of these services.
79,grubhub is by far the lowest end of them all.
79,"out of 10 deliveries, 8 of the delivery drivers do not speak english."
79,"one of my drivers did not contact me and just marked as delivered and after contacting support, they jst refunded my order and expected me to be content with that."
79,"grubhub has the lowest standards for their drivers, worst app ui and i would happily pay slightly more to use other delivery apps."
79,edit: why are you asking me to contact support again?
79,"ive already contacted support and tried multiple times after my order to try to get in contact but you guys did nothing, so… ?"
79,?
163,Hire people who can speak English and can communicate thoroughly.
163,Some of your drivers also expect for the customer to meet them at their vehicles to receive our food.
163,"Which is backwards when we pay for ""delivery"" to the home."
163,Which mean front door of your home.
163,Better training for drivers to provide better customer service
339,This app is ok in ordering your food.
339,"When an error took place, Grubhub left me on hold for over 45 minutes, and never bothered to pick up."
339,"I had to notify the restaurant not to deliver my food, because grubhub has foreign employees who claim they speak English to get the job, but can't comprehend English while trying to interact with customers."
339,Grubhub never apologized or offered any discounts.
339,They lost me.
593,Just Use door dash.
593,"I decided to use my one night off to order food in, just for my delivery man to steal my food and gas light me about how he couldn't speak English, even though when I spoke to him in Spanish, he still insisted that he could not understand me."
593,THATS not even the worst part.
593,"When I called customer service (multiple times), they sent me to automated voice recording and when I was able to talk to a real person, they told me I was not eligible for a refund due to ""too many refund requests"" when I had never made one in the past."
593,"When I asked to give me dates of these so called refund requests, they would not."
593,"Moral of this is I spent over 100$ for food since Uber eats upcharges, and has a tip fee, and i had to order all new food since my order never arrived."
593,.I was absolutely horrified by the way the delivery driver treated me and how the company has treated me.
935,I placed an order where they charged me nearly $20 of fees on a $30 order.
935,I requested a special side to be included.
935,"Just to make sure I Calle free restaraunt, they didn't answer, the driver, he didn't answer nor did he speak English."
935,Finally I called Uber Eats support and they said they wouldn't do anything and to go kick rocks.
935,"For the massive fees they charge they provide awful service, I'll never order through them."
935,Rip off artists and rude people all around.
935,Scummy.
935,I have an open PayPal dispute right now as a last resort.
1177,"There was a print that said if I added the Dash Pass to my order I could save a little over $4, so I did."
1177,It also said that I would get a 30 day free trial and at the end of the :0 days I would be charged $9.99 per month.
1177,"When I placed my order nothing was deducted from the total so I contacted customer support…the guy who ""helped"" me didn't know how to speak English well, had a lot of spelling and grammatical errors, and just represented himself and the company very poorly due to the above and his overall tone."
1177,I was honestly shocked.
1177,"He decided to call me because he couldn't understand ME, so when we spoke I reiterated everything that had happened, to which he told me he refunded me some money and canceled my Dash Pass."
1177,I check my account a few days later to see not only no refund but also a $9.99 charge for the Dash Pass.
1177,Needless to say I have deleted their app and will save myself a lot of money by going to get my food myself.
1177,"These companies don't care about us, they only care about what they can get away with."
1184,Don't waste your time!
1184,I live in an apartment the driver got lost.
1184,She then proceeded to tell me I had to speak Spanish.
1184,I cannot speak Spanish beautiful language but I can't speak it.
1184,So to be told she can't bring my food because I can't direct her in Spanish to my house is absolutely ridiculous!
1184,Door Dash doesn't do anything to make it right.
1184,Didn't give me credit after they said they would.
1184,So I had no dinner and my food never came.
1184,They lied and said they were going to escalate the issue and see me an email.
1184,Both of those things were a lie.
1184,"Go to another company I have had the delivery people drop my food at the wrong house, not speak English, scream at me, make me meet them in my development to pick food up, steal my food."
1184,Go with a better company this one is a scam.
1184,They won't give you credit or money back.
1184,I went to bed without dinner and nothing has been resolved.
1184,Extremely disappointed I'll never order from them again.
1213,I usually order from the web page for Doordash but decided to use the app.
1213,"I don't know what is going on, but now my orders are always missing something or the dasher just doesn't show up."
1213,I waited 45 min for an order that was supposedly taken to the wrong address.
1213,"Dasher did not follow the instructions to text when arrive, it seems she wanted to keep the food."
1213,I spoke to her over the phone 1x and she still supposedly ended up at the wrong address again and left my food there.
1213,Now I have to wait another 45 mins.
1213,"For a redelivery, I will not be using this app again."
1213,Oh and when I called customer service the rep could barely speak English and was speaking some words in Chinese.
1213,Will only order from a browser from now on too many problems using this app!..Stuck on review store page and will not let me exit out to review my new order
1288,Don't waste your time!
1288,I live in an apartment the driver got lost.
1288,She then proceeded to tell me I had to speak Spanish.
1288,I cannot speak Spanish beautiful language but I can't speak it.
1288,So to be told she can't bring my food because I can't direct her in Spanish to my house is absolutely ridiculous!
1288,Door Dash doesn't do anything to make it right.
1288,Didn't give me credit after they said they would.
1288,So I had no dinner and my food never came.
1288,They lied and said they were going to escalate the issue and see me an email.

40,"GrubHub places orders, but it does not check the response from the restaurant to see if the order has been received and will be processed successfully."
40,They only time they confirm is when the driver arrives at the restaurant and reports a problem with the restaurant?
40,"!..On two separate occasions, I tried placing order to a local cafe that Google Maps shows is open...On both occasions, GrubHub falsely reported that my order was complete, and it was on its way."
40,"On both occasions, 10 minutes before my food was supposed to arrive I received an alert that my order was canceled and I would receive a refund...I got no further communication the first time this happened."
40,"However, I got a phone call the second time."
40,I asked GrubHub why did they wait until my food was supposed to arrive to tell me there was a problem.
40,The rep then shared that GRUBHUB DOESN'T KNOW THERE IS A PROBLEM WITH THE ORDER/RESTAURANT UNTIL THE DRIVER ARRIVES TO PICKUP THE ORDER!!!
40,!..It is beyond ridiculous to expect customers to find it acceptable that GrubHub doesn't do a verification via API that the order is being processed.
40,Do the Product Managers pay attention to the customer experience?
40,!
508,I wrote this review a year and a half ago.
508,I STILL cannot understand for the life of me why this broken app gets anywhere near 5 stars.
508,Even the bad reviews have five stars.
508,I am at a loss.
508,This time I came back to point out that they removed the option to add a note of instructions.
508,Now I can't tell them to hold the lettuce.
508,"Maybe it's all the people in the US, because Uber would rather invade and colonialize Latin America than actually try to fix their app."
508,It's well and truly baffling that they get this much praise.
508,One example is that the app can't figure out where I am nor where places are.
508,Either it puts the delivery guy a block away and doesn't let me fix the location or the application simply changes the location to somewhere I am not.
508,I literally had to add a location in Google maps and name it as if it were my own business in order to get them to come to that point on the map.
508,"Worse yet it's profoundly frustrating that there is no in app support or chat, the only possible place I have ever gotten a single helpful response is on Twitter."
508,Twitter is a social media application not a support platform and now it's been tanked by Elon.
508,"I guess when you manage to undercut everyone out of the market and secure the back pockets of politicians through US imperialism and begin dominating the industry, you have zero incentive to fix anything or provide support."
682,I use Uber Eats primarily when working conferences or other all-day events when going to pick up food myself is not an option...The good news is that it's convenient and offers lots of options.
682,"..There are several things that make me want to delete the app, however."
682,..The biggest issue is freshness; drivers almost always pick food up late so it's been sitting at the restaurant for 20 minutes before it even gets out the door.
682,"I tip well, so I can't understand why this happens consistently...It also drives me crazy that you can't search or sort by distance."
682,I don't want food from a restaurant that's 9 miles away.
682,It will be gross by the time it arrives.
682,"I have to use Google Maps to see nearby restaurants, then see if they're on Uber Eats...Drivers forget to bring beverages probably 75% of the time."
682,And they bring napkins and utensils about 10% of the time.
682,"..Really, the only reason I don't delete the app is that Grubhub is somehow worse."
4,This company is one of the worst I've ever dealt with.
4,Late all the time.
4,Often the math doesn't add up.
4,They gave me a $5 promo for being late but it only gave me $1 and change off.
4,Sketchy.
4,The order will come to one thing but they charge the bank another.
4,I canceled last yr but ended up with a free year long plus membership then I got hurt so can't drive so I use it a lot now.
4,It's rare I have a seamless order.
4,Just now I'm waiting for my food for an hr get a call from a man I couldn't understand and he just hangs up on me when I said sorry I didn't catch that.
4,Very thick accent in a very loud call center.
4,Then I see my order was canceled I had promos on the order from the last time they messed up and now those aren't valid.
4,"I reordered from another restaurant and the driver didn't bring the drinks,  give us forks or sauce."
4,Also knocked when I said to no contact.
4,I had one driver last year flip off my camera for absolutely no reason.
4,I tip 25%.
4,I definitely won't be using it after my free year ends this February.
4,I was formally a paid Grubhub + customer.
4,I order out probably 15 to 20 times a month due to my physical pain.
4,It's easier than cooking and cleaning dishes.
4,But I'll  find other ways like pizza delivery or DoorDash.
4,Which isn't much better but still better.
58,"There is this issue with my account where I'll pay for grubhub + and when I try to place an order, my account says I have no grubhub plus membership- essentially just stealing my money."
58,When I contact customer service regarding the issue they say they have no record of me being a grubhub + member but can refund me the charge.
58,How does that make sense?
58,There is clearly a charge for the amount of the membership and yet they say they don't know anything about it.
58,".Not only that but whenever I try to place an order (without) the membership, it gets immediately cancelled."
58,I've also contacted them about the issue but they say it must be a glitch.
58,They give me no solution.
58,.I've switched to DoorDash since then.
284,I never write review but this app has got me incredibly frustrated.
284,I spoke to multiple representatives on chat and was told my order was on the way and it never arrived.
284,They finally cancelled it after about 2 hours...The GrubHub guarantee is baseless.
284,They can keep their 5 and 7 dollar vouchers and buy themselves small fries at McDonald's.
284,"Never using it again, app is going to be deleted."
284,What a waste of a plus membership.
511,I signed up for the plus membership which promises free delivery on most places.
511,"When browsing places to eat I found one that had the plus membership symbol, and stated free delivery."
511,However at checkout I was being charged a delivery fee.
511,I spoke to a support rep. and supplied them with pictures of the app stating no delivery fee on the front page and also at checkout where one was being applied.
511,The rep. assured me that the way it works is that I will be refunded the delivery fee once the delivery has been completed.
511,I voiced my confusion with such a business model to which they just kept reassuring me I could place my order and I would be getting my money back.
511,It has been a week since and I was never refunded so I contacted a rep over the phone this time to which they told me the initial rep was wrong and I won't be getting my money back.
511,I then asked to speak to a higher up as they now scammed me into placing an order that I told them I would not be ordering if I had to pay the delivery fee since it was almost as much as the order itself.
511,The new rep assured me their supervisor would contact me by the end of the night.
511,That was 3 days ago.
511,I even saved the chat log and would gladly supply it to them if they actually bothered to contact me.
511,"I will not be ordering from this service again, scammers."
831,I ordered from a local restaurant and was told by my driver it would be a 30+ minute wait on top of the wait time i already had and was asked by my driver to cancel the order.
831,"After canceling the order i was charged for the entirety of the order stating ""the food had already been made"" when contacting customer support they said i had to pay for it even tho their driver said to cancel, i even provided proof and they still did not care."
831,I had a Uber plus membership and frequently ordered from there.
831,I have taken my business to DoorDash.
319,"I tried to order food 2 different days and both days, there were no drivers, my delivery time kept getting pushed back over and over again and their only solution was to refund me and offer a free trial of GH+… 🙄 like i would actually want to try to order anything with them again!"
319,Door dash is much better so I'll be using them from now on.
463,I has a free tripa for Grubhub plus.
463,My very first order was 40 minutes late.
463,I only received half my meal and none of my sons meal.
463,And I tried to use my free trial today w my order being 15$.
463,They cancelled it.
463,Revoked my free trial and then my order was now 21$ to process.
463,Which was successful of course.
463,I should've stuck to Uber eats.
463,Learn from my mistake.
613,"When I say they rob you blind for the free trial they do , you will be charged 9.99$ even though you weren't supposed to and then they say they are aware of the bugs charging peoples account and could basically care less becasue they void it , so the fact you have to wait 2-3 business days for your money back in my opinion seems like blind Robbery, I'm not an atm or a loan company whether it was voided or not, and then the customer service you will get is horrible and I mean terrible , I have a whole recorded session where I was chat ended 3 times by the employees just trying to resolve the issues, never swore once and was totally respectful to them they just ended the chats one by one all three giving trashy short answers and then clicking off."
613,This is my experience so far with them and my last .
668,I've been using Uber eats for a few years now but lately my orders have been arriving late.
668,Today I ordered food that was more than 20 minutes late.
668,My food was cold and my soda was flat.
668,In the past Uber eats has offered a discount on my next order.
668,But lately I have been receiving emails instead to sign up for Uber one or something.
668,"Trying to get me to have a free trial as an ""apology""."
668,It's just a marketing scheme.
668,"I think they are directing the drivers to purposefully delay the food to either get people to pay the ""priority"" fee or get people to sign up for this Uber one thing."
668,It's disingenuous and shady and I deleted the app because of it.
668,I won't be using it any more and will happily give my business to other food delivery apps.
1256,"I was looking through dash pass options, clicked a link I thought would take me to more information but it instead immediately subscribed me, something I was not looking to do."
1256,So I go to try and cancel the subscription.
1256,"As I'm doing so, the app offers me 2 months free trial to dash pass."
1256,"Ok cool, that's fine."
1256,So I follow through with canceling my unintentional subscription.
1256,Open the app a few days later to find the dash pass trial is gone.
1256,"I call and ask about it and am not given any real answer, just told ""well there's nothing we can do about it""."
1256,"So they made an offer, a promise if you will, I accepted, then they decided they just weren't going to follow through with it."
1256,That they could renege on a deal.
1256,Strikes me as shady and unethical at a minimum.
1256,"So despite using this app routinely, you all have now lost a customer."
456,"I hate that I have to talk to someone to cancel my order, by the time someone is able to help me they've already started working on my order and now I have to pay a fee if I want to cancel."
456,Why can't the just use an automated system at least they work faster.
654,"The app is trash , customer service is trash, pricing is misleading ."
654,I ordered groceries because my car is in the shop .
654,"I linked my store reward card items that were showing reduced price and buy one get one free I was charged In full for everything., I pre tipped a percentage of the order I was unable to change the amount based on the items I actually received  and did not approve the tip but was charged."
654,Went to chat support and I don't know it it's an automated system or if the person simply couldn't read.
654,I provided specific examples and chat was ended on me  in the middle of me typing .
654,This company just ripped me off over $50 easily.
654,Way to take advantage of someone when they are down.
654,I will never use uber or uber eats after this.
947,Horrible experience as a 1st time user.
947,"I ordered food, the driver was great, but food was wrong."
947,"I only got the option to rate the driver, not the restaurant."
947,I asked for a refund and their automated system only gave me back $5 out of the $16 worth of missing items.
947,Note my entire bill was $157.
947,"Customer service chat, took over an hour and still didn't fix it."
947,I just gave up.
947,Still no way to review or contact the restaurant that I can find.
947,DoorDash has much better customer service and resolution management.
34,"The reason I called customer care was because the driver left my food out on the sidewalk in front of my apartment building and didn't bother to call or text through the app, just sent a picture of the food on the dirty concrete, and dogs use that area to relieve themselves often."
34,I called customer care and the tier one person (Salim) was rude and made me repeat the grievance over and over rather than just giving me to a supervisor as I had asked.
34,"..My husband had to reiterate the story of the crummy delivery drop off to both Salim and his supervisor before we finally got a refund for the inedible food, but no additional credits for our trouble."
34,"GrubHub's customer care system typically allows customers to review their experiences with operators; however, the supervisor disconnected the call before my husband could do so."
34,Thus we're going more public with how terrible this experience was.
382,Time and time again the delivery drivers ignore the delivery instructions that I am wheelchair bound and need the food delivered to my door.
382,Instead they leave it on the front steps of my 6 story apartment building where it is immediately stolen.
382,They could care less.
632,The service is good for late at night after bars when you can't drive or when you are to busy to get food.
632,In the last year or two the prices have gotten a bit out of hand.
632,It's hard to justify paying $25 for $8 worth of McDonald's.
632,The service is also inconsistent - I have had orders with and estimated delivery time of 30 min take an hour and a half to be delivered (cold food).
632,I've had courier cancel after picking up my food.
632,I've had drivers ignore the delivery instructions and leave food on the sidewalk in front of my apartment building.
632,Other times the food gets delivered quickly.
632,Also there is little recourse if your order is wrong or missing items.
949,I really like this app and I use it almost every day.
949,"But sometimes when I want to know where my food is I have to click the app and check it, I really wish you guys could do the live activity so that I could know when my food would get delivered!!"
949,!
558,"I ordered 81 dollars worth of food from TGI Fridays .When I got the food It didn't come from the person that was in the photo for my delivery driver on the app, didn't bother me much bc I've seen that a few times before but what bothered me was the food did not come in the normal TGI Fridays to-go bag it came In a clean shopping bag the food was tossed around handled roughly.. and was also missing food items, I was scared to eat the food bc the random bag and random guy delivering me the food now was a problem, so I was busy on the job and had to get back to work since I wasn't eating lunch and thought I'd be able to come home after a bad day at work and get my money back from this app that is typically very convenient when im in need of good food delivered and im too busy or lazy too drive myself, in saying that I thought Uber would refund my money instead it's Ben a over a week and I feel like I was robbed I still want to be a customer but I need my hard earned money back bc if I not I'll never use this app again LOL"
941,Pay $120 a year for Uber one????
941,Don't do it.
941,They'll say you gave a pin for your delivery that was never delivered.
941,Gives you zero options to handle the fact that you paid already in your time waiting for the food and hard earned dollars go to nothing.
941,Wait a day to recoup your lost funds because they won't even generate a receipt for you immediately?
941,No.
941,"They'd rather take your money, leave you without food, and leave the driver hoping they get tipped for not delivering your food."
1211,I would do 0 stars if I could.
1211,DoorDash is absolutely the worst app to use for food delivery.
1211,"Customer service is absolutely terrible, they should not even be called customer service because they do absolutely nothing to help!!!"
1211,"I work in a location that doesn't allow cars on the street, so I always make sure to specify which business it is and where it is when ordering food."
1211,"It's not a problem most of the time, and sometimes the dashers will message or call me if they need help."
1211,This time the dasher left my food at another location on the street that was unclear.
1211,I therefore didn't get my food cause I couldn't find it!
1211,I contacted support and they emailed me a pic of my food left outside of a closed building in the rain!
1211,Then said they can't help me the policy won't let them.
1211,Unacceptable.
1211,I will be deleting this app.
1211,Don't waste your hard earned money here.
1211,The worst part is I even left the imbecile a tip!
1272,Wooow I have been a loyal customer for a long time and I use this service daily.
1272,But their customer service has gone downhill recently and I have had it with them.
1272,Imagine spending $70+ of your hard earned money on an order to find feathers in your food!!!
1272,"I threw it all away and asked for compensation since the food was not edible, I was bounced around different sketchy teams of customer support that flat out told me due to the history of your account we cannot compensate you."
1272,"Keep in mind for the past 100+ orders i have not requested any compensation to make matters worse everytime i try to finish writing this review it starts deleting itself, Worst customer service ever save your money as they will steal it and go with any other app that offers similar services."
1272,This one is not worth it
18,Placed my order and I could see tracking of driver picking up food.
18,Then all of a sudden the driver is switched to a different person who then drives to the same location to pick up my food.
18,"After a confirmation of my food being picked up and the driver coming all the way to my hotel parking lot, calls me to question if I picked up my food already."
18,I have been waiting over an hour (order was delayed due to the driver switch) just to then be accused that I picked up my own food?!
18,"So after waiting all that time, and then driving to my location to finally inform me my order was ""lost."""
18,"I then get in touch with customer support who informs me it will take up to 5 days to be refunded and that my order could not be created as the place wouldn't be able to make it  in time so then I had to figure out a different delivery as I was not going to risk my food being ""lost"" again through this terrible service."
18,Never using Grubhub again.
18,Worst first experience.
254,Drivers picking up multiple orders last few times has resulted in stone cold food.
254,I literally saw the guy sit in a parking lot away from my restaurant after picking up my order waiting on another order.
254,He could have delivered the food in the the time he sat there.
254,Food arrives stone cold.
254,"$30 worth of cold, gross, soggy food."
254,Grubhub offered this Grubhub plus member $5 to make up for it.
254,Uber eats from now on.
254,Deleting app
901,Wish I could attach pictures to reviews...one of your employees delivered my pizza by eating three slices and drinking my drink then she proceeded to tell me my order has arrived and throws it under her Prius in my condo parking lot and runs over the box with what's left inside leaving me to clean up splatter pizza in front of my place.
901,Customer service was no help.
901,Had to take pictures and go through a forum and still haven't gotten my money back for that delivery.
901,This Saudi company doesn't care who they hire they will literally hire anyone and I doubt she got fired.
1014,this app is crazy with the taxing.
1014,for example it says my total is around 15$ and then when I pay it's like 23$ dollars.
1014,it also charges a delivery fee when I pay monthly for better deals.
1014,makes no sense.
1014,not to mention the fact that you can deliver from some places but then when you try to pick up from that place it isn't available ( btw picking up is cheaper so ofc they do that 🙄) but it makes no sense that a driver can pick it up but you can't.
1014,also I have ordered from a place only to have the driver text me and say it was closed.
1014,"as well as have a driver pick up my food and never show up, he stayed in a parking lot I could see it on the maps."
1014,plus they ALWAYS forget items.
1014,"recently I ordered subway and got a sandwich drink and cookie, bro forgot the cookie and drink … that's like the whole order smh 🤦🏻‍♀️"
1017,"I don't know how Postmates stays in business, never had experiences so bad as using this app."
1017,"Not only did the delivery person deliver to the wrong address, they left the food outside during heat wave by the parking lot next to the call box and made no attempt to call me."
1017,They sent a picture of the food at the wrong call box and by the time my partner and I rushed down 3 floors to get outside I'm 87 degree heat our food was already gone.
1017,Trash company.
1017,I reach out to the customer service company to tell them of the situation and they were like sorry there's nothing we can do.
1017,You just gotta eat the cost.
1017,"They ""tried to contact you"" like I have call logs, no one called."
1017,No reimbursement.
1017,"Use Grubhub, this company is trash."
1273,Every single time I order anything through this app there is an issue or inconvenience.
1273,The ONLY reason I'm still using this app is because my money is tied up in credits that has to be used before I am able to delete this entire app.
1273,These drivers are poor sorry excuse for working citizens.
1273,They are very lazy and most are too illiterate to follow simple directions such as HAND IT TO ME!
1273,Dashers will pick up the call but not the order.
1273,I've had dashers literally sitting in the parking lot high off drugs while I'm waiting on my order to be delivered.
1273,Called the merchant only for them to say they have completed my order 45 minutes ago.
1273,Gets up and go to the place and the dasher is over dosing in the parking lot from some type of drug with my food in the car.
1273,These people hire anybody but refused to hire me.
1273,Tuh!
51,"Any app that forces you to go through their crazy menu drilldown for support instead of just having a support@ email is super shady...After my order was completely messed up, I went through GrubHub's predetermined flow in their app and I got a 1 cent refund."
51,#1 that is a total bull refund amount.
51,Hoping your customers won't notice?
51,#2 it took me way too long to even find out where I could talk to a real human.
51,Hoping that a hard-to-find option of real support means GrubHub is hoping that people will just give up when they need help instead of fixing their crappy policies.
51,#3 the human I actually chatted with was incredibly helpful and solved my issue in less than a minute.
51,They asked for me to rate them and I gladly wanted to rate them well.
51,"The option came up as ""Good 👍"" or ""Bad 👎"" but this app is so bad I couldn't even click the button to rate them!..The only reason I'm even leaving this review is that there are ZERO options to report a bug directly to grubhub."
51,Such a waste of time.
51,..My orders are constantly messed up and there is no recourse.
51,I'm just going to call restaurants directly from now on.
531,Uber will actively try and bully you into not complaining if an order goes wrong.
531,I've had a terrible week with Uber having messed up items or finding multiple hairs in my food and customer support emailed sayin I might get banned from customer support claims???
531,"First, why would I ever use this service again if that's your attitude?"
531,"Secondly, maybe do anything to actually improve the gig economy work flow and you'd have less mess ups."
531,"Third, Uber takes at least twice the amount for services than what the driver makes in a delivery fee."
531,"The driver also has to maintain the vehicle with gas, etc."
531,Uber doesn't feel like they deserve to be real humans so they give their drivers 0 worker rights.
531,Uber is now back door punishing me for my support claims by making me wait hours for my food with no ability to cancel.
531,Uber your trash and you're never getting any of my money again...Terrible app!!!
531,They continually adjust the estimated delivery time so they're not wrong.
531,Paid for fast delivery and it still took a long long time for the food to get here.
538,I have had several interactions with the customer service department at Uber eats.
538,They refuse to work with their customers when the customer and the delivery driver both acknowledge that the problem was originated on the restaurant's end of the order.
538,"I have now been denied a refund on 2 separate occasions when a restaurant did not contact me when they were out of an item on my order (which the Uber eats guidelines specify they should do) and when I chose to cancel the order instead of accept it with an unwanted substitute, I am still charged!"
538,"..Not only am I irritated and frustrated by the lack of regard of company policy by its customer service department, I cannot even get a person on the phone to speak to!"
538,All of the customer service interactions are done by a chat feature on the app.
538,"I don't want to chat with a computer , I want to speak to a real human!..Uber eats, you have lost a long time customer today!"
538,Shame on you for not hearing out the CRAP your customers are tolerating from some of your restaurant partners!
646,$40 of my $78 food order was missing.
646,"After reporting the issue on the app, The uber eats App ""auto credits"" me $5 and says sorry cant help you anymore."
646,"Five dollars is not nearly close to equaling the $40 so I tried to get further assistance on the order, since the app clearly got it wrong."
646,Uber eats App blocks every attempt to resolve this issue on my end.
646,Cant even get in touch with a real human to speak with or even an email or chat to resolve this issue.
646,And whats worse….
646,"They didn't even return the $5 to my card, they give me a five dollar ""store credit"" on an app I'm never gonna use again..Awful when things go wrong with your order on this app.Good luck.Good buy uber eats delivery for me!"
1035,I order food at 1:07 pm.
1035,It said it would be here by 1:20.
1035,(Starbucks is extremely close to my location).
1035,"It is now 1:36, my order is ready waiting at Starbucks and there is still not a delivery person assigned to my order."
1035,"I contacted support and it was not helpful at all, they aren't real humans it's literally just computers."
1035,It now says my order will be delivered by 2:10 latest because it hasn't connected me to a driver.
1035,I've tried contacting support and they r the most unhelpful thing ever.
1035,Bye.
757,Nice app they have your favorite restaurants the only problem for me tho is that your delivery person should focus on one order not have multiple orders from lots of people like I'm still waiting on my delivery and I have an appointment at 11am and it's 10:43am and I'm waiting on my meal but the delivery person is delivering someone elses food you should change that and make them do just one delivery once done they do another one pls
754,I ordered a big order .
754,"The driver was in the same position for over 2 hours to then I found out that the order had never been picked up, the  driver never answered after I contacted  and the merchant said that the order had been picked up, I contacted Postmates and all they did was  cancel the order and gave me a $10 credit!"
754,Where is the customer service to this?
754,Why am I waiting and spending a lot of money on this app for service that is not noticeable???
754,Definitely not happy about this and there should be a lot more done to customers for these types of situations.
754,I will contact the better business bureau immediately to rectify this!!!
754,!
777,"I've used many delivery services, but Uber Eats is the worst."
777,It's almost impossible to get a refund for the difference of an incomplete order that the restaurant messed up; then they try to make you feel as if you're getting over on them.
777,I had to file complaints with the Better Business Bureau and email randomly executives just for a partial refund on an order.
777,There's been times when food arrived and items were missing and I didn't report it because I didn't feel like arguing with customers service.
777,"Once a month, I am forced to deal with Uber Eats or risk losing my monthly Uber credit from American Express."
1098,Tried to Order pizza.
1098,The app became stuck on send for over 30 minutes.
1098,We had no choice but to cancel.
1098,We then called support and we're RUDELY hung up on.
1098,Wouldn't even offer to give us food or credit for the money we paid.
1098,We want our money refunded.
1098,It's not our fault your app malfunctioned.
1098,We will be reporting you to the better business bureau.
237,First order the delivery driver disappeared off the face of the earth.
237,Second order gets cancelled because of a menu issue.
237,..Seamless and Grubhub.
237,If your drivers can not commit to a delivery and your vendors can not commit to a menu or product then you literally have nothing here.
237,Your entire business model is falling apart and will soon fail if you don't tighten up the ship and hold people accountable.
237,I will never use you again.
237,Terrible.
287,I had a issue before with a card authorization hold but after 24 hours I was able to order my item.
598,The restaurant doesn't start making your food until a driver confirms the order.
598,"But if the driver cancels, your food can sit for a very long time before another driver confirms it."
598,"That being said, my food arrived 30 minutes later than expected, and it was cold."
598,"To top it off, the new driver completely ignored instructions."
598,"..This morning, I also found out they charge an authorization hold."
598,"If I didn't have a little extra money in my account, I could have been charged an overdraft fee because I'm struggling financially right now."
598,"The only reason why I ordered in the first place was because I had $30 off and figured that's how I'd feed myself this week, but I found out it was for delivery only."
598,The delivery fees and additional fees are more expensive than the other popular food delivery apps.
598,And their tipping range is so weird (like 9% or 11%).
871,"Deleting the app after this review, but i have been charged for orders 3 times now that were cancelled by the merchant."
871,Customer service never addresses the problem they offer credits for the app or tell you to talk to your bank about it.
871,Even if your order is cancelled by the app or merchant as soon as you place it there is still a 3-10 day authorization hold on the money that twice now has ended up sticking.
871,"Ive had to go through my bank twice now for refunds because uber wouldnt solve the problem, overall very bad business."
36,The map updates very slowly when you are viewing the progress of the driver.
36,"I was on the phone with one and trying to direct him, and the map was well behind his actual location...Grubhub also fails to create driver profiles that are simple to view and rate like Uber does."
36,"With Uber, you can click on the driver profile and view comments, ratings, specific qualities, and other information."
36,"Once the order is completed, Uber has you rate right away to encourage a response...On Grubhub there is no such thing."
36,"With Grubhub you have to go out of your way to do a rating for a driver, so the only people who will likely be doing that are ones who have a negative rating to give."
36,"I found this out trying to rate my driver for going above and beyond, which would have been easy to do with Uber but not with Grubhub."
36,"You cannot clarify any details with your order after the fact or anything else like you can with Uber...The search option is clearly incomplete based on the results received depending on how you choose to sort them...Other than that, the food is there, and it works the same as any other app."
68,"I used the app to arrange for a Thanksgiving dinner to be delivered to my mom and her neighbor, and used PayPal for the $77 total."
68,"Two days before thanksgiving, I get a call that a) the order has been canceled, b) I will have to wait for at least a week to get my money back, and c) I can reorder if needed."
68,"..So, I tried again, and the order was immediately cancelled a second time BUT they took the $77 out of my PayPal again."
68,That's $154 tied up for over a week!
68,Not to mention having to explain to my mom that her happily anticipated Thanksgiving dinner won't be coming.
68,"..I'm absolutely fuming, and if I could give them a negative rating on the app, I would."
68,"As soon as I get EVERYTHING, every penny, back, I'm deleting this app."
1251,I ordered from DoorDash and when the driver called me to say that he couldn't find my place I was giving him directions on how to get to my place he got all flustered and told me I don't know man I don't know I just don't know where I'm going I'm going in circles and I said well maybe you should have a job like this if you don't know directions then he's like well where do I go and I go to where are you at cause I don't know man I don't know there's no street signs there's street signs all over.
1251,So if you ever get Andrew as your door dasher make sure to cancel that order and order from someone else.
1251,Not only did I not get my food but when I went to re-order he had taken so long that the place that I ordered from was closed.
1251,Terrible terrible terrible if I could do a negative rating I would do a -75 Andrew is a terrible employee
186,It's disappointing to see that this app doesn't give their customers a discount on their next order when a restaurant cancel's your order after waiting a significant amount of time.
186,It's best to just order from restaurants directly as they will say if they deliver to your address since most of the times they don't update their information on this application as to what their limits are with delivery.
242,My bank account was hacked through Grubhub and they cleared out significant amounts of money from my bank all linked to Grubhub.
242,"They placed very high dollar fraudulent orders out of state and Grubhub doesn't even give you, the driver or the help chat agent the ability to cancel a live order or a number to talk to for direct help."
242,3-5 business days to get a refund.
242,I strongly urge you to NEVER download this app.I had to google Grubhub customer service number to even find any help.
923,Paying Uber One member and lately the delivery experience has been horrible.
923,"Always delays, and somehow drivers end up on the complete opposite side of town with my order after picking it up."
923,"How is that a ""stop along the way""?"
923,It's entirely out of the way.
923,I write this as yet another order was delayed a significant amount of time.
923,"Driver picked up food finally and they added another stop, delaying it even more!"
923,If your customer's order was already delayed it's totally unacceptable to be adding stops.
144,"Between the inflated prices, the $20 minimum order fee and the subscription, it's an unreasonable situation for a person looking to order one meal a few times a month."
144,"I was about to order two meals the other day just to get my order approved, but the cost was over $30 all-in, which is SO much more than I wanted to spend."
144,"Just by ordering that much food from the local sandwich shop, I could save $10."
647,There's too many times when restaurants and carriers aren't held accountable for forgotten items.
647,Getting reimbursed a portion of the inflated prices doesn't seem fair...There's needs to be a process for editing an order if both the carrier and the customer are in communication and agree on the change.
647,My wife ordered food from Safeway and the base of the meal was hamburger meat but they were out of the brand she selected and the carrier wanted to help but wasn't allowed to change the item.
647,"We ended up not having the vote item for our dinner and had to change our plans to go to the store, which clearly defeats the purpose of the order in the first place."
1187,I always use Ubereats but the app was glitchy so I resorted to this and regret it.
1187,In 2 nights I've amassed a credit of about $80 due to their poor services.
1187,"First night food came cold, guac was already brown and half the ingredients missing."
1187,"Normally Uber would call to advise of missing ingredients, do you still want, etc."
1187,"Then to go on and use the $40 credit tonight ordered from another restaurant, they called to offer a substitution."
1187,"Then the delivery person cancelled my order, which mind you, due to their inflated prices came out to double then what it would have been on Uber, due to him waiting on line to long, but he told customer service they weren't allowing substitutions."
1187,"He probably was able to walk off with my order for free which hey maybe he needed it, but now I have another $35 credit added to my total."
1187,Again these weren't huge orders!
1187,"Worst app, worst customer service, once I can finally use my useless credit I'm deleting the app for good."
1187,Don't bother use Ubereats.
1343,Soo I love the convenience of DoorDash but man.. do they have some problems.
1343,"The app it's self is seamless and well built, but everything else is awful."
1343,"From the dashers themselves, the inflated priced on items (even if you purchase their ‘dash pass'), the inaccurate map- to them not holding their Dasher's accountable for marking orders ""waiting for order"" where then half way across the city or doing multiple deliveries when they've marked as your ordering being close by."
1343,It's infuriating.
1343,"Orders always show up cold, and half heartedly delivered."
1343,It's difficult to support a business that doesn't hold their employees accountable.
1343,I'll enjoy UberEats for this reason and use DoorDash when I have too.
11,I had 2 experiences where the driver couldn't find my house.
11,Poor directions from Grubhub.
11,"I live on a busy street, right across from a high school, with a unique tower above the garage and the drivers still couldn't find it!"
11,I even had one delivery person leave my order at the wrong house and do nothing.
11,Sometimes I don't have a car and so ordering my food to be delivered is the only way I can get it.
11,I have never had this problem with Doordash or Instacart.
11,I only started with Grubhub because of a promotion from my work.
11,"I decided to cancel my $10 a month membership, after one of the drivers, who drove past my house twice, even with me telling him the directions very politely at the same time, threaten to drive off with my order and not deliver it."
11,He then refused to drive into my driveway and had me run out to his truck to grab it.
11,"Once I did, I said ""Thank you!"""
11,And he said said uh-huh and drove off.
11,"I get it, he took longer to find my house, but I did tip 20%."
11,I should not have been treated like that.
11,"I do work customer service and I do know how hard it can be, but in this case, how I was treated, was unacceptable."
340,I would use the service more if it was just a bit less expensive.
340,Kinda seems like a high school math - maximizing profit problem …you missed the vertex 🤷🏻‍♂️
522,"I've always enjoyed using Uber Eats, though today I ordered like a $35 dollar order."
522,"I'm in high school, have no job (I'm underage) and I just wanted lunch."
522,"When I ordered, I didn't think about tip."
522,"Though I like to tip low, then go back and change it afterwards depending on their service."
522,"I tipped a dollar today planning to tip more after I got my food, but never received my order!"
522,"I was there when it said delivered in the place I asked her to take the food, and she's weirdly enough a diamond member with like a 99% good rating."
522,"Though today, I believe she took my food or threw it away or something due to low tip."
522,"I called her 3 times, I was forwarded to voicemail after a few rings each time."
522,I reached out to customer service with 3 different people and all of them said my account wasn't eligible due to already receiving a refund on a totally different order like 6 months ago?
522,"After a while, I got frustrated and stopped even wanting a refund."
522,"I asked them if i could at least get in touch with my delivery person and see what they did with my food, though she disconnected."
522,Horrible customer service.
430,It's ok but they have drivers that deliver to complete opposite locations of where you are pretty frequently so your food is cold and will need some microwaving.
430,On average add 20-30 minutes on to the original estimate.
430,They charge a lot for service fees and delivery fees to get cold food delivered.
1234,"The only problem with doordash is sometime they will have stores showing it's available but they might be closed, then if your order it canceled you can get credit but if you get a refund back to your card it's gonna take a whole week and most time you can't pick if you want credit or your money back, and some of the dashers will steal your food so be careful and use Uber eats it's the complete opposite of doordash."
1234,If your order get cancale your get your money back right then and there you don't have to wait and they show you that the store is open or close and the right days and time they open
707,I have ordered using uber eats multiple times and time after time my orders arrive wrong.
707,They do not hold the restaurants or drivers accountable at all.
707,There are no places for notes and they decide to not refund your money if you've had refunds in the past.
707,It is not our fault that they don't have any quality control measures within the system they are creating.
707,I basically paid $50 for two child subs (literally) and two drinks I did not order.
707,"After reviewing they pretty much said ""sorry for this but no refund."""
707,Basically by using this app you are prepaying for a good/service you may or may not receive.
707,It's not worth it for all the delivery fees and up charges.
886,"WAY overpriced, consistently takes over 1.5 hours for service, always changing drivers, constantly forgetting food and part of the order (which is insane for the prices you have to pay), and most importantly there is horrible communication with the app to handle the problems that happen constantly...They need to find a better way to get drivers places faster and ensure quality control of the orders if they are going to charge such insane prices."
886,It's not even slightly worth it for customers.
1325,I was a regular and multiple times a day user and it just happens too often that the wrong food shows up and they don't do anything but refund you for the missing item and that doesn't really help you when you were counting on the meal and somebody is sitting there without their food.
1325,If these services can't put some short quality control in place to make sure that you actually get the food you order then it's never gonna work long-term I'm done.
32,"I received a grubhub gift card and tried using it, my order was over the amount of the gift card so i added my debit card and paid the remaining balance with no problem."
32,"my order went through and immediately got cancelled, apparently it ""didn't get processed""."
32,"customer service told me they'd refund me within 48 hours and here we are, 48 hours later with no refund."
32,"to make matters more frustrating, now anytime i try to order something it tells me to enter my credit card, venmo, or apple pay."
32,i've connected my venmo and my apple pay and neither of them will work as payment.
32,i've tried my credit card and debit card and it keeps telling me to enter the correct card number despite me doing so atleast 8 different times.
32,i'm getting fed up to the point of just deleting the app and telling everyone i know to NEVER use grubhub ever.
32,Uber eats is way better and their fees are cheaper anyways.
67,"Be very careful when you use this platform, check your bank account for unauthorized transactions from this company."
67,"I'm aware as the last month I've had 3 different unauthorized uses of my debit card from this company, 2 in Chicago and 1 in California, this is not a safe place to order food,.if you're going to use your debit/credit card one way or another this company do not protect your financial information and let others use your cards, it can be someone working for them or their poor security system that allows hackers to get your card information..this is not a safe place to order food online anymore as your card most likely will be used for someone else..CHECK YOUR BANK ACCOUNT"
544,"Supposedly, they allow you to order in advance for up to a week."
544,"However, without notice, they canceled ALL of my upcoming orders, and pretended that something was wrong with my debit card, totally freaking me out."
544,"However, what had actually happened was they didn't like it that I ordered the exact same meal for every day, so they just decided to cancel them."
544,I tried a different restaurant and they also pretended like something was wrong with my debit card.
544,"When in reality, my debit card has now apparently been BANNED from UberEats, all because they don't approve of me ordering the exact same meal every day."
544,"I immediately went to DoorDash, and was able to place an order, no problem."
544,"In other words, literally NOTHING is wrong with my card."
544,I have since made other purchases elsewhere as well without problems.
544,"Again, NOTHING is wrong with my card."
544,"Needless to say, I have since deleted the UberEats app."
544,"Also, since I could never get a fully straight answer, the restaurant in question is called El Castillo."
544,I am now COMPLETELY DONE with them as well.
544,That is all.
868,"I would've love to give this application a five star rating however when it came time to pay I would not take my cash app card ,I seem to run into this problem also with Uber rides and all that the payment part is a little complicated and not so user-friendly.I end up having to put the funds into Apple Pay,Which makes no sense because it should be able to take my Cash App debit card."
1008,"I downloaded this app signed up put credit card, debit card, Apple Pay and $130 Uber cash on my account."
1008,Now when I try to use my Uber cash even with my card there is an error.
1008,I let Postmates know this in the beginning of October and they have done nothing but repeatedly sent me the same message without reading what the actual complaint was which is they have $110 of mine that I cannot spend.
1008,"I live in California (expensive), I'm  pregnant with an entire family and $110 is a lot of money which I was trying to feed my family with and Postmates will not give it back nor fix the app."
1008,We are in a recession and this company will not even respond to me anymore when I ask them for legal information so I can't even attempt to get my money back.
1008,"Now I will be taking this to social media, the actual media and everywhere else until I get my money back or they fix the app."
1008,This is unacceptable and that is the last of my money since I have been on leave for disability and I want it back or I wanna be able to provide food for my family.
1032,This is the biggest waste of space ever on earth its there for no reason bc you cant even use it they jus dont wanna make money thats why this app is way less known then door dash or uber bc nobody can even use it if they want terrible and disgusting its here jus for people to download so they can make money from the actual download its self they r not a real business like uber or door dash this is no more then an indian scam calling website and they want ur debit card jus like a scammer would im no detective but if i had to say this app and its owners are doing something shady 1000% dont trust them
1193,I got the free 1 week free dash pass and made sure to cancel it AS SOON as I got it because I didn't want any funny business.
1193,And alas!
1193,There was funny business.
1193,My dashpass expires I got the notification.
1193,"I'm like ok cool whatever, a few seconds go by and my phone dings, boom I just charged for dash pass."
1193,"So I double, no I TRIPLE check I had it cancelled."
1193,It wasn't.
1193,I cancel it again leaving it at I just forgot to cancel the subscription.
1193,10 bucks wasn't that bad so I didn't care.
1193,"Another month, my phone dings saying I GOT ANOTHER MONTH of dashpass for 10 dollars."
1193,"Ok so at this point I'm mad, so I go into my bank app and pay 30 dollars to them to stop ANY subscription service from DoorDash to DECLINE."
1193,I made a special thing about you guys.
1193,Then another month goes by AND THERE IT IS WOW so I just cancel the debit card.
1193,I'm still waiting for my debit card so I used Apple Pay ONCE on DoorDash to get a patty melt.
1193,How naive I was I didn't even give them my debit card information AND THEY CHARGED ME 10 DOLLARS AGAIN for dashpass.
1193,GG's doordash.
1193,GG's
27,Tried it out for the first time using a gift card.
27,Ordered from a place we typically love.
27,It was very easy.
27,Driver was awesome we tipped well.
27,"However, GrubHub managed a huge markup on everything in addition to multiple fees etc."
27,"After everything, it almost doubled the price of our normal order."
27,We would be crazy to use GrubHub unless it's an emergency.
27,"..Also, the app suggested to us to add-on drinks at 7-11 on the way."
27,I tried to add drinks onto the order but it seemed to be missing beer from the app.
27,Just suggested pop and energy drinks.
27,No thank you.
27,..I'll just be picking up myself in the future.
27,Maybe I will try that next time… assuming there aren't tons of fees/markup.
27,I didn't know it was an option but I just Googled it and found this is offered.
27,"Honestly, would rather call the restaurant and order direct to support their business."
105,I tried to use my corporate gift card along with using my own Apple Pay card for the additional charges (over the amount of the gift card).
105,"However, I received an error that multiple payment types wasn't allowed."
105,I was trying to spend an additional 1.5 the amount of the gift card.
105,Is this intentional or a possible bug?
105,"Otherwise, the App's UI is very aesthetic pleasing!"
116,"I had a terrible experience with the app after using a gift card, the restaurant left out an entree requiring me to place another order for that standalone item."
116,"The refund from the first order for the missing item was only $25, however to place the order alone cost me over $40."
116,Had to do it to feed my guests.
116,"..Customer service informed me they would refund the difference, that never happened, put in another ticket and the next customer service rep blew me off."
116,..Delete the Grubhub app and work directly with restaurants.
150,Tried to apply a gift card that i was given but no option to apply so i thought it would apply automatically at check out.
150,"The gift card did not apply and when i contacted customer service i was offered no help, nothing to assure me this wouldn't happen again."
150,"Just that they didn't have ""access to change it."""
150,"I won't be using this app again based off this, lost a potential customer and they can keep the gift card."
155,"I've been ordering from grubhub for a very long time I'm sorry I had to give them a 1 star, put I've bought an gift card for a family member but he didn't want it so I redeemed it ."
155,"I tried to order food with it and it keeps saying my order cannot be processed so I , then tried to update my add that didn't work either."
155,"So I said ok it doesn't matter I won't use the gift card not I cannot order using my card, Apple Pay, or PayPal."
155,Atp I'm starting to get angry ..
155,I might delete my grubhub if they don't solve this issue.
176,"I received a gift card to use and loaded it to my account, when I tried to use the credit said it wasn't able to process my order."
176,I tried multiple times over multiple days.
176,"I then tried with my credit card and wouldn't you know it, it worked...I contacted customer service and it's been a week and a half of reviewing my account and it's still under review."
176,If you're going to use this service do not use gift cards.
215,Couldn't figure out how to apply gift card.
215,Committed to pay out of pocket and finally found the option during review.
215,Not intuitive.
215,"HIGHLY RECOMMEND you add a note to payment screen that says, ""Have a gift card?"
215,"You can apply it at the final review/ next screen."""
247,I've been trying to get a gift card issue resolved for over a month.
247,"Every time I follow up in chat, they say ""we will follow up in 48 hours"" which of course never happens."
247,"So my account has been under review for a month and while they review, i can't use my gift card."
247,Smh!
247,They just give you the runaround without really trying to resolve the issue.
247,Never again!
274,Very frustrating to use and it makes you dive in to multiple screens in order for it to use the gift card I already have added in my account.
274,..The layout of the food/menu items is very hard to navigate.
274,"..At the end of the day it gets the job done, but I will not being buying Grubhub gift cards for myself or friends."
292,Never been a fan of these crappy food delivery apps but I had a gift card so of course tried again.
292,"Not surprisingly, the driver picked up my food and then drove around for 45 minutes, presumably going to drop other people's food off."
292,The food came cold and late.
292,Most definitely would have just picked it up myself if I knew it was going to be such a circus.
375,Grubhub has cancelled the last 7 orders I've made!!
375,"I have been gifted food gift cards to help my family as I recover from a tragic accident, and they must not service the area."
375,"Once it was an hour wait, and they cancelled it an hour after order."
375,Do not buy gift cards or order through grubhub if you are located in the north west Minneapolis suburb.
411,Work gave me a $25 gift card.
411,Most of the restaurants I would pick still had $12 -$18 MORE to pay even after the $25.
411,"Who knew getting pho, 2 spring rolls, and a tea delivered to your house cost over $40."
411,"..I finally found a restaurant that only had $7 in excess of $25 for my pho, spring rolls, and tea."
411,Too bad I've already lost my sanity due to how expensive this country is.
489,I feel awful for any restaurant trying to work with Grubhub.
489,Constant delivery issues and only using because we received a gift card.
489,And it was extremely confusing and time consuming to use gift card.
489,What does it matter….Apple won't post this anyways ;)
496,"The menus aren't full or represent what all is at the stores..Often sizes are missing, like only being able to choose small drinks..The drivers are rude and unhelpful."
496,".I have had an incredibly difficult time using this app, if I'm ever given a GrubHub gift card again I'll be regifting it."
501,I used Uber Eats for the first time a month ago.
501,"When I received my food, it had multiple pieces of hair in it."
501,After contacting Uber eats immediately- with proof of calls and emails they asked me to replace the order and would remove the charges.
501,After countless times they did not remove both charges or fees totaling of over $100 because I now had to place the order twice.
501,Over 5-7 calls with customer service the issue was never resolved and the service reps repeat themselves countless times over and over to apologize but have zero idea how to communicate or fix the issue.
501,I asked for a supervisor and she said they'd contact me in a few business days and did not.
501,After going to an event and speaking to a representative they offered me a $30 gift card which I tried to use tonight.
501,After adding it to my account and placing the order the app said not available.
501,"Again, I called customer service and she asked me to delete the app and redownload it."
501,Now the promo is gone if my $30 and over 30 minutes on the phone she asks me to wait 1-3 hours to figure out the issue.
501,So again you have taken my money with no service and terrible customer service.
501,Now the restaurant is closed and I have no gift card.
501,I would not recommend this company to any individual and their customer service reps need more training assist customers oppose to continuously apologizing.
501,I have had two horrible experiences and this company in my eyes just takes your money.
553,"I had never needed to use uber for any reason, however my 3 year old is in the hospital diagnosised with cancer and so a friend gifted us an Uber gift card to have food delivered to.The hospital."
553,"It took three times for me to be able to use my gift card, the first two times I tried to order breakfast at dunkin, and then again tried to order lunch at Bolay and it kept telling me to remove the promotion from the order."
553,The promotion it was talking about was because I just signed up and gave me free deliveries for a month.
553,There was no option to remove this anywhere...Finally the restaurant I chose to use this time had an option to have it delivered directly to me so I paid my delivery fee and  then it allowed me to use a gift card and place my order.
553,"I honestly was so frustrated with this app and the whole situation not being able to remove the promotion uber gave me, That I didn't even add it to my order."
553,I promise I don't think I will ever use Uber eats again besides the fact that I had the gift card today.
642,My bestie is sick so I wanted to get her dinner taken care of for herself and her two kids.
642,I didn't have any money left in the bank but I had cash.
642,So I bought a Uber Eats gift card.
642,"When I applied it, it turned into Uber Cash."
642,When I tried to pay for order it kept coming up with an error message.
642,"After getting tech help, I was told I had to have a secondary form of payment on file to even use the Uber Cash."
642,"Finally after almost an hour of trying to get this figured out, the payment went through after adding a bank card."
642,Uber Eats should allow you to use your Uber Cash without needing a bank card on file.
642,So dumb.
642,"After this Uber cash is used up, I will be deleting account and not recommending this service to my friends and family."
741,"I have an Uber pass and I get charged for delivery every time, without fail."
741,Why?
741,Probably because I'm paying with gift card credits rather than me credit card.
741,Does this matter to DoorDash?
741,Nope.
741,"When an issue happens, Uber HATES you talking to humans because it costs them money."
741,So what do they do?
741,They make it literally impossible to talk to someone unless there's an emergency or a safety issue.
741,I was mistakenly charged the delivery fee AND not given my 5% credit.
741,I had to use an old order to get the chat window to appear.
741,"On top of that, they definitely have higher prices and charge more fees than DoorDash."
741,Once my credits are all used I'm done using these guys.
940,This was my second attempt at ever using Uber eats because someone gave us a gift card.
940,App would not allow me to enter my gift card.
940,I ordered using my own payment.
940,"30 minutes later, the order was canceled without ever notifying me."
940,They say the merchant canceled it.
940,The merchant disputes this.
940,The chat told me that they declined to help me do the prior number of disputes.
940,"However, I have only ever use the app one time before 3 years ago and it went through without incident."
963,I got a $50 gift card from a family friend after my son was born.
963,My wife and I tried to redeem it and order a meal to be delivered so we could focus on taking care of our son.
963,"I have not tried to place the order 10+ times in the span of an hour, and the order has not gone through once."
963,I have tried to reach out to customer service with no response.
963,"Instead of being a convenience, Uber eats has made our already stressful life more stressful."
963,Awful experience all around.
1122,"I placed an order, two drivers bailed out on the order due to having to wait an extra ten minutes."
1122,Mind you we tip a ridiculous amount both being in the service industry.
1122,"So, someone picks up the order drops it off and runs away."
1122,100% incorrect order.
1122,Missing all four drinks/shakes and I don't know the 2nd bag of the order.
1122,100% under the wrong name… my name brings with and E not and A.
1122,Call customer service and told 100% will go back to the card….
1122,It didn't.
1122,So I contact them and of course there is NOTHING THEY CAN DO.
1122,"This man I spoke to via text convo, told me to calm down said I was too excited and maybe I had personal problems to be upset that I was lied to again."
1122,I have loads of screenshots where I was Insulted and pretty much called a p.o.s.
1122,By someone who refused to apply the credit to my card and not an app credit.
1122,I was then promised 30+ dollars in a gift card multiple times and got a wait for it 5.00 credit… when asking to speak with someone higher up or idk maybe over the phone I was told I was old and to get with the times.
1122,No on talks on the phone anymore.
1122,I am sure the BBB would LOVE to know they are lying about their return policy and method of payment.
1122,Customer service is disgusting and a total waste of time.
1122,Just don't use the app.
1122,Just drive to the place.
1122,Give the money to the restaurant directly.
1122,Crappy drivers are one thing.
1122,Bad customer service is a company approved problem.
1134,I've never been more disappointed with a major companies customer service.
1134,This app is horrible.
1134,I forgot to cancel my dash pass and they attempted to take 10 dollars from me for it.
1134,Lucky there was nothing in the bank account they tried to take it from.
1134,The only reason it wasn't canceled prior is because I would have lost my free trail to the dash pass.
1134,The company is deliberately trying to take advantage of people that forget to cancel.
1134,"After they tried to steal 10 dollars from me, for a service I had no intentions of renewing or spending money on, there was no option to cancel the dash pass."
1134,I contacted support and they were so pathetically worthless.
1134,I wouldn't have to be worried about being charged but I received an email today saying they tried to steal my money again!
1134,I'd already deleted the account too and it forfeited the change I had left over from a gift card.
1134,That's how badly I just wanted to be done with them.
1134,They're still trying to steal my money!
1134,They're criminals!
1134,I even replied to the initial email they sent me about the failed payment.
1134,"I replied to cancel it, it said in the email, I could reply there."
1134,Such a worthless support system!
1134,I will never be using their service again and I would encourage people to use another option.
1189,Had multiple problems with the app.
1189,Tried multiple cards and even bought a gift card to try to place an order and received the same error notification.
1189,"Spent over an hour with them on support, which turned out to be the biggest waste of time I could spend because they could only help to the point of ""have you tried logging out and logging back in?"""
1189,Level of service.
1189,When I accepted that could do anything for me after about an hour of being transferred and put on hold.
1189,I asked if I could get a refund on the gift card that I bought to try to place the order.
1189,"Their response ""we don't do refunds on gift cards"" then proceed to say the reason it wouldn't go through was that the card was being declined, even though I used the same card to buy the gift card."
1189,So they will take your money but have trouble providing the service they offer.
1189,"Go with Uber eats or one of the others, too many good options to put up with this."
630,Spoke to an agent about a reorder for an order that was dropped off that the wrong house in the wrong neighborhood.
630,All I asked was for a reorder.
630,The agent gave me a partial refund after a 5 minute hold.
630,I asked how much the refund before and did not answer question.
630,Sent back a message saying that I could re order again online.
630,I assume that is an automatic email response they had.
630,I asked to speak to a supervisor after multiple times asking how much the refund was for and another agent entered the chat and said that a supervisor wouldn't be available for 2 hours.
630,Unprofessional behavior and unacceptable.
630,I would have understood if my initial question was answered but the agent was reluctant to even help.
630,"Never using again, already not using Uber due to a poor customer service experience there as well."
1020,Spoke to an agent about a reorder for an order that was dropped off that the wrong house in the wrong neighborhood.
1020,All I asked was for a reorder.
1020,The agent gave me a partial refund after a 5 minute hold.
1020,I asked how much the refund before and did not answer question.
1020,Sent back a message saying that I could re order again online.
1020,I assume that is an automatic email response they had.
1020,I asked to speak to a supervisor after multiple times asking how much the refund was for and another agent entered the chat and said that a supervisor wouldn't be available for 2 hours.
1020,Unprofessional behavior and unacceptable.
1020,I would have understood if my initial question was answered but the agent was reluctant to even help.
988,Spent two hours disputing an increase from an original estimate of 30 $ to a final delivery of 100$ - with 3 substitutions .
988,..One of the items substituted was feta with a sticker price of 8 dollars which appeared to become an 18 dollar item - even though item doesn't come up when you search for it - and non of the items cost as much in Uber ..After talking for 2 hours with support and them telling me - that they can charge what ever they want and not provide an itemized receipt that would show how the coast of my order increased by 70$.
988,.Not responding Uber one employee Shivan Gupta started to teach me about fairness.
988,And in the end completely ignored my questions and stopped responding at all.
988,".So it was my final experience with the platform, And how lovely was it especially after paying a 10$ fee for such a privilege."
988,.Great experience
1333,Something always goes wrong with every order.
1333,Often it takes 2x as long as the original estimate to get the food.
1333,Other times drivers will leave food at the completely wrong location.
1333,"Most recently the driver texted me to say the restaurant never got the order and I have to cancel and retry...From the users perspective it's pretty clear: here's my order, here's the money, please bring it to my location."
1333,"On the backend, it's an absolute disaster of restaurants and drivers getting paid way too little to put any effort in, and the result is something goes wrong...Order directly from the restaurant when you can."
1333,Pick it up yourself when you can.
1333,Use doordash as a last result and keep your expectations low.
103,Best drivers.
103,"Efficient, professional, and food comes closed in packaging so it seems safe but the price to order with all the fees adds up quick."
103,I only order from 3rd party delivery sites when I'm being really lazy or sick or use a place that doesn't have their own delivery ppl.
103,"It's an expensive last resort, yet reliable."
103,Way better than door-dash drivers who typically just don't care and will argue
681,"They lie on their website saying if you receive incorrect items and missing items, you'll receive a refund."
681,"I ordered pizzas that were never delivered, the driver and restaurant can confirm."
681,I have a picture of brownies in a pizza box to further prove it.
681,They put brownies in pizza boxes instead.
681,I never submitted a refund request before.
681,They keep saying my order is not eligible for refund but won't explain why.
681,"When I asked why it isn't eligible, they stopped responding to me through the app and twitter."
681,DO NOT RISK LOSING YOUR MONEY.
681,The worst customer service I have ever experienced and I will never use any Uber services again.
681,A billion dollar company stealing money from their customers is a shame.
681,Do not use Uber even if it's a last resort.
118,Please allow for option to edit a review for up at least 24hrs.
118,"For example, based on a previous experience with the restaurant itself, I decided to give it a good review."
118,"However not only did restaurant give incorrect drink, but the food was waaay too salty once I actually did get a change to eat."
118,Like dangerously salty and I split the sandwich in half with someone else.
118,Neither of us were able to enjoy and cost of meal was ridiculous $$
123,Possibly hacked.
123,"Tried updating my Home address on the order, but then said it delivered to my Work address, so I contacted the driver and she went off a nonexistent address with 10 higher digits to my street address numbering and delivered it to someone else."
123,"To correct customer service graciously sent another delivery, but the address was then transposed, so I contacted them 7 times to update it and even contacted the driver, but no one got my address right so I just waited out on the middle of my street for the food and flagged the driver down."
123,"I don't get it, might be hacked"
166,this has got to be the worst app experience i have ever come across.
166,"i wanted to order something through my university, but had an error message along the lines of ""there are some fields that haven't been filled in""."
166,i can assure you i filled in all the required fields.
166,"i restarted the app, deleted it and re-downloaded it, nothing worked."
166,i then went to chat with someone from grubhub support.
166,"i told them my situation, and the person then proceeded to leave the chat without reason or notice."
166,"i then tried to chat with someone else, and they said to restart the app (which didn't work) or order using the website (for the life of me i can't figure out how to order from a restaurant on my campus through the app)."
166,so not only is the app shut but it would seem the customer service is as well.
343,"They give you the option to have ""contact less delivery"" or in person delivery."
343,When I pick the in person option they still leave my food at the gate.
343,So many times someone else took my food or they just delivered it to the wrong address.
343,Much easier to drive to the restaurant and pickup the food myself.
433,Grubhub does not care about their customers or how good their drivers are.
433,"The driver brought me someone else's order, so I got a refund and ordered again."
433,The driver then brought me my ORIGINAL order.
433,Some of the boxes had clearly been opened and it was COLD.
433,I never got the new order I placed.
433,Tried to refund but it never went through.
433,WTH.
532,Listen guys don't waste your money on food deliveries it's not worth it at the end of the day.
532,Ever since I got this app I've had one problem after another.
532,"They always get my order wrong or deliver my food to someone else, the drivers rarely at times check if they are even delivering to the right place to begin with."
532,I on 3 occasions have gotten spoiled food and that's including last night.
532,I spent a total of 40hrs max trying to get refund and all the help I got was bot responses.
532,I had proof of the inconveniences and they still denied to refund me because I wasn't eligible even though I was eligible according to their guidelines.
532,I fell sick to my stomach and I had to throw my food away.
532,"After fighting for so long I managed to get the attention of two supervisors and a manager, can y'all guess what they said?"
532,"They all responded with the same bot messages lol, I was about to lose it."
532,This company makes $57.6 Billion and they are fighting so hard on not refunding me my $36.
532,Would you imagine if I ate more than I should've of that spoiled food my accident and gotten food poisoning or something else?
541,"Worst food delivery service, will never use Uber Eats again."
541,Placed an order for lunch and delivery est said 25-30 mins.
541,Waited over an hour for the delivery driver to arrive only to find out he did not have the order at all.
541,"""Someone else picked up your order"" Because we gave him our PIN number, we could not submit a complaint through the app (the automated response was ""you gave your driver the pin, enjoy your food!"""
541,"Wish I could, but it never came!"
541,So we tracked down the customer service number to speak to a real person and get our money back.
541,They called the driver to find out what happened but could not get a hold of him.
541,"The rep offered to give us a full refund but said we would have to call them back after our credit card payment has fully processed, in 1 to 2 days."
541,Why can't you just void the credit card transaction?
541,"Why did the driver come all the way to our house just to tell us he didn't have it, and then collect the pin so we could not cancel the order?"
541,Scam!
547,"On account creation, a promotion was applied to my account until next month for free delivery."
547,"I should be applauding their customer care and service for that, but instead it has completely ruined my experience with Uber Eats."
547,"Whenever I press checkout, I get an error message that says ""The promotion you applied couldn't be processed"" and cancels my checkout."
547,"Since this promo was a part of the new account process, I can't take it off and thus can't order...I've reached out twice to customer support about this, and both times been told there's nothing they can do, and that they are referring me to someone else over email."
547,That email has never come.
547,It boggles my mind this company is ok with only disrespecting their customer's time and money.
547,I even asked if I could just take the free delivery off and spend MORE money and that's also not possible...I waited and waited for an email that never came and ended up going to bed hungry.
547,"If that doesn't speak volumes for their values, I don't know what else I could say to change your mind.l"
549,"I used to use Uber eats often because it was obviously convenient and I currently don't have the luxury of leaving my apartment right now, but I will gladly use anyone else."
549,"It started with a mess up here and there but now every single order I have placed in the past 4 months has had either missing food, canceled after an hour, or delivered to a completely different place."
549,They used to atleast refund your money right away but now it will either take 10 business days or it can be credited it back to your account which only helps if you can afford to pay for you meal twice (or sometimes 3 times) initially and then be credited back your money.
549,I kid you not - I had to spend $80 for a single burrito because the drivers kept messing it up.
549,I'd be more understanding if I hadn't used this as well as a driver and know how easy it is to double check yourself.
549,With all the different delivery apps nowadays - I'd save yourself the money and frustration and use someone else with better standards.
569,There is no reason why a driver should be able to accept an order and then go on about their business completely out off the way of the restaurant that they accepted the order for.
569,I placed an order for a fast food restaurant that is less than 10mins away.
569,"The driver proceeded to accept the order, drive past the restaurant, and then drive 20+ mins away from the area before heading BACK towards the restaurant to pick up the order."
569,"I understand that there a surely a shortage of drivers, but a driver should not be able to accept an order and then drive x amount of miles away from the restaurant and delivery area."
569,"The order should be able to be accepted by someone else if a driver proceeds out of a certain radius, if they have not actually picked up the order from the restaurant yet."
591,Ordered food for me and my family today because I am sick and couldn't cook anything for them.
591,"After waiting several minutes for my order, I checked the app again and it showed that it has been completed."
591,Now instead of calling the driver I opened the app to see where my food was dropped off.
591,"Lo and behold, It was sitting in front of my neighbors house!"
591,"I checked the option where it allows you to just click on ""current location"" and it picked up my next door neighbors house…Fix this problem dammit!"
591,"If this was to happen to someone else, the people next door wouldve claimed the food and blame would've been on the person who ordered for not checking the delivery address."
591,"The point of having ""Current Location"" option is to pin point the actual delivery address!!"
591,!
594,Reminder for these drivers that handed the food to someone else.
594,A person pretends to be me just to get my food and my driver just handed the food to him.
594,I saw him handed the food to someone else and I might be thinking that wasn't my order because I could understand that the driver might have the same delivery to the same address but not.
594,He just drove away with my food to a stranger!.
594,Please be mindful who you handed your food!.
594,"I'm working overtime for 16hrs for a double shift and I'm too tired to go to a restaurant so I decided to use Uber eats, but Uber Eats drivers makes me starved and makes me delete this app and never use this anymore."
594,I could gave 0 stars for handling my food to somebody and a refund wasn't enough!.
594,"I don't want to wait and set ""PRIORITY"" just to get delivered quickly."
594,Send me another food because I'm starving!!!.
594,Refund or not!
594,I paid for it.
594,I needed the food!.
624,"Tips are said to be calculated before taxes and fees yet when I do the math, are always more than the 20% I usually tip."
624,"My orders are constantly delayed with no explanation, just GENERAL information on why delays happen."
624,I often am paying a delivery fee with extra deliveries added to my trip.
624,"When I am paying a delivery fee and other stops are added after my order is placed, i should not have to foot the bill for someone else's delivery or my order should at least be delivered first!"
624,I have been using Uber eats for YEARS very very often (even had the special membership at one point) and am so sick of these issues coming up so frequently.
624,I ordered food TWO HOURS ago and it is still not here.
624,The ETA keeps getting pushed back because of orders being added to my route.
624,I'm done using Uber eats.
640,"At first, this just seems expensive."
640,But I used it a lot.
640,But then you realize it's expensive and your food arrives late and cold.
640,"And then you get told ""tough luck""."
640,"They also do ""batch deliveries""."
640,They don't tell you about that when you're ordering.
640,So your food travels across town to someone else's house getting cold and soggy before arriving at to you.
640,"Let's be very clear what's happening here...Uber has decided to delay your order, let it get cold and ruined, in order for them to make another delivery."
640,These other deliveries may not be anywhere near your house.
640,"I then let them know about the cold delayed food and got a ""too bad"" message."
640,So you get cold expensive food with a huge delivery fee and when something goes wrong you get nothing?
640,Why would anyone use this app?
657,"I talked to two customer service on chat, called and got connected to a supervisor and my issue was not fixed."
657,My order was delivered at the wrong unit.
657,"I contacted the driver, and he said he would try to get my order back to me but he never came."
657,And stopped answering his phone.
657,They are not able to give me a refund for an order I didn't receive.
657,"It doesn't make sense to pay, without receiving anything."
657,"At least someone else is eating good with a free meal, however my son isn't able to eat I have to reorder through doordash."
657,Please run and download doordash delete this app to save you some money.
657,"When the time comes that your delivery driver takes ur food somewhere else beside your doorstep, uber will not care and leave you dry."
657,"Save your money, order somewhere else"
904,Pretty much impossible to cancel an order even though I tried within seconds of clicking the order button.
904,I called the assigned uber driver and he told me he cancelled the order for me.
904,I put my phone away because I was at a memorial service.
904,"Next thing you know, my order gets dropped off by someone else and I'm charged $55 even though the first driver told me my order was cancelled."
904,"Support was not helpful, refused to give any sort of refund or even credit even though I was literally told my order was cancelled."
990,What would you like.
990,"Outrageous prices, slow deliveries, your delivery driver dropping off someone else's food when it would've been faster to drop off your food first, cancelled orders constantly."
990,Well if you'd like all of the above download this app and watch your 10 dollar order turn into a 21 dollar order.
990,Get doordash or grubhub because this app is a true money grab.
990,"Currently waiting on my food that's been ""on the move"" for an hour."
990,(I live 12 min from the restaurant I ordered from)
1015,I ordered from Rad lobster last night right after I ordered I took a shower when I came down stairs to check the status of the order it said I canceled it!
1015,First lie!
1015,Come to find out that my order had been given to someone else.
1015,"I said I would like to reorder,but I'm not paying for it."
1015,They said they could not do that .
1015,Second lie!
1015,The next thing I see is four different orders from four different Rad lobsters.
1015,I told them to cancel all orders and they said they will!
1015,I woke up this morning and sure enough there is 4 orders on my account!
1015,I tried to delete them and I got all but one!
1015,When I opened my door to go to work there is a red lobster sitting on my side porch.
1015,I'm assuming it's been there all night since y'all do not daliver at700 in the morning!
1015,"Y'all can come pick up this order and trash it, but I'm not paying for it!"
1028,I thought I'd have my food for lunch today at work and I get a text saying it arrived.
1028,It's not at my building where I work at like not even here it's at some other building not even close to mine.
1028,I even gave her a tip before ordering and I most definitely regret it.
1028,And it's even more annoying knowing I can't get a refund because the driver dropped it off so it would be in my possession but how is it in my possession when it's not even at my job someone else has my food right now.
1028,I'm never getting this app or any food delivery app again I'll do better taking my time to get my own food.
1102,I barely use postmates because I always have complications.
1102,"I decided to use it today because I had a coupon but it said my food was delivered, but I never got it."
1102,I live at a university and wrote specific instructions to hand it to me.
1102,"Either the driver gave it to someone else and didn't confirm, or kept it for himself."
1102,Such an unorganized app with horrible deliverers.
1133,Today I placed an order with DD and received someone else's order.
1133,I contacted DD Customer service and asked them to please send out another dasher to deliver my order since the wrong order was delivered.
1133,I was told they couldn't do that.
1133,I said they need to send my order or refund the full amount paid and again I was told my request was denied due to previous compensation.
1133,Mind you this so called compensation I received previously was nearly $800 charged to my credit card that I in no way charged and could not find any of these charges on my DD account.
1133,As a matter of fact I was told by one of their customer service reps that sometimes this happens and unfortunately people hack into their system and steal customer information.
1133,So not only is our information not secure but basically because my bank's fraud department investigated and found these charges were not mine DD has decided to steal my money when there is mistakes made by the restaurant.
1133,I guess from now on I just need to pick up my own stuff.
1133,It's obvious this company are not honest and put us at risk any time we use them of having our cards charged outrageous amounts.
1133,For all I know it was DD themselves or one of their many rude customer service representatives that charged nearly $800 to my card!
1215,I've been on DoorDash for a while and most of the time don't have problems.
1215,But here of late it seems Doordash will let any idiot with a license work for them.
1215,Today I ordered a burger with biscuits and gravy.
1215,"Instead I received someone else's order of tater tots, chilli cheese fries and something else idk."
1215,"..Doordash I'm talking to you, CHECK who you let drive for you."
1215,"I use this app when I can't get food in the house and when I receive the wrong order or missing items because YOU hired incompetent people that happen to have a license, it makes you look bad."
1215,The only thing consistent about your services is the fact your drivers are NEVER consistent or correct.
1215,"They deliver items to wrong addresses, steal food, flat out don't deliver, or can't seem to tell he difference between one order and another."
1215,Fix this or a better app will replace you and people will happily flock to a delivery service that knows what they're doing.
1217,"Yes, I personally have the ability to go out and grab my food."
1217,But what if I was sick or I couldn't or my circumstances were more severe?
1217,This isn't the best app to use if your order gets messed up.
1217,My experience was really terrible over compensated apologies from customer service…which seemed more like a robot.
1217,When I tried to resolve my problem they said it was outside of the window of resolution but never told me upon submitting my issue how long I had to resolve it.. so that's interesting..
1217,"The company isn't customer service forward, ok."
1217,It's about getting cash quickly and dusting your hands of actually having to be involved with dealing with minor issues.
1217,".If you plan to have a company, be prepared to deal with people and serve them if they pay for your expensive fees."
1217,".and if not, I guess in 5 years someone else will find a way to do it better."
1217,.I'd think I'd consider the Uber app instead if I were you.
1221,Today my order was not delivered and I had proof because the restaurant told me that the order was still sitting there but Doordash showed it was delivered.
1221,I asked Doordash to fix the order delivery so someone else could pick it up.
1221,They told me that they couldn't do this and they did not give me a refund either.
1221,"..I am extremely upset since I'm a high ordering customer - I order almost every 2 days and I rarely report issues, the last issue I reported that resulted in a refund was in Sept 2022."
1221,I don't blame the customer support folks since they were also frustrated and unable to help.
1221,However I do 100% blame the company policy and structures that limits their support team in truly caring for their customers.
1221,..I am a strong believer in customer support and loyalty and don't prop up companies who will leave their customers hanging.
1221,So I will stop using Doordash in the future and urge others to do the same.
1252,I have an issue were I order something even with paying for premium fast delivery were drivers will add to there route and deliver to people who ordered after first and wait at other restaurants by the time I get my food it's 30 to 40 minutes past delivery time and my food is ice cold because the drivers are not using hot bags and it's way over the delivery time and I've had 3 instances of drivers dropping food off around the block from my house I've lucked out and managed to get it before someone else has but there needs to be consistency across the board cause if you think about say you order a gyro like I did today it has lettuce in it by the time I get it it's super soggy and already gone cold even though i pay for fast delivery and dashpass
491,"I cancelled my dash pass once I found out that plus was included with prime, and my very first order was cancelled."
491,I then couldn't use first time order promos when I went to order again.
491,Support did not help.
491,"..Also, I can use door dash much later than I can this app."
667,I typically use Dash Pass but wanted to try Uber One out.
667,"This isn't about the restaurants, because I've learned they are all trashy at making food and getting orders correct."
667,"But when there is a problem, Uber can't help, there's no person to talk to."
667,Dash pass takes 10 seconds to fix or refund me.
667,Uber takes 10 years to find the help button and still doesn't fix anything.
667,You are left waiting for an email that never arrives!
667,"Going back to dash pass, they also don't allow you to change the tip, which I fear for the Uber drivers getting ripped off when it's not there fault the order is wrong!!"
667,I still give good tips because gas is expensive!
667,!
1136,Door dash has made it IMPOSSIBLE to cancel your dash pass subscription.
1136,They will try every card on your account and you always have to have at least one card on file.
1136,"The only way to cancel is by calling, I did so and got confirmation of the cancellation yet I was still charged."
1136,"Called again, they transferred me 3 times for literally no reason and eventually sent me to the post call survey."
1136,The first woman on the phone was yelling at me about how there was no cancellation in their system when I repeatedly stated that I had an email saying the opposite.
1136,"They want me to provide the date of the charge, card number, exact amount…my apple credit card doesn't have numbers and I shouldn't have to go through the trouble of finding one, whatever that process may look like."
1136,How could it be possible that they don't have the information themselves!?
1136,They have no issue taking my money but it seem like the customer service employees are trained to be horrible and do whatever they can to never give money back.
1136,Be aware of this SCAM!
1136,This company has gotten so bad!
1136,"In addition to that, I recently ordered food that came hours late and was cold (surprise) door dash offered $3.47 in credit."
1136,I use to use this app as my go to for delivery but NEVER AGAIN.
1146,Update: door dash so kindly gave me my account back allowed me to pay for dash pass TWICE WHILE SIMULTANEOUSLY DEACTIVATING MY ACCOUNT!
1146,AGAIN!
1146,And I have deleted the app but somehow they're still using my location!
1146,So done with this app and company 10/10 would not recommend 👎🏼👎🏼👎🏼👎🏼👎🏼👎🏼👎🏼👎🏼.After calling and calling since August I was finally told today they deactivated my account due to violation of term and conditions but they don't know what terms and conditions were violated and didn't have the ability to reactivate my account or refund my money.
1146,Also NOBODY AT THE COMPANY COULD TELL ME WHY!
1146,When I asked if I created another account if it would be deactivated I am NOT EVEN KIDDING YOU WHEN I SAY A TIER 2 CSR HUNG UP ON ME!!!!
1146,WORST ABSOLUTE WORST EXPERIENCE WITH CUSTOMER SERVICE I'VE EVER HAD!
1146,"My account was deactivated and nobody can tell me why, I have waited since Tuesday (it's now Saturday) for it to be reactivated when they said it would be fixed in 24 hours."
1146,"I have also waited for a refund from them since MAY ITS NOW AUGUST customer service ""escalates"" the concerns to tier 2 but nothing is ever fixed!"
1146,I'm seriously over DoorDash and their shotty customer service.
1146,The local delivery drivers are excellent but the csr line pathetic
1158,"Service and times are mediocre, the tip is being billed before the service is complete, which equals a fact that we can't tip accordingly, especially  to level of service received."
1158,This makes tipping a good faith thing.
1158,You don't understand how many times I wished I could have lowered the tip because the delivery quality or time sucked.
1158,Which is totally the reason why I don't use this or any service often anymore.
1158,So why pay for dash pass?
1158,That would not be fiscally unreasonable.
1158,..DoorDash inc. isn't as great as the big headed company thinks it is.
1158,It promotes customers to be lazy and wasteful.
1158,Over ordering is also too common.
1158,..We all need to stop looking for easy buttons and paying a premium for lackluster service.
1158,"I'd rather just take the family to the diner anymore, at least there I have a face to face level of service and workers are much more inclined to feel guilty when they neglect a paying customer."
1158,And I can always promote or warn the management of there representatives in person.
1159,So I paid for the yearly DoorDash pass back in February throughout the couple of months I've had a few times where my order didn't show up or they bought me the wrong order not that many times but less than less than 10 more than four I made an order today at McDonald's it came to $30 more I only received my fries and a drink they forgot the other bag I was told they couldn't give me a refund becauseIt was too many things that went wrong on my account so it doesn't matter if it's their fault that they gave you the wrong order and you have pictures of receipts and everything if you complain about not receiving what You've paid for they say you've had too many unsatisfactory transactions and say sorry but we're keeping your money even though you didn't receive your goods they stole my money and will not give it back to me in credits or anything I cancel this account I would not suggest anybody spend any money with these fees what they're doing is illegal and I am currently talking to my friend who is a civil rights activist because I want to place a class action lawsuit
1165,"It seems like every other order of not more, are arriving 30+ min late, missing items, dropped off at the wrong location, sometimes my food never arrives."
1165,"The best one to see is the dasher is having car issues… I've canceled my dash pass several times now, just to use Uber eats and go right back to door dash."
1165,"Uber eats is super expensive, even with their subscription."
1165,But door dash is the most unreliable service I've used in my life.
1165,"I've recently just had a chat with customer support because one of my orders weren't getting delivered, and it was already 20 min past the time of delivery and they were 20 min away."
1165,They also picked up my food by the time they stop.
1165,"The support person was the least charismatic person I've meet, telling me their insuring my food wouldn't be cold and it would arrive soon."
1165,Then they just stop the chat out of nowhere… the food was cold and it took a hour an 30 min when it was expected to take 25 min.
1165,"I've spent thousands on door dash in a few years, and nothing gets fixed, you might get some credits but not your food."
1179,Used DoorDash and paid for their dash pass for close to 2 years used serval times a week.
1179,Recently made an order that they charged me 25% more for the food items than what was actually charged on the receipt from the restaurant.
1179,"Attempted to find a resolution from their ""customer service"" which was met with hostile and unnecessary aggression."
1179,"They transferred me 4 different times to different ""experts"" who requested full card information."
1179,Explained this was not secure and was unnecessary considering the documentation I had.
1179,After becoming frustrated in told them if they would like to keep my business they could call me which never happened.
1179,Today the card authorization was completed and the charge was not adjusted.
1179,"I have no way verify if other orders I have placed in the past had this same issue, but I refuse to be taken advantaged of again like this."
1179,"I have deleted me account and will not use their services again, which seems to be the resolution they wanted since no attempt to contact me was made at all."
1186,DoorDash used to be great.
1186,"But now that they're trying to get as many orders done in one route as possible, it takes over an hour and a half to get your food from a store 5-10 minutes away."
1186,It's been cold and soggy every time.
1186,Sounds dumb to complain about.. it basically ruins the food and makes it less convenient than getting it yourself.
1186,Also SO annoying it doesn't give YOU the option to adjust your tip AFTER you receive your food.
1186,You have to contact customer support.
1186,"I give them ALL the info and verification they need without it taking 10 minutes to tip, but they drag out the conversation, get easily confused, and waste my time."
1186,"I'll be at work and give them EVERYTHING they need upfront then say ""please adjust gtg thanks"", but they'll say ""How's your day going"" and close the chat if im not small talking and pointlessly sitting on my phone waiting for them to wrap it up."
1186,Probs cancelling my dash pass and going to Uber eats.
1198,I've been an avid DoorDash user for years.
1198,DoorDash in the past has always made it right for me when a restaurant has screwed up and I always provide proof of the screwup.
1198,These screwups by restaurants are unfortunately fairly frequent.
1198,"Now tho, DoorDash is no longer providing refunds for anything it seems."
1198,Didn't get your food?
1198,Too bad we have a no refund policy.
1198,Got the wrong order?
1198,Too bad no refunds?
1198,"All wrong toppings on your burgers, bowls, etc?"
1198,Too bad no refunds.
1198,I've heard this same feedback from others and it's making me seriously doubt that I'll renew my dash pass after my current year is up.
1198,I've lost more money in the past month on non refunded screwups than I have saved with the fee waivers.
1198,If you don't want to take responsibility for the restaurants on your platform don't be surprised when you either lose customers or have people continuously making new accounts or finding some other way around this awful new policy.
1198,👎👎👎
1199,It's sad because for years now I've used DoorDash and paid for dash pass — little did I know that Uber eats is still less expensive even when you have dash pass.
1199,I compared an order from Uber eats from the same place and Door Dash was $7 more expensive (that's dash pass versus no membership with Uber Eats).
1199,I can only imagine how much more expensive it would have been if I didn't have dash pass (prob closer to $15 more).
1199,"Honestly, I feel cheated — additionally, even with dash pass you have to pay extra for ""express"" delivery; meaning, they send the delivery driver off in a random direction in the wrong way before delivering to you if you don't pay the feel."
1199,I have a screenshot of door dash trying to send the driver ~15 mins in the wrong direction when I was 3 mins away from the restaurant… fortunately the driver called and told me he would bring me my food first.
1199,Very disappointing.
1206,Look I LOVED door dash.
1206,I've had and used a dash pass regularly since it became available!
1206,"For a long time, this was great, but recently, 9 times out of 10 my order is missing something."
1206,"Whether it be my drink, my sides, ingredients I wanted added or removed, or sometimes even whole entrees."
1206,"..And for the first month or so, door dash was good about refunding missing items."
1206,"Something changed though, and now when a $9 item is missing, they only offer a $2 DOOR DASH CREDIT, and recently, they can't even give me that."
1206,"The last time I used them, all of my family's sides were missing, probably costing close to $20 and they offered zero compensation."
1206,I'm losing money AND I don't get what I ordered.
1206,"And whether it's the store's fault or the dasher's fault, I still pay for things I don't receive."
1206,It's frustrating and a waste of money.
1206,"This was great during COVID, but now I'd rather just go pick up my food so I can be SURE that I have everything."
1209,Honestly I've spent thousands of dollars over several years with this company and they can never get anything right.
1209,It now takes HOURS for my food to arrive when it used to be fairly reliable and reasonable just about a year ago.
1209,"Now you have to PAY EXTRA on top of paying a dash pass fee to get your food ""faster."""
1209,That's the whole point of a dash pass?
1209,Never had to pay that until recently.
1209,.I've ordered an hour ahead so it can get here on time when I'm taking lunch at work and it still takes them 2 hours to get a dasher to bring my food.
1209,Maybe DoorDash should pay their drivers more and have less restrictions on who can dash because I tried to dash myself for over two years and they never accept me.
1209,Take care of your dashers and maybe you'll be able to retain the good ones.
1209,Do better DoorDash.
1209,I'm cancelling my dash pass with you and using another platform now.
1209,You lost yet another loyal customer and their business!
1220,"For some given reason my app just decided to lag so bad when ever I try searching up restaurants or stores or just do anything it general, adding to the wound, some local stores don't show up on my account but as soon as I log off and continue as guest they appear right ways but of course the amount I pay for delivery would be way more since I won't be able to use the dash pass I have in my actual account."
1220,When I reached out to customer support about it all I was told was to wait and see if the problem go fixed by their updates however it seems that every update just keeps making it worst and worst.
1220,help anyone 🤷‍♂️
1229,I renewed my dash pass and went to place an order.
1229,The app crashed I check my email and it says you have been refunded and your account has been deactivated.
1229,Contacted customer service and was rerouted to 4 people before I could get my account activated.
1229,Waste my time.
1229,After 30 minutes reactivated account.
1229,I went to renew dash pass and same thing happens again.
1229,So annoyed decided to deal with it the next day.
1229,Contacted customer service and same process happens.
1229,"Did it a fourth time, no agent."
1229,"Fifth time, agent does not listen and continues process and tells me your account will be reactivated check email."
1229,24 hours later no email.
1229,"Horrible customer service doesn't listen and can't resolve same issue, over 10 agents and still same issue."
1229,Will be using Grubhub from now on.
1229,I would recommend anyone wanting to try DoorDash to not waste your time.
1243,if I could give zero stars I would.
1243,"Using another card on an account can result in the cardholder being charged for dashpass for months, even after the account owner removes the card and cancels DoorDash on their account."
1243,This means that multiple people can be paying for a dashpass that DOES NOT EXIST.
1243,That's not all!
1243,"sometimes they will charge you once, sometimes TWICE a month for the same dashpass."
1243,What does this mean?
1243,Well multiple members of my family have been both paying for my sister's dash pass.
1243,"We are talking about being charged $20, $30, $40 a month for a service NOT PROVIDED."
1243,This level of negligence is embarrassing at best and fraud at worst.
1243,didn't sign up for DoorDash at all?
1243,"Don't worry, they will still find a way to steal your money!"
1243,Plenty online have mentioned being charged for a pass despite never signing up for a trial in the first place!
1248,I am a dash pass member.
1248,I frequently order groceries from a local retailer.
1248,"Whenever they do not have an item, a refund is processed for the item."
1248,So if I order 25 things and 5 are not available they have to refund me for 5.
1248,"Well in the system it looks like I am always requesting refunds, which I am not."
1248,So if I order from a restaurant and do not receive all of my items I am unable to get refunded because the computer looks at all refunds the same.
1248,So in a sense it is not worth it to get the Dash pass because if I am missing items they refuse to refund me my money from fast food restaurants.
1248,It is very frustrating.
1248,And they do not take your word over a $5 item.. not good customer service at all…
1280,"This app works great but over the past couple of months, I've noticed that everything is more expensive than the actual restaurants charge — I'll literally go on the restaurant's website and see their cost for the item.. and then on Door Dash, it's anywhere between $3-$6 more… per item!!"
1280,That's ridiculous.
1280,"Between all of the extra fees and increase on food items, it's cheaper for me to just use gas and pick up directly from the restaurant instead of going through DD."
1280,At least the restaurant won't charge the extra fees (and I'm a Dash Pass member too..).
1280,Is DD pocketing the difference between what the restaurant charges and what's on the app?
1280,?
1305,I ordered food then double dashed a bag a chips from another store.
1305,Instead of them having one dasher do the delivery they had two different dashers.
1305,But the first dasher received both orders and when he went to get the chips my order for him disappeared because they sent the second dasher for the chips.
1305,I spoke with the first dasher and he said he spoke with DoorDash and they told him he canceled the order himself which he didn't they sent a second dasher and just lied to him.
1305,Not to mention the second dasher delivered the chips to the wrong address and DoorDash refused to refund me for it.
1305,I canceled my dash pass and will never use this app again.
1305,They refused to take the blame or solve the problem your better off with postmates or Uber eats.
1305,Save yourself the trouble do NOT use this app.
1321,I have had multiple issues with dashers not bringing my order or missing parts of it.
1321,Then all they want to do is give you credits.
1321,Well after the dasher just lied and said my food was delivered when it was not.
1321,I don't want to place another order then and have it happen again.
1321,Then I have an issue where they charge me $96 for dash pass instead of my normal 9.99.
1321,I called and finally got someone on the phone who informed me that he does not know why it happens.
1321,He also said it has happened to multiple people.
1321,Then says that it will take 7 days to get refunded.
1321,If you know that there has been issues for a while you should fix it!
1321,I don't know about everyone else but $96 is a lot of money to be just gone in a blink for me.
460,Tried to order 4 times from 4 different places.
460,Every time the order could not be completed for reasons unknown.
460,"Clicked a 5th restaurant to order, but instead of taking me to the menu, it redirected to home page."
460,I wanted to give you my money at first but decided 5th strike?
460,Yerrrr outta here!
1139,"For context, I'm trying out DoorDash as my new go-to delivery app because I get complimentary DashPass with my new credit card."
1139,"The app is generally functional and looks nice (if a bit busy from all the deals up top that I have no interest in), but it was an infuriating experience trying to browse through available restaurants."
1139,"Every time I clicked on a restaurant and spent more than a few seconds looking at its offerings, hitting ""back"" arrow( not ""reset""!)"
1139,would send me back to the top of the Home page with my filters wiped.
1139,This makes finding and trying new places inconvenient and an exercise in patience.
1139,"If I'm being cynical, maybe the idea is to make it so annoying to do so that the user just gives up and settles for whatever sponsored restaurants are at the top of the Home page, if they don't just give up on DoorDash."
1139,"I used UberEats primarily before (and I hate to pull out the comparison card), but while it has its own issues, I've apparently been taking for granted being able to scroll through even a list of restaurants while checking out their menus—in a food ordering app."
1147,I placed an order for a restaurant near me via doorDash.
1147,"It said I can pick up in 40 min, so I walked away to do other things during this time."
1147,"When I came back, Doordash said my order is canceled."
1147,I called the restaurant to find out why and was told Doordash attached a nuts allergy note to my order and they can't honor it.
1147,This is the second time this happened.
1147,I start chat support with Doordash to get them to remove it.
1147,"After spending more than an hour with Doordash chat support, I was told they can't remove it, that I have to remove it, and I can do it via Settings -> blue pencil icon."
1147,"I didn't see it and asked them where it is, starting from iOS app home page."
1147,They again can not answer and transferred me twice to special departments and ultimately has to open up a case to try to answer my question.
1147,What a disaster.
1147,Eight different people via chat support and everyone just reads from a script and no one actually knows where this mythical Settings button is.
1147,"The app is so poorly designed and causes time to be unnecessarily wasted, leaving you angry and still hungry."
1147,"Ultimately it can't even do what it's made to do, which is to order food and make sure you get it."
1239,"DoorDash is certainly convenient sometimes, but the app can be somewhat frustrating."
1239,"It's possible that some of the problems are because of the way restaurants enter information—I have no idea how it works on that end—so I'll stick with my biggest gripe: when I use the filters on the home page of the app and then spend a few seconds too long looking at a restaurant page (less than a minute is apparently too long, the filters have been reset when I come back."
1239,And then I have to set them again and start the whole process over.
1239,Extremely obnoxious.
1239,"I know I'm not the only person who needs to browse, so how about keeping the filters until a person resets them or until they order?"
89,I work at a cafe and yesterday someone called us to see if we were open because their delivery time kept getting pushed back and I had to tell them the driver just hasn't shown up yet.
89,Five hours later the food was still there and my shift was over.
89,It's actually becoming a joke in my cafe that they're never going to pick up the food.
582,I have updated this app numerous times and I even re installed on a brand new device..
582,I don't know what it is but every time I make it to the end where I submit order the screen goes black and has the white circle like phone is thinking then I have to re open or restart the app.
582,"On top of that the app doesn't allow me to respond to the driver within the chat it freezes and acts like I am not writing, this is a serious annoyance and inconvenience .. Uber has zero answers for me about it …."
582,"Other than that… the app itself outside of function, is what it is."
582,Using Uber eats for daily delivery needs can be great but it also can be bad depending where you're located if the restaurant partners in area don't have good service or common sense … drivers included
722,I just want to give a shout to Uber Eats tonite.
722,Had a rough day and needed food last minute.
722,"There wasn't anyone to deliver in enough time at first until, a driver decided to take a night owl trip."
722,They deserve kudos for making my delivery happen so late.
722,Not many places are open this late so I was very grateful to receive my order.
722,I'm the Millers Ale night owl order!
722,"So to the driver( who I am not naming for privacy purposes) who delivered my food late at night, you are the bomb!"
722,Thank you😊
822,I have been ordering group orders since the last two weeks of September and just about everyday I run into a problem.
822,"The biggest issues I have are; orders in my cart disappear, items are unavailable for next day delivery, items are multiplied on the order, and lately many restaurants are unavailable, even if they are open."
822,Ordering group meals has been frustrating to say the least and when I speak to a support agent I get no real good answer or my order gets screwed up even more.
1007,A few nights ago I placed an order on Postmates.
1007,It was late (1:30 am) and not a lot of places were open near me.
1007,I had to work early in the morning (7 am) and needed to go to bed but I was hungry and hadn't eaten since lunch (1 pm) the previous day.
1007,It said my food would arrive at 2:05am with priority delivery.
1007,For whatever reason the arrival time got pushed back to 2:30am and my order was ready for pickup around 2:15.
1007,On the map I watched my delivery driver circle the building and park about a block away from the restaurant.
1007,Then all of a sudden they cancelled my order after waiting over an hour and I had to start the process again eventually getting a delivery from a place I didn't want over 2 hours from the time I placed my original order.
1007,At least when you go to the ER they let you know that it's gonna take awhile before providing you with absolutely nothing that makes you feel any better.
1007,..Also Postmates will charge you more than the total it gives you when you place the order with absolutely no explanation of the additional cost 🤷🏼‍♂️
1142,"I've never had a problem with the service of door dash, any time my order was messed up which is rare they are super cool about refunding me and I have no complaints about my experiences as a customer."
1142,However a couple months or so ago the app on my phone became almost completely unusable.
1142,"You can barely scroll down the page it is super slow and glitchy, and if you do manage to get an order in it's even harder to do double dash because the menus for other store just will not open, it only lets me choose from the quick menu options that are right there immediately but if I try to open a stores page my app freezes and I have to re open."
1142,I normally like to get a 2 liter from 7-11 any time I order a meal and double dash was perfect for that but now it's so much of a hassle that it's not even worth it.
1142,I've deleted and re downloaded the app a few times and looked for updates and fixes and all of that but no luck.
1142,I'm at the point where I deleted the app and if I really need to use door dash in the future I'll just get on the computer.
31,There's nothing wrong with the app itself.
31,"I find it very easy to use, and it has many features that improve quality of life such as express reordering and multiple methods of payment...Customer service I've found to be divisive among people who use this app."
31,I personally have had nothing but good experiences.
31,"The representatives were kind, helpful, and able to resolve my issues quickly."
31,Hopefully you have the same care...But those issues all stemmed from one thing: the drivers.
31,I understand how busy they can be and how undertipped they are.
31,But sometimes they can't seem to follow simple instructions.
31,"I've had drivers not show up until 30 minutes after I was notified they would arrive, had orders have missing items, and some orders weren't even delivered to the right address."
31,..All I have to say is sometimes it's better to go get the food yourself.
31,Understand that you're placing your trust in one person to get your food and bring it to you.
31,Sometimes they'll fail to even do that.
31,"There are lots of amazing GrubHub drivers out there, trust me, but you're likely to have a few bad ones."
1080,"this app is only slightly better than doordash, but barely, i've had multiple orders either incorrect or missing items and have been refused refund's multiple times as well, there's also a new feature that you have to pay extra if you want your food to still be hot when it gets there, the drivers are rude and refuse to follow simple instructions, i've had drivers literally make me walk up to their window and they passed me the food from their car, i work in customer service too and sure i hate it but i still do my job, i thought the drivers would do the same 🤷🏻‍♀️"
1174,I can't believe I have to write this review today on November 7th around 3:00 I had a door dasher named Cristian.
1174,At my job we always order food to our work and today I decided to order food Cristian couldn't follow simple signs where they point where the entrance is instead he wants me to go out of my way to door he's at.
1174,I told him I simply can't because I'm working.
1174,At the entrance there's always workers that will receive the food for me.
1174,So instead he told me I'm wasting HIS time and just left it at a door on SOME MUD.
1174,When I finally had time to go the door he left it at I had to take the food out the bag but when I opened the bag my soup was spilled all over my food so I couldn't even eat it anymore.
1174,Im glad I was able to get a some what refund but that would never make up the experience I just had I smell like the soup and covered in it and now I have to wait to get home to eat because I don't ever want to order food on these apps again.
1174,Would be careful because when things happen like this all they can do is apologize.
1182,"I have had hundreds of dollars stolen from me from either the dashers or the company, many times I have no issues but on the off chances that I do, they say ""they see everything on a case by case basis"" and if that was true, wouldn't a dasher literally stealing your order warrant a refund in some way?"
1182,Doordash doesn't seem to think so.
1182,They seem to think it's not their fault or their drivers fault when you can literally watch the dasher drive to you.
1182,"Said dasher that stole our order ""claimed he was across the street"" when in the app he was 3 streets down and completed the order then proceeded to lie to us saying that we came out and signed for it when we were outside for 10 minutes and no cars came into our complex."
1182,And that's not the first time.
1182,‼️I swear the hire the most brain dead mouth breathing idiots to deliver for them‼️ the drivers can't follow simple instructions half the time when there not STEALING YOUR ORDER!!
1182,No other delivery app has given me this much trouble OR STOLEN THIS MUCH MONEY FROM ME AND MY KIDS!!!
1182,!
310,I am only continuing this app to finish out my trail.
310,The drivers do not follow directions.
310,The option is available to add notes for the deliver and they don't read them.
310,I had my food mars delivered just to have to have it reordered but the company.
310,I missed my lunch time and the food is cold most of the time it arrives… use at your own risk.
1099,"I've ordered a few times and each time the driver either took the food, took something from my order, or left it at an entirely different house."
1099,"When I try to contact customer support, it goes through a 3rd party that just hangs up on you."
1099,Absolutely unacceptable and highly unprofessional people work for this app.
1099,USE AT YOUR OWN RISK!
1287,Then this is the app for you!
1287,Did you order some nice soup and an iced coffee for lunch?
1287,"Well, you'll probably receive a pizza and a small order of rice."
1287,Did you order a late night pretzel and some coffee to get some work done?
1287,"Well, congratulations on your new Q-Tips and deodorant."
1287,"Be prepared for missing items as well (like the quesadilla that was conveniently missing from my last order)...In all seriousness, there's probably a 50% chance you're going to get the right items and you're going to pay a premium on them."
1287,"Anyone can be a Doordasher, and without serious oversight and punishment for dashers nothing will ever change...Use at your own risk or use if you want to get some random food or pharmacy items!"
1287,Random is fun sometimes.
583,"I sometimes badly need delivery on busy work days but this app is always hit or miss, with 50% of times getting deliveries that take beyond hour and half, at which point the food is already dry or soggy."
583,"Most drivers will cancel on deliveries to high population areas, even though the service charge can go up to 15 dollars."
583,If I were them I'd take that 15 dollars happily and deliver to even the most complicated residences.
583,But why do they still cancel?
583,Because Uber takes ridiculous amount of cut.
583,They even take a cut from the restaurant itself.
583,This is the most shameful and the most shady business practice I've ever seen in my life and I have no idea why people continue to use this god forsaken app.
583,"Do America a favor and delete this app...Not only that, customer service agent has been replaced by bots."
583,"I beg you people, just don't use this service."
964,Bad business practice.
964,"I ordered through Uber eats and immediately after, I realized it was the wrong location."
964,I called the restaurant immediately to cancel but they told me to do it through the app.
964,It took me a couple minutes to cancel with the app because I've never done it.
964,"The next day, I realized I was charged anyway."
964,So I paid for no food.
964,"I understand if Don't let me cancel but they should have told me, I would have taken the food."
964,"Don't ever use Uber too, so much fees and no customer service."
1135,[UPDATE 12/22] DoorDash consistently allows drivers to drop off food at the wrong location or to keep food for themselves without reimbursing the customers.
1135,Driver didn't contact you and then dropped your food off at some other unknown location?
1135,"Well, DoorDash will happily keep your money."
1135,It's not worth the risk.
1135,"If you have the ability to, get in your car and go to the restaurant."
1135,"DoorDash does not compensate their drivers fairly, literally steals money from customers, and their business practices are harmful to smaller restaurants."
1135,They are the worst choice for food delivery and should be avoided at all costs.
1135,"DoorDash overall is a nice concept, but the execution is poor here."
1135,"Their delivery fees are understandable, however they don't do anything to stop drivers from taking your food or to insure that drivers are incentivized enough to get your order."
1135,My most recent purchase was completely wrong to the fault of the restaurant.
1135,"Unfortunately, I had to go through DoorDash to rectify this."
1135,"They credited me for the burger, but no the large $3.99 delivery fee."
1135,"The food I received I physically couldn't even eat, yet DoorDash still passes the cost along to the consumer."
1135,"They're very anti-consumer, and they aren't great to the drivers either with deliveries that take up to 30 minutes for $2."
35,I placed an expensive order on Grubhub.
35,The driver never delivered the order to my apartment and order was not at other units or at any of the front doors of the building.
35,The driver never called or texts.
35,"And after the order claimed delivery, there was no option for me to contact the driver...The app does not enable users to write reviews for poor driving service."
35,"Therefore it seems if a driver steals food or leaves food in an unsecured area, the driver gets away with what was done...I did contact customer service and the order was replaced."
35,"However, there was no additional compensation for the additional wait time."
35,"After pressing hard with customer service, I was finally give a 20% discount on a future order, which expires in 1 month - why the expiration??"
35,"?..Regardless, I am frustrated that the driver is allowed to get away with this and that I have no way of being able to contact the driver to ask where the food is...Customer service ought to be more generous upfront when things like this happen to ensure customers remain loyal to their service...It was an awful experience."
35,And my impression of Grubhub has significantly reduced.
35,..I hope this review is shared up the chain of command.
35,Things like this need a solution and ought to be better handled so that their reputation is preserved.
676,"I barely write reviews, and when I do, I love to write a nice opinion, but unfortunately, this is a very horrible review."
676,"I wasn't driving for a while, so I was dependent on an app like Uber Eats."
676,The problem is that they ripped me off in many ways.
676,"I am a big guy, so I can eat."
676,I was being charged almost $50 to $60 for 2 to 3 items.
676,"When I was eating a lot, I could probably walk into a store and get about 8 items for the same price."
676,"This is because they not only hit you with so many fees and charges, but they also raise the cost of the item."
676,Now the time it takes to get to my home is being delayed.
676,"My best advice is that if you have the transportation to get to the restaurants, go there instead of wasting valuable money."
977,It's unreal how long I've been waiting for my order.
977,Uber's service has become increasing unreliable.
977,"After deleting the app, I added it recently to try the service again, I'm disappointed yet again to wait 2 hours for my order."
977,Never ordering from Uber Eats again.
977,"I never write reviews, as I simply don't continue to do business with a merchant who provides bad service, but UberEats takes the cake as the service was so terrible today I needed to share this feedback."
1144,"I don't typically write reviews for apps, but I just had to let everyone know how unreliable this app is."
1144,I've used DoorDash a total of 4 times and they have messed up my order 3 of those 4 times.
1144,"I am vegetarian and cannot eat any meat, and every time they tend to give me meat dishes instead of the vegetarian dishes I had ordered."
1144,I end up having to throw my food away.
1144,"The ""credits"" they issue when they mess up your order don't compensate for the money lost; for example, I ordered one dish from a restaurant and my total (after taxes, tip, etc.)"
1144,ended up being around $20.
1144,"When they messed up my order and gave me a meat dish, which I had to throw away, they only gave me $4 in ""credits."""
1144,"Even when I called customer service, they failed to give me a full refund and got away with only giving me $10 back."
1144,I essentially lost $10 through no fault of my own.
1144,"Not only is this app a waste of money, it's a waste of time."
1144,Waiting an hour for your food just for it to be inedible and without even being fairly compensated for the mistake time after time is exhausting.
1144,Don't bother using DoorDash and stick to other apps like Grubhub.
1144,"Even though it's more expensive, at least they never messed up my order."
1160,First of all I never write reviews so this is a first time for me which shows how bad of an experience this was.
1160,I placed an order and had specific instructions to leave an ingredient out of my dish.
1160,"The restaurant added the ingredient anyway, which I understand can happen at times."
1160,So I contacted DoorDash about the issue and the mistake on the store's end.
1160,The DoorDash agent told me I couldn't get a full refund even though I was not at fault.
1160,After frustratingly going back and forth as to why I couldn't get a full refund for the stores mistake I agreed to get paid back to my card.
1160,DoorDash issued me credits instead and after I contacted them about their mistake they said there was nothing they could do and I even had an agent disconnect on me mid chat.
1160,"I have screenshots and am tempted to take legal action, but I don't want anything to do with the sorry excuse for a company."
1160,I've never had a problem with Grubhub and if there's an issue they are more than willing to help you out with no issues on their end... Also the Double Dash feature doesn't always work.
1195,I love this app.
1195,I've been using it a lot especially since I'm a student who doesn't have their license.
1195,Most of the time my orders are great and my experience is aswell.
1195,"However, sometimes there's mix-ups like not getting an item you paid for, mixing up your order, etc."
1195,It's extremely aggravating but DoorDash Support has always compensated me every time without fail and had amazing customer service while doing so.
1195,"With an app like this, it's basically expected there will be some mistakes but DoorDash takes great pride in fixing the issue."
1195,I usually never even write reviews but the customer support representative I spoke with was so nice and understand I had to say my piece.
1195,Going to continue using this app for a long time!
1308,"I made a large orders for grocery, I keep missing half the items because of them being out of stock and I still got charged over $50 than the bill I received from target."
1308,The customer support were only somewhat helpful and in the end I lost about $10 when I tally all up.
1308,It feels like you are always overcharged for the bill you get apart from the service and the tips and this is not fair considering I'm already a member.
1308,..I've been using doordash SINCE the pandemic and I've had the same issue over and over.
1308,..I never write reviews but I've never been this frustrated with doordash for the degree of dishonesty I've dealt with over the years.
1308,I cannot hope for them to improve anymore.
1308,Absolutely terrible.
1338,I don't ever write reviews but I feel compelled to with doordash.
1338,"I'm also not one to order out often, since it allows more room for restaurants to mess up your order…."
1338,but how can you not when doordash offers a variety of good deals?
1338,"Whenever I see a promotion, I jump on it."
1338,I've paid as little as $2 for a meal that usually costs $25!
1338,"Sometimes they have 75% off coupons, a steal."
1338,"Anyways, it's worth the download, and worth the time writing this review."
1338,Now back to eating my Poke…
1153,Me and my girlfriend always have little date nights through door dash being we are doing a long distance relationship.
1153,"Now don't get me wrong, it's been okay."
1153,"Only little screw-ups like missing napkins, condiments, delivered one house down from our houses, ext."
1153,Tonight was different though.
1153,My food never even showed up and door dash only gave me half the money back for never getting the food I paid for.
1153,"I clicked the purchase order again, and it ordered 2 of the item that was never delivered."
1153,I payed for this item 3 times and now have one extra I didn't want.
1153,"All in the same date night, my girlfriend doesn't get her order either, and instead, gets an unseals McDonalds bag with a 10 piece nugget (with only 9 nuggets remaining) and a soda with no sticker seal on it."
1153,Absolutely disgusting.
1153,"It's embarrassing that my girlfriend was given that food for our ""date night""."
1153,It doesn't stop there.
1153,She puts a complaint and gets a free new delivery.
1153,This one is delivered two houses down from where she is.
1153,"My girlfriend being the kind soul she is says forget it and it's fine and let's it go with no new complaint because she doesn't want to be ""bothersome""."
299,"I choose to order from Grubhub above all other delivery options because their drivers (95% of the time) follow instructions, are courteous and respectful and pay attention to detail."
299,Task you!
1045,Fist of all bought out by Uber awhile ago so already a negative but that's not why.
1045,"If you are a regular on the app orders will get canceled for no reason, or they won't follow instructions and still refuse to issue a refund on the food."
1045,"..Here is what killed it for me, I spent $65 on an order that the food came rotten the instructions where not followed and when reached out to customer support the exact word said."
1045,"""Sorry but do to the fact you reached out regarding this order already I won't help you""."
1045,I will be reaching out to the BBB.
1156,Here's the deal!
1156,I use this app weekly and have been a monthly customer.
1156,But all that is changing as of today...This whole app is based off of people doing their job.
1156,My dasher didn't follow instructions.
1156,I got a message saying need substitutions.
1156,I entered them and minutes later it says order cancelled.
1156,The protocol is the dasher contacts you.
1156,Then they ask if you want a credit or a refund.
1156,I would have chosen credit bc I needed the cat food tonight and would have reordered.
1156,The dasher didn't follow protocol a second time.
1156,..So I had to reorder.
1156,When I did DoorDash informed me that refunds take 5-7 days to process.
1156,"Basically, then you are out the $30 bucks a second time for 5-7 days."
1156,"I talked to an agent, got transferred over 8 times."
1156,"Then 1 hour and 20 minutes later they gave me a credit for my waste of time, since I said I was leaving their app and no longer going to be a weekly user."
1156,"Therefore, I will use my $15 credit and cancel my monthly service."
1156,"Meanwhile my bank makes interest on my $30 bucks for a week, and I am out gas money."
1156,There goes the ease of using an app.
1156,Go with Uber eats instead!
476,I ordered lunch today.
476,"15 minutes into my 30 min lunch break(15 min after food was due to arrive) I got notice my order was cancelled due to a ""glitch' I would be refunded in 3-5 business days."
476,"So I have no lunch, no money and no time to figure out an alternative."
476,"And for the inconvenience I got a ""sorry'"
523,I ordered for pickup for nandos and my app autoset to another location 40 minutes away from me.
523,"I planned on picking up on my 30 minute lunch break to a location 5 minutes away, I got to the store and they didn't have my order."
523,That's when I realized it was to the wrong location.
523,"This has happened to me before where I tried picking up but it autoset to another location, it's definitely my fault for not double checking but when you're working all day and ready to get food you don't really think about worrying to see if it's the right location, especially since the place I go to is only 5 minutes away."
523,"On the phone call with customer service, I couldn't even hear the lady."
523,"It was so loud and rowdy that I couldn't make up on what she was saying, it sounded like a party and  then she had to put me on hold."
523,"So at the end of all that waiting, where I literally wasted 20 minutes trying to get a refund she flat out says we can cancel it but you'll be charged the full amount."
523,So basically don't place orders you can't pick up and double check the location otherwise Uber won't refund you!
523,Total waste of money and time.
795,I have used this app for years.
795,"Recently many of my orders will say that they are going to be delivered with in a time frame and I have to make my lunch hour accordingly, then they will go past my lunch break and I end up not having time to eat because it's never delivered on time."
795,This last order said it was ready and I went to pick up and the restaurant said it wasn't done yet and i proceeded to wait 30 mins and have to run back to work cause I was late from break.
795,Always an apology from customer services and never a solution.
795,..Will never use this app again
1264,I use DoorDash all the time it started while @ work when I would have a short lunch breaks but now I use it sometimes @ home too!
1264,If you use DD @ least twice a month or more you should get DashPass  IT'S DEFINITELY WORTH IT!
1264,"Pay annually to save even more money on fees, deliveries and DashPass dues."
1264,I'm on a first name basis with most of my local dashers lol but I must admit Ivan is the best he's a Rockstar!
1264,DD is always convenient and prompt.
1264,I've been using it for yrs and I've only had one issue and I use it 3 or 4 times a week sometimes.
1264,I love how it's designed to give you real time updates and info about your order and dasher.
1264,Thank you DD!
234,This was the first time we ordered from GrubHub and everything went smoothly..We have a year membership and we are hoping that GrubHub continues to receive a 5 Star Rating from us.
234,Keep up the good work.
285,I have only used GrubHub and their carriers twice so far.
285,And so far the two drivers their professionalism their speed have been a five star rating so as of now …I am truly impressed with Grubhub.
633,I used to like this app but the level of customer service when something goes wrong is horrible.
633,They told me they wouldn't give my money back and they hope I have a better experience next time when my driver didn't even deliver it to the right complex.
633,They offered me $2 when it was a $47 meal.
633,There won't be a next time.
633,I have had this happen on DoorDash where I didn't receive my food and they gave my my money back immediately plus credit.
633,I highly recommend using DoorDash over Uber eats.
633,It's insane how this many people have problems after reading your reviews and you haven't fixed your customer service.
633,Also why are the 5 star ratings all bad reviews?
633,It seems like something shady is going on here.
763,"The ability to take on more then one delivery needs to be removed, food ends up soggy or cold, every delivery should be a priority not a pay for option."
763,Would like a star rating instead of a thumbs up or thumbs down and the ability to type out my own reason for the rating.
763,The choices given for rating reason aren't always the reason.
763,Something that prompts the delivery driver to double check the address before drop off would be good too because apparently some drivers can't bother.
550,It's a fine service.
550,It works.
550,But what I hate about it is how it tries to obscure you from the true cost.
550,"First when you're adding items to a card, it only shows you the cart total."
550,"Then in the checkout, it actually shows you the cost with fees."
550,What's the point of showing me the cart total if that total has no bearing on what I  actually pay?
550,"Then, only after you finally completed the last step of the check out, do they ask you for the tip."
550,They base the tip on the entire order cost including all of their fees.
550,And then when you select the tip at no point do they show you what the total is with both your order and the tip...They try hard to make sure you don't actually realize the true cost.
550,Of course this is what all apps in the industry.
550,But I do find it very frustrating.
550,I wish they would be more upfront about the true cost.
1056,I paid for unlimited for months and my husband who doesn't have unlimited would add the same things to our basket and mine was always $20 more at any restaurant….
1056,"The restaurants charge your more for the same items if you have unlimited- for example adding rice cost me with unlimited $3.50 and my husband without unlimited $2.50.. overall my cart total would always be higher, taxes would be higher and I would overpay on top of paying them monthly.. complete SCAM and ripoff"
1185,My dasher never delivered my food I contacted him and gave him specific instructions to get to the house he said he called me multiple times and I tried to explain to him I'm sorry I was away from the phone and and asked him to tell me where he dropped my food at he never said where just around there bc I went outside and I didn't see the food went to my neighbors door and still didn't see the food I contacted support and the dasher nothing of help I really advise people to not use this app there willing to help until they don't want to there are multiple times when the place I'm ordering from messes up and I couldn't get my refund bc there's a limit that's honestly so stupid given that it wasn't my fault and there is an extra charge for things I pay for and I just want my money back support team and the dasher never gave me my food or money back it's honestly frustrating bc I don't have something to eat now please don't use this app and get scammed like I did and save your money.
8,Time and time again GrubHub disappoints me.
8,"I order food, leave clear written instructions about where I live and never select ""Contact free delivery"" because I know the app is going to navigate the driver somewhere else."
8,Why?!
8,I have no idea!!
8,There are a select few drivers who go above and beyond.
8,"If they can't find my residence, they call me, ask questions and eventually deliver my food."
8,I always tip the drivers because I appreciate them delivering my food.
8,"However, there are some drivers who don't even attempt to deliver my food, don't go above and beyond to make sure I get what I ordered and are either rude or don't answer my calls/texts after they've dropped off my food at the door but it's nowhere to be found."
8,"It is a waste of time, money and food ordering through GrubHub."
8,"Yes, my money gets refunded when I contact customer support."
8,What I'd like to know is why don't they update their apps navigation to prevent the drivers from not being able to find the home?
8,Why don't the drivers go out of their way to contact the customer?
8,Why don't the drivers respond to texts or calls?
8,It's beyond aggravating going through this time and time again.
8,I'm deleting this and going to use Uber Eats or Door Dash instead.
146,I ordered pizza which was delivered cold long after it was picked up by the driver.
146,The customer service rep offered me a $5 refund.
146,"I hate reheated pizza, so for me the entire order was ruined and I paid ten times what they offered me."
146,"When I continued to tell them their offer was unacceptable, they increased the amount in $2 increments three times."
146,They've lost me as a customer.
146,Door Dash delivers from the same place without making the customer wait an hour for cold food.
233,Just use Uber eats or door dash.
233,This app is not worth using period.
233,"It used to be fantastic, now it's a dumpster fire."
233,Food will be extremely late or not arrive at all.
233,"When this inevitably happens, getting your money back is next to impossible."
233,They bend over backwards to try to make YOU cancel the order so they can keep your money.
233,After 5 or so terrible customer service experiences I'm finally deleting this and never looking back.
280,The issue I have is that Duncan Donuts did not send me the order I asked for.
280,Otherwise I would've given 5 stars.
280,At Door Dash there's a way to report to the restaurant when they messed up the order.
294,Uber eats is horrible.
294,I've had them cancel orders after a hour of thinking it's on its way.
294,Had them forget items on my order .
294,Not yet with door dash fingers crossed.
333,"Tbh, Grubhub just doesn't compare to DoorDash, it's the same price for GH+ as DoorDash subscription, but less options and deals, and higher prices than door dash, also, I have yet to receive my order on time and not have it be delayed."
333,"I really wish I didn't miss my  renew sub date lol, but won't be subscribing for another month."
348,They already don't have the greatest selection of restaurants.
348,Their customer service blocked my chat feature.
348,They kept giving me the run around.
348,To be told no one was there to help me?
348,This was all over a $5 credit.
348,Don't waste your $$$ they don't even have chic fil a.
348,Use door dash Uber eats.
384,I can't count how many times I gone through to the app just to find that delivery is paused due to high demand every time I ended up using doordash I was only able to order about three times out of the several hundreds of times that I went to thier app just go through door dash they'll deliver for you
412,"6 dollar deal delivery fee, plus up-charge on dishes in general, plus service charge, plus tip."
412,Even more expensive than door dash and other delivery services.
412,A dish that would normally cost me $18 ended up costing $38.
412,Won't be using this app again.
493,"I'm not one to make a review but this app has been awful for me, delivery that get canceled, or keep getting delayed, my food comes cold 50 percent of the time and now I lost my favorite place because my address is to far now, honestly if you are gonna choose a app, use door dash way more reliable"
510,Received a promo for $30 off a grocery delivery.
510,I was curious to compare using the grocer's app.
510,"TLDR, Uber eats was more expensive than going through the grocers app even after the promo."
510,All the prices were about 30+ cents more expensive on Uber eats.
510,"I created the same delivery order in the grocery's app and the total after taxes and hidden ""fees"" (about $15 on Uber) came to $6 less compared to Uber eats and that included a 20% tip where the Uber eats total did not, so it would have been even more expensive."
510,Note there was no promo used on the grocer's app other than automatically applied coupons.
510,..The odd thing is I'm pretty sure the Grocer still goes through Uber eats for delivery.
510,Perhaps it's door dash.. Crazy how an order on Uber Eats with $30 in promo credits costed more for the same items BEFORE adding a tip.
510,"Additionally, this cost comparison would still hold true even if I got an Uber eats membership which would have saved an additional $7 unless I didn't tip on Uber eats for a total savings of $1 (which is lost to the membership fee)."
510,I'll go with the grocers app that also automatically applies various coupons and free pickup if desired.
510,"..The promo appears to be misleading and could trick customers who might not be aware of alternatives, so 2/5 for the deceptive practice."
545,My Uber Eats Driver was 5 min from my house (according to the app) when it was cancelled.
545,"I even texted her prior to her arrival to give specific landmarks, and description of the house WITH ALL THE LIGHTS ON."
545,I was cancelled about 30 seconds later.
545,.I have never been so disappointed in Uber Eats.
545,"The rain was NOT a factor, I was outside myself working and it was a light sprinkle."
545,".I expect a call, an email, anything to explain why my daughter had to wait an additional hour by ordering through DoorDash."
545,I was partial to Uber Eats and just signed up for the monthly charge for whatever promo y'all were offering.
545,I feel quite sure I will be cancelling.
545,That was ridiculous.
545,We had already been waiting over 40 min and for her to decide she didn't want to deliver seemed irrational.
545,I'm a surgical transplant nurse for a major hospital in FTW.
545,"Next time one of our surgeons or vendors wants to treat us to lunch, I'll vote Door Dash."
545,"It's a shame bc prior to this, Uber Eats would have been my vote."
545,I expect to see my refund in the AM considering it occurred PRIOR to the holiday and I paid $60+ for two entrees.
566,"One night after finishing dinner with my lovely queen, who is one of the best chefs I know, we both looked into each other's eyes and as we held hands our stomachs rumbled."
566,It was at moment my iphone email vibration rattled the romance of the circumstances.
566,"It was then I remembered I received a random coupon for 25 dollars off an order, from a wonderful company called door dash and suddenly all things made sense and I told myself not only was I going to give 5 stars if asked for my review but I would also do what I've never done and that was write a review."
566,Because these out reaches aren't the first time and even as I've used your service more in the past it's nice to be appreciated as a customer.
566,Thank you ..A hungry Uber Eats user
600,I'm happy to pay extra for food to be delivered but Uber Eats prices have gotten ridiculous.
600,Ever since they bought Door Dash they've figured that they own enough of the market they can price gouge us.
600,The sad part is the driver gets a tiny percentage.
600,Also the prices are higher than at the restaurant yet the restaurant actually gets paid less when someone uses Uber Eats.
600,Google how much their drivers make and what amount the restaurants get paid and compare it to what you pay.
600,"I'll be using other services or picking up my food until Uber eats pays their drivers fairly, the small businesses get a fair cut, and they stop price gouging consumers at the same time."
600,Go to specific restaurants websites/app and see if you can order.
600,You'll save money plus the small business and the driver will make more!
679,Restaurants routinely join and leave this app.
679,It says restaurants can't deliver to my address that Door Dash and other always deliver to.
679,"The standard delivery time says 30-45min but is consistently ~1.5 hours or more long (therefore always late, and I can't use this app if I have a client meeting right after lunch because it won't come on time or will be cold)."
679,If the order is wrong Uber Eats' customer service has the nerve to yell at YOU for requesting a refund.
679,"..So to sum it up: horrible customer service, routinely late, crappy app."
679,I only use Uber Eats because my company gives me a monthly allowance on it for remote work.
679,The rest of the month I happily use Door Dash.
683,Compared to door dash it's like getting a five star restaurant to a a 2 even if you order to the same restaurant.
683,"Other companies forget your sauces, half your order and provide a credit without even talking to you, I don't want sweet and sour chicken without the swerve n sour and a credit for $2.00 off the $10 sweet n sour chicken doesn't make it right..Then you can go to the chat room, wait 30 minutes to get literally cussed out by the overworked twenty something unprofessionally handling the situation."
691,I appreciate the convenience and am willing to pay and tip well but explain to me why they food or drinks have an increase in price when ordered through the app (Uber eats or door dash) plus the deliver fee of 2 or more dollars plus the tip.
691,"..So Uber Eats, how much money are you making?"
691,Does the restaurant I am ordering from see the profits of the dollar or more increase on the product or is that your profit?..This has caused me to change my mind and not use these platform.
691,I'm going to put my money in the restaurants so they are still here for us to enjoy instead of bankrupt from this corruption.
721,This was the last time I use UBER EATS.
721,The app platform has apparently been modified to discourage any of their users to complain about an order.
721,"On several occasions, they have automatically entered a tip when none was given due to poor service, eg dropped out front before anyone could get there and the food was taken (live in an urban setting)."
721,"On attempting to view the receipt, you are informed to look at in 24 hours, apparently assuming correctly that most people won't come back to it."
721,"Lastly, they will not allow you to use the microphone on your phone so you have to type everything out.. Maybe Door Dash or another app provider is better- I guess I'll find out."
721,Done with UBER
759,On multiple occasions my order has not been delivered to my house.
759,The first time Uber refunded me.
759,"The next time, Uber said they couldn't do anything about it and I was left with a expensive bill and no food."
759,I wrote extremely specific directions in my profile detailing how to get to my house (which is very easy to find) and STILL they deliver to the wrong address and refuse to refund me.
759,To make matters worse I have newborn twins and cannot walk around the neighborhood at all hours trying to find my food and it's extremely important that I eat.
759,"The company, on every occasion, has treated me we zero respect."
759,Save your money and use door dash.
811,"Used to be a great food delivery app and the main one I used, completely has gone downhill."
811,"My order was picked up 10 min after my order was supposed to arrive so almost hour later after it should have been delivered, in addition to it being second in line to being delivered after it was picked up."
811,"Recently, most of my orders have been delayed and later than anticipated delivery time."
811,It's becoming a thing for the app to delay the delivery time.
811,Recently have been using Door Dash and it's been great!
811,Even got a delivery in under 25 minutes.
811,Would highly recommend Door Dash.
816,Almost every single time I order on my acct or my boyfriends acct there is almost always an error or a mixup or a completely wrong order.
816,And if you complain about your mix ups more than once or twice they will not fix the next messed up order.
816,My kid has the flu and all she wanted to eat after not eating for three days is kfc mashed potatoes and a Baja blast drink.
816,I ordered that and stuff for me and her father.
816,Only her stuff was missing and they wont give me a refund or resend it so I have to spent another $20 with fees and tip to get a simple mashed potatoes.
816,I hate this app and door dash is much better
818,We don't use Uber Eats very often.
818,I normally use Door Dash which works great.
818,Over years with Door Dash we have only had a couple of issues.
818,"This time our food was bad, the delivery was awful, and I ended up getting food poisoning."
818,Uber Eats would not help with the issue because the few times I have used them I have had problems.
818,That is a reflection of Uber East not me.
818,If they don't want to adjust the price that's fine I'm not super worried about it.
818,But their customer service is bad all around.
818,I should have known better and just used Door Dash.
825,I spend over $1000 on Uber eats per month.
825,Every order my food has been taking longer and longer to arrive.
825,They switch drivers several times.
825,"Today, I asked them to cancel.My order (after paying extra for priority)."
825,They instead closed the chat on my face and gave me Uber cash.
825,I am DONE with this app.
825,We should all just go to restaurants for pickup (and save money) instead of supporting this unethical tech giant.
825,"I'll be doing that going forward and when I absolutely can't make it to a restaurant, I'll be using door dash or anyone other than Uber!"
872,I wish I could give 0 stars but alas.
872,Our driver left almost $50 of our meal at a restaurant (which the restaurant confirmed) and Uber would not send back the driver or refund the money.
872,I complained over 48 hours and they refused to do anything.
872,I also had tipped the driver quite well not knowing half of our meal was missing.
872,..There are many food delivery services; please use one that cares about their customers because Uber eats does not.
872,Door dash is a much better option as are there customer service reps.
899,Save yourself the hassle either use door dash or go to the store yourself.
899,"One they mark up all the prices, second I've had multiple occasions where they refuse a refund for driver errors."
899,Destroyed food and or non-delivered food.
899,This is all with proof this is happening and they will refuse you a refund after it happens once and they refund you.
899,Mind you that's been 90% of my experience with this app.
899,The drivers will often mark delivered and drive off with your order if you live in downtown and they don't feel like finding parking.
913,Some of the restaurants allow you to order from them and then cancel your order.
913,Uber doesn't hold them accountable so the experience becomes frustrating and bad for the drivers.
913,This is why Door Dash is winning 8 out of 10 times.
913,Customers should be aware that restaurants have stipulations before ordering and UberEats should hold them to terms and conditions.
913,What's the point of being on a major platform if you can't place high volume orders?
913,?
930,Ordered through Uber eats had an entire $10 item missing called the restaurant they won't fix it reached out to Uber they straight up told me they won't refund the item I've never had an issue like this with door dash I even sent a pic to them it took way too long for a response and all they say is leave a bad review for the restaurant…worst customer service ever I use Uber all the time too it's crazy they just lost a customer over a $10 item…door dash it is they actually fix mistakes
1004,I have used Uber Eats for many years and now I am at my wits end.
1004,I am being charged a service fee higher than even the taxes.
1004,And when I place orders my food ends up arriving cold because it takes so long to find a driver.
1004,"The app ends up saying things like ""oops, looks like we'll need to find a new driver,"" which is ridiculous because by the time they find one I could have gone and picked my food up myself and have already ate it."
1004,"I will no longer be using Uber Eats, time to switch to Door Dash."
1071,"My main issue is without fail- Uber eats, door dash, and other all fail to find me every time."
1071,Only Postmates people do.
1071,It's the apps fault as far as I can tell.
1071,"They deny it, but it's beyond coincidence by now."
1071,Their gps is just not good.
1071,So when I want Postmates half the time they will joint venture with another service.
1071,And it's a nightmare.
1071,Awful
1119,Person never dropped off food and toke a black photo.
1119,Never answered me either.
1119,Thankfully door dash gave us back our money but not to our bank account but as credit on their app.
1119,For the first time ordering I can say it definitely was a sucky experience!
1119,But I like their quick response.
1119,Our door also has light and cameras.
1119,Unfortunately the next driver placed the bag of food so close to the door that I couldn't open it without it rolling down the steps and she seen me (the passenger) struggle and still drove off.
1119,She literally could of got out and helped but I guess she waited for me to say help when I looked up to say help she already was driving away.
1119,"Tho I would of not waited for someone to say help and offered it, I still feel this was a better driver than the OTM which I found out means ""On The Move"" meaning someone making moves being sneaky and they sure was and got away with it."
1119,Other than those two experiences I'm ok with giving the app another try.
1119,I'm in Philly PA so people out here going to try to take advantage the best way they know how and think they entitled to it smh I just wish there was a way to protect us from people like this who they hire..
1119,I'm ordering again today so let's see what happens now…
1125,Honestly used to love DoorDash.
1125,I'm going to give it a 2 because it was recently at a 1.
1125,The only reason for that is 1 star for the restaurants because they always make the food on point and it's usually never them.
1125,The second star is because Door Dash used to be good.
1125,But what in the world has been going on with the past deliveries.
1125,.Every delivery that I have placed in the past 2-3 months has been so terrible and it's been about 6 times.
1125,This is definitely my last as I'm currently waiting AGAIN for more than 1 hour for my food all because of other deliveries.
1125,.What's the point of ordering food and calling yourself door dash if you aren't going to be either of those things?
1125,.The food has been taking at least 2 hours every time to be delivered.
1125,The longest I've waited was 2 hours and 45 minutes!!!
1125,.I'm not sure if it's the drivers or door dash but I do not want to return as a customer because this is simply ridiculous.
1125,They pass right by your house.
1125,"It's not even like they go to a spot down the block, you see them jumping on high way and are stuck where it is they probably have went."
1125,"Oh and then when you ask, half the time they never respond."
1125,There has to be a better algorithm or your going to lose your customers!!!
1125,"If I wanted to wait 3 hours for food, I can go walk and pick it up!"
1131,This service is sometimes terrible and the company just doesn't care.
1131,I ordered from a local restaurant tonight.
1131,"After having my delivery time moved later and later for 45 minutes with no response from my driver, I inquired with a live Door Dash customer service rep as to the whereabouts of my order."
1131,"While they were giving me a bunch or corporate speak about how they take food freshness and temperature so seriously, the dasher texted me to say that they were given a second delivery from the same restaurant that was taking longer than mine."
1131,I mean the restaurant is 15 minutes away.
1131,They could have delivered and returned to the restaurant easily enough.
1131,"While I appreciated the response from the dasher, it was completely opposite everything the customer service rep was telling me."
1131,"When I let the customer service rep know that the dasher contradicted them, they immediately ended and deleted the thread."
1131,About 10 minutes later the dasher brought my food with an apology.
1131,The food was 45 minutes old…not good.
1131,Honestly I've had both good and bad experiences but you should know that there will be times they ruin your evening and they really don't care.
1131,I'm sure they have a well crafted response to posts like this but they just don't really care about the customer or your experience.
1152,I think Door Dash should switch some things around.
1152,The first thing they should do is switch the order of the process.
1152,I think the restaurant AND dasher should accept your order before it's prepared.
1152,The second thing they should do is allow you to switch your order from delivery to pick up if it's taking too long or if the order hasn't been accepted by a dasher.
1152,"..For example, I ordered breakfast from a place about 15 minutes from my house."
1152,Door Dash accepted the order and I got a notification that it was being made.
1152,45 minutes went by before a dasher even accepted my order.
1152,Then I had to wait for them to arrive.
1152,I was already aware I was taking a risk by ordering a hot drink with whipped cream but was disappointed knowing that it sat 45 minutes and was going to be a flop regardless.
1152,My food was cold and subpar.
1152,"While waiting, I looked through the app to see if I could switch it to pick up since it had been so long and no one accepted the order yet but couldn't find that option."
1152,I would have been better off picking it up.
1157,Should be 0 stars.
1157,I placed an order and didn't receive my food.
1157,Door Dash CS said they couldn't credit my account since I used the restaurant app.
1157,The restaurant told me the same so I was without my money and my lunch.
1157,3 of their dashers were in the restaurant but the restaurant manager stated they told him the order was canceled so they wouldn't take it.
1157,My app showed 3 different dashers were on their way.
1157,"I spoke to DoorDash CS twice and requested a manager and was told one would call me, but if course no one called."
1157,Both times I was put on hold only to be told my order was on the way.
1157,When I told them no one was bringing the order they didn't care to help or give a resolution for their mistake.
1157,2 1/2 hours later the restaurant credited my account and still no call from DoorDash.
1157,This was the second time I didn't get my order from DoorDash and didn't get help so I decided to write a review.
1157,"They are unorganized and the CS is worthless in giving any resolution to a serious issue…money out of my account and nothing to show for it, you're just left with an ‘oh well' attitude that their customers are ripped off."
1169,Wish I could give 0 stars.
1169,I have had basically every order wrong since using this platform.
1169,"At the beginning, they give a credit."
1169,But it's never actually even close to the original purchase amount.
1169,"$3, here maybe $6 there."
1169,..Then I had literally back to back orders wrong.
1169,"And when I say wrong, I mean COMPLETELY missing items."
1169,"Even one time, there was complete proof because the delivery driver messaged that the place was out of what I ordered."
1169,Door dash refused to ‘compensate'.
1169,I never asked for any extra just the money I had spent on items I didn't ever get.
1169,I am furious that I have over $30 + wasted on items I never even got.
1169,"..When you contact support, the first message always seems like they will be so helpful but it's downhill from there."
1169,"They are rude, unhelpful, and sometimes just completely end the conversation by disconnecting."
1169,They always say they will follow up through email and then never do.
1169,I will never use doordash again.
1169,Never.
1169,"At this point, it's theft."
1169,They have stolen from me.
1169,Money that I work hard for.
1169,It's ridiculous.
1172,"I've been using door dash for a while now and I've also had multiple problems with it, I've tried to cancel and get my money back instead of credits because I do not want that."
1172,I wanted a full refund and even contacted multiple people that worked for (Door dash) I was told I'd get my money back in a couple of days I've been waiting for almost about a week!
1172,"This is really irritating.. my little sister got a refund on her stuff and she got the money back the next day, but me I'm still waiting."
1172,Like I already informed I called about four times and got the same lady telling me I will not get my money back.
1172,Door dash as much money some of us spent and worked hard for the money.
1172,An buy/ purchase stuff or even give money to people that are working too.
1172,I don't find it fair when i contact someone for a refund I can't get it back knowing I worked for the money!
1172,Do better (Door dash) and the rude people that work there and never would like to help and do they job they got.
1204,This company is horrible.
1204,"First, some of the drivers are bad."
1204,Just bad.
1204,There has been more than one occasion where I ordered food and the driver never delivered it and I called the company and they offered no refund.
1204,I called the restaurant but they said the dasher had picked up the food so they understandably couldn't do anything.
1204,Other times the restaurant got my orders completely wrong.
1204,"I specifically Star on all my orders if you are out of something or can't make my order, don't substitute, call me or at the very least cancel the order."
1204,The restaurant did neither and doordash didn't give me a refund.
1204,They didn't even give me credit.
1204,And because I have been very ill in 2022 I haven't been able to leave home a lot this year so I depended on services like this a LOT.
1204,They treat they handicapped like crap...One time I ordered alcohol and a driver left it on the street.
1204,In California.
1204,Which is against the law.
1204,I called Door Dash to complain.
1204,They didn't care.
1212,Door dash has been AWFUL!!
1212,"At first they, they were amazing."
1212,I only had an issue here or there and always opted for credits instead of asking for my money back and they handled it really well the couple times something did happen.
1212,I spent SO much money ordering from door dash minimum 2-5 times a week every single week.
1212,..The last month or two I have had an issue with almost every single order I've made.
1212,"It started literally taking 2 hours for my food to get to my house and 3 times, the app was showing that my dasher was close by for 2 hours but after I contacted support I found out the dasher never picked up my order and since it was so late at night, I couldn't order anything else and they wouldn't give me a refund."
1212,I've had at least 5 issues just like that since then and they handled it so poorly.
1212,"For as much money as I spent with them, I'm so disappointed with how they decide to repay loyalty."
1235,The title says it all.
1235,"I don't know how many times this service has left me hanging in Salt Lake waiting for food that's cold, missing items or just doesn't show up at all."
1235,Usually it's a super long extended wait past the estimated time plus one of those other problems.
1235,They offer a fraction of compensation of what missing items cost.
1235,Even when a whole meal is missing from delivery or wrong they will try to give you a base refund taking 5-7 business days while you're out of luck on feeding your family and everything else is closing.
1235,Most of it is the garbage quality of delivery drivers probably due to garbage pay despite the fact door dash emphasizes tips for better service.
1235,This is garbage I wish I had every penny back I've spent that DD made at this point.
1235,.I'm probably 30 bad delivery's deep and fully deleting this garbage.
1254,I know I don't need to do this many reviews but it beats trying to explain myself like 7 times .
1254,I just deleted this app .
1254,The rep never fixed my issue .
1254,I was simply going to order a pizza and cheese sticks from Pizza Hut .
1254,Your app was going to charge me nearly 50 dollars .
1254,I went to that resteraunt and ordered the very same thing and got it for less than 30 .
1254,They even said wow to that price .
1254,I don't want anymore emails from y'all .
1254,The rep still hasn't fixed the problem.
1254,I'm just done with door dash .
1254,I will go get the food myself and using the example I just gave save 20 dollars in fees for a store that is like 20 miles from me.
1254,Don't let them lie to you they found my number when they ended the chat because I didn't provide it .
1254,They don't need the number or email just to answer that one question.
1266,"So I have been using door dash for years and generally, everything is really good."
1266,But I wanted to warn people DO NOT USE EXPRESS for your order.
1266,I don't know if this is with everyone but I stay in an apartment and every time I tried to use express delivery they get lost.
1266,And every time they call me and I have to come downstairs to meet them to get my food.
1266,I never have any problems with standard delivery.
1266,They find the place every time.
1266,Could be just people starting out or something for the express delivery?
1266,I don't know.
1266,Just stick to regular delivery for stuff.
1266,Other than that.
1266,It's a good app and I get my food on time.
1274,Grocery stores are bugged.
1274,"I can only order from food places with small menus but with places that have a large menu/more items to load the app crashes and gets stuck on the loading animation and eventually freezes(animation and no touch control) Restarting, redownloading, different devices(I've tried 3 apple devices) or different profiles do not fix this issue."
1274,"As an app developer I know these things can happen and hope this review gets seen and fixed because this error makes me use Uber eats instead when I originally just use door dash, y'all are losing my service so please fix this!"
1274,I'm sure it's not just me as my gf has the same issue and she completely deleted the app and exclusively uses Uber eats now
1281,I scheduled ahead of time a delivery of pizzas for a party we had planned and after the time the pizza should have arrived I received a call from door dash customer service telling me that my order would need to be canceled because it couldn't be fullfilled but I could try reordering the same order again (which wouldve taken up to 2 hours to fulfill).
1281,The customer service person actually hung up on me when I inquired why I would reorder with no garuntee that it'd be fulfilled.
1281,I have never left a bad review before but this isn't the first problem I've encountered with door dash nor the first time I've been hung up on by them.
1281,I will not be renewing my membership and I suggest you look at other options for your food delivery service.
1281,This company is horrible.
1290,I love Door Dash.
1290,I really do.
1290,"But when you click on a restaurant to look at their offerings, and then go back to the main list, ultimately the whole app refreshes and brings you to the top of the page."
1290,It's ***incredibly*** frustrating to then have to scroll back down to where you were.
1290,"Often times, after this happening a couple times, I switch to UberEats and buy through them."
1290,"I get that maybe a restaurant or two has gone offline in that time and they're reflecting that change, but why not just keep those restaurants on the page and reflect that they're closed until the user refreshes the page."
1292,If you dasher spills your drink good luck getting a replacement.
1292,"The driver was amazing and super nice, accidents happen."
1292,However I still wanted my drink and since I paid for it I just wanted to get it redelivered.
1292,They refused and told me they would give me the cost of the drink to reorder.
1292,What about the tax I'll have to pay?
1292,The delivery fee I'll pay because I don't meet the $12 minimum?
1292,What about the tip for the driver?
1292,"""It's not necessary for you to tip on the orders"" … excuse me?"
1292,People do this for a living… I'm going to tip for someone taking time out of their day and using their gas to come and bring me a drink when I can't physically get around well or I'm very sick.
1292,Do better door dash.
1292,My subscription is canceled and I won't be using for a very long time.
1297,Companies that partner with door dash should do better about providing quality and acceptable packaging for delivery orders to ensure the customer's food isn't tampered with.
1297,Door dash should include this in their policies if company's wish to partner with doordash to extend their services through delivery.
1297,Some places use brown packaging bags that are sealed with a sticker and stapled to ensure the food is not tampered with yet some places only place the food within a plastic bag with no stability and double tie the bag as if the dasher cannot untie the knot and tamper with the contents.
1297,This should be heavily considered by the higher ups at door dash more so from a public health and safety standpoint to ensure more quality services is being provided for users of their services.
1298,Of all the food delivery services door dash is truthfully the best one you can get.
1298,"It has the best stores, the best customer service, and it does grocery items."
1298,"Even the paid pass is worth it, especially if you order from the grocery a lot."
1298,There is not a better option than door dash.
1298,It's the Swiss Army knife of these apps.
1298,Easy to use and decent prices.
1298,"..Came back to update my review, I'm continuing to love the app!!!"
1298,It is truely the best food delivery service you can get.
1298,10/10 this app gets it right.
1298,I can't recommend it enough
1301,Door dash was very reliable at first but for the last couple orders it's been awful.
1301,My first order was for a wing place and I typed my order in and made sure everything was right opened it to check 99% of my food I had on there was gone and it was already here before I found out so at delivery I got one thing I order potato wedges and nothing else.
1301,Then again today I received the wrong order again.
1301,"Something is going on I didn't even receive what was on my receipt, was some other persons food."
1301,Yes Ik sounds bad ordering it like that but I'm 17 and not allowed to really cook a lot of things and my moms out of town on a weekend vacation.
1301,It's very unbecoming bc every experience before was absolutely wonderful whys it going bad now.
1309,"I ordered KFC while I was staying in Connecticut with my fiancé seeing her family, it was a long day and nobody wanted to cook so I ordered food."
1309,"The process of buying it online with door dash was easy, what ruined it for me is at some point from ordering the food and receiving it, it got spilled every where in the bag."
1309,"Im talking gravy and potatoes opened up and made everything a mess including the chicken, kinda made it all far less appetizing."
1309,Like imagine putting your entire meal in a bucket and putting it in one of the paint mixers that shakes it to ensure it's well mixed.
1309,Well my food was well mixed when it arrived I took a picture of it and sent it to them and they didn't do much to make up for it.
1309,Bare minimum type of service.
1316,Update:  this service getting worse while also getting even more expensive.
1316,"Menus have shrunk, ads are annoying when you just want to order some dam food."
1316,Everything is way more expensive than at the place then ad all the fees.
1316,Not worth it anymore.
1316,Nickeled and dimed to death and the long fall of the stock price reflects I am not the only ditching door dash.
1316,..Service fee plus monthly fee plus city fee plus tip all on top of the order.
1316,Comes out to about $10 for delivery.
1316,Promos were worth it but now even those are not really a discount.
1316,"3 dollars off an order for ordering 2 coke products that add up to 6 dollars is not a discount, it is an upsell."
1316,Don't play me for a sucker.
1318,"Worked a 12 hour shift, was very tired so I decided to order from door dash so I wouldn't have to drive,  ordered to only find out it was for pick up after I double clicked to pay for order using Apple Pay."
1318,Within a second it said the restaurant was preparing my order.
1318,"I hit the help button to cancel my order and the app stated that I could cancel my order but I could not get a refund due to the store ""already preparing my order""."
1318,Within seconds of trying to cancel my order the door dash producers did not allow me to refund my order.
1318,I had to drive there because I would lose 29$ and wouldn't get any food either.
1318,"It's sad that this app allows this, very greedy on behalf of door dash 👎🏼👎🏼"
1319,"DoorDash has made me so mad multiple times, my order is always being cancelled and it takes the longest for the money to reflect back in my card!"
1319,"The Dasher is always getting lost with my order and when they call me on my mobile device, they are telling me their like miles away from my location and it made me so upset because I had to get out of my house, get in my car, and drive many miles away from my home to where the door dasher was so I can get my order!"
1319,The whole entire purpose of me getting my food delivered to my house was because I didn't want to leave my house!
1319,And I will no longer order from DoorDash again!
1319,Waitr is much better and they always get my order on time and they never cancel my order!
1323,I've been using Door Dash for quite some time without issue.
1323,"I travel a lot, and use it exclusively if available in that particular area."
1323,I ordered a steak dinner in Temple TX one night.
1323,It never showed.
1323,I made multiple attempts through the app to submit a no-show report.
1323,Nothing happened.
1323,Zero communication from door dasher driver.
1323,No help from Door Dash.
1323,Eventually called and finally talked to a human later in the week.
1323,She politely said she cannot help me and that it was peculiar that there was no picture taken or notes from dasher.
1323,Guess I'm out the $50 bucks and inflated tip.
1323,Got to work and found out that a lot of co-workers were having the same issue.
1323,"It's a great concept, but there's apparently no resolution if your food doesn't show."
1331,I never leave reviews on apps.
1331,I switched to door dash because i was having issues with uber eats and thought i'd give it a try.
1331,i have had a few recent issue with my orders—like items not arriving that i reported.
1331,No issue arose.
1331,"then a meal completely didn't show up ~60$ paid and i reported it and they stated they can't refund because they don't have to ""it's stated in the fine print""."
1331,"Because i had reported ""too many issues recently"" (not to any fault of my own) they will not issue a refund."
1331,..basically theft for no service .
1331,im shocked.
1331,ordering with no guarantees of food but definitely guarantee of spending monday.
1331,despite the set backs i had with uber eats they always made sure they addressed issues that arose.
1334,"I've used Door Dash for years in college, but recently it seems every order I have is missing at least one item."
1334,"This might not be an issue for people who have endless time, because that's what you need to get through their gauntlet of employees all telling you the same few lines of how sorry they are."
1334,"Honestly, I've discovered it's best to just accept whatever automated deal they offer because that's all their going to give even after a 2 hour text conversation."
1334,..Not to mention they did NOTHING when I was verbally harassed by one of their drivers.
1334,I'm sure he's still out driving and threatening even more customers.
1334,"..If you have this app, uninstall it."
1334,"If you're considering getting it, don't."
1340,If I could give them zero stars I would!
1340,I placed a big order today through the restaurant online delivery service and when I received my food and opened my containers the delivery driver put it upon himself to eat my food and leave the scraps in the containers and still delivered it to me and took my tips.
1340,I contacted the restaurant first and then contacted door dash and the door dash customer service department said that he would put a ticket in with the restaurant to refund my money which right there I have an issue with because it wasn't the restaurant's fault that door dash delivery guy DeRon W. Of Indianapolis Indiana decided to eat my food and he said well we will put it in for him to never deliver to your address again HE SHOULDNT EVEN BE DELIVERING TO ANYONES ADDRESS
102,"What grubhub has done has destroyed the restaurant business, they've choked restaurants for a high percentage of their profits - they're left with no choice but to work through grubhub to survive  ..They dont pay their delivery workers enough and instead put the social pressure on the customer to pay the wage of their workers."
102,A disgusting corporate tactic becoming more and more the norm.
102,"..Companies like this work because in the beginning everything is so convenient and inexpensive, then, once they have everyone hooked on their system, they raise the service fees, they add another hidden fee, they rip the rug right out from under you and now were paying 15$ in fees BEFORE even tipping the only person actually doing the work, the driver, who makes next to nothing."
102,"..I use it now, but the moment there is a more ethical and customer friendly company grubhub will never see another dollar from me."
102,I look forward to it
587,I've been having them for years.
587,My husband even worked for them during the pandemic and it is ridiculous the amount of times we've had to reach customer support for issues of all kinds.
587,".My food takes hours to arrive, once it arrives I discover the driver stuck their hands in there , sometimes they over schedule pick ups."
587,They pay zero to no attention to the time frames they provide.
587,Many hidden fees.
587,I get all kinds of notifications saying I'll get this or that discount / offer / special etc.
587,All to end up paying the exact same.
587,".Today I reached out to try to see if they wanted to redeem themselves for all the trouble I've gone through for years, and they said it wasn't  approved."
587,"Ok, bye!"
587,Never ever using this service again.
587,.There are more companies to order food from.
587,I have no need to stay loyal.
33,As a person that works in the kitchen at a restaurant- I know first hand that when items are missing- it's not a driver issue - it's a restaurant issue.
33,Some restaurants / fast food places will close up the bags so the driver don't get access and that's for food safety.
33,If you are missing items from an order call the place you ordered from.
33,They are responsible for getting the order correct NOT delivery drivers!!
33,.I'm so grateful that we see some of the best drivers who take their job seriously.
33,If they can double check orders they will but ultimately it's the responsibility of the place you ordered from!
33,!.Thank you GrubHub for providing a great service!
33,!
220,Be careful… Grubhub is NOT reliable.
220,"It seems like the delivery drivers are NOT trained to double check ""orders."""
220,They simply  pick up without confirming they have everything.
220,"..What's worse is that once you claim that food is missing on the Grubhub help service, all they do is say ""sorry and refund you."""
220,They miss the whole point of the inconvenience they have caused and the reason why we ordered delivery for a reason!!
220,They're ridiculous!
220,!
751,Delivery Drivers are usually very nice and mostly faster than the time frame listed.
751,The company itself can improve upon making sure the orders are correct before leaving the stores and restaurants.
751,Almost 50% of my orders had something missing that either the driver forgot to check for or the store didn't have the proper order complete.
751,"Not the driver's fault at all as they seem to be excellent, just looks bad on the company to have to give refunds for things that could be solved by just double checking the orders."
927,We received an increase in daily Ubereats orders.
927,We contacted Ubereats to confirm they were verifying these transactions before we fulfilled them.
927,"UE said yes orders are verified, these are UE customers and to please fulfill orders."
927,"..-We don't have access to customer info to double check, so we fulfilled orders...The driver upon delivery is supposed to verify customer name and age before hand off."
927,"If there's a discrepancy, the item is supposed to be returned to the store at the customers expense...We eventually process $3500 in orders of high end items."
927,Uber subsequently contacts us days later to inform us our account is closed and we won't be receiving payments due to fraud...I tried to dispute it and got locked in a spiral of automated email responses and customer service reps that direct you to the email which generates an automatic denial response...User beware
612,"I used to order five days a week if not more, and had the Uber one subscription - Until I  got a very low quality delivery from the place where are used to order all the time."
612,"When I brought this up to the company, they pretty much rejected my complaint, and I had to keep on pressing the issue for them to see that I was a regular customer and I never had any issues with previous orders and for them to do something about it."
612,Since then I have not use the service because I don't wanna be stuck with the situation where I'm paying a lot of money for low quality food and service.
612,I was always a fan of the concept and service.
612,This experience kinda killed the desire to use the service in the future.
1296,Disappointed in the new changes to their delivery system.
1296,I used to be able to rely on a timely delivery and the food was always warm and fresh.
1296,"Recently, Doordash has updated how they do deliveries and they will have a dasher do multiple stops and don't come  straight to me."
1296,"Now, instead of the estimated 20-30 minute delivery, I will about 1 hour before I get my food."
1296,It's very frustrating because my food is cold/soggy.
1296,"Unless I add the extra fee to have it come straight to me, I have to wait for low quality food that I could've gotten myself in a shorter time."
1296,"As a loyal customer for 4 years, I'm very disappointed in the new way they are running their business and will no longer be using their app."
249,I placed an order for one hamburger and a soda to drink from a hamburger restaurant.
249,"First, my order took an HOUR."
249,"Then, my order was assigned to two different drivers."
249,"Lastly, 5 mins before my delivery was due, I get a call and email saying my order was cancelled, which wasn't my doing."
249,"Then when I called GrubHub customer support, I was only offered a $5 credit towards my next order."
249,Completely ridiculous.
529,"This year, my husband threw me a surprise birthday party - we ordered a meal thru the app- it went thru but the progress bar was stuck for over 2 hours on the ""restaurant is preparing your food"" there was even a driver assigned to it - then the order was abruptly cancelled with no explanation - just the usual -we are sorry for your inconvenience- here's a $5 credit towards your next meal- which you may or may not get - .So here we were - no food - not enough money to order again - the credit back was slow to appear - since apparently .I DMed them and posted on social media - they responded quickly - but only made things worse with that meaningless - ""We're sorry we ruined your evening- here's $5 - go away"" then they just stopped responding .Later I found out that the restaurant was closed that day -Uber eats stopped responding - .Sorry but a $5 credit is not going to cut it here - they do not take any responsibility for their own errors - and you get no response - other than a canned reply  - I deleted the app"
1279,The food is excellent and delivered fast *for a large fee*.
1279,They will send your favorite foods to your house *at their own prices*.
1279,"Their prices are higher than the restaurants, but if you sign up for their promotion then you can have it delivered for FREE *kinda* don't forget the extra driver charge, and don't forget to add the express option to insure your driver doesn't take your food on a wild 30 minute ride."
1279,Oh yea and if your order gets messed up they'll totally reimburse you!
1279,"* but not really* did your 15 waffle not come with everything like utensils butter or syrup, that's okay they'll give you a 1.10 credit towards your next rip off session."
1279,"Did you accidentally order your food to a different state, don't worry they'll warn you that it seems like you're far away."
1279,*sometimes*
663,Never really had an issue with the Uber/Uber eats app itself but my main issue is the number of push notifications they send through.
663,"I've never once seen an ad for some promo and found it important or worthwhile, but I have considered fully deleting the app after getting 5-10 push notifications like that in a day."
663,..You have to HUNT to find the settings to turn them off and they always somehow mysteriously turn back on after a month or two.
663,Please consider being more thoughtful in your push notifications to customers and stop bombarding with nonsense.
694,I been using Uber just because I have little kids with no help.
694,Never fails to give me the worst experience.
694,"Order always takes longer and the food gets here cold, bad shape, missing items because drivers don't take a second to make sure everything is ok."
694,"Adding to that, drivers take multiple pick ups!"
694,Customer service is the worse ever!
694,Refunds un most cases I don't get back.
694,You pay a lot of money for a service that don't have nothing to do with you after something's goes wrong.
694,Drivers are crap amd don't care how much you spent they just want to make as much deliveries possible to make money and they expect a tip on top of that.
694,"Delivering cold, damage, and missing items for you."
725,This used to be a good quality delivery service that at least got your order delivered within an hour of the estimated delivery time.
725,"Now if it does show up, it is two hours late and the food is not edible."
725,"You can watch your order and see it get picked up then sit in the delivery drivers car for an extra hour while more pick ups and deliveries are made… keep in mind, this is after you have paid for direct delivery."
725,I have deleted the app after the fourth time in a row of dealing with this issue.
725,Uber does not refund or even believe you when you contact them.
725,Find a better delivery service and let this company die off.
725,Plus they treat their drivers horribly.
1022,It's very frustrating that they don't reshuffle drivers if an order is taking longer than expected.
1022,The driver will often pick up multiple orders before then delivering them to each person.
1022,"It means that if one order is being, everyone is also delayed."
1022,"Now instead of having 1 upset person because of the food delay, you now have multiple people upset."
1022,The app should reprioritize orders and reassign them.
1022,This affects the quality of food which is delivered because of multiple pick ups and multiple deliveries.
1022,Ugh.
1161,I just downloaded DoorDash and began using it a couple of weeks ago.
1161,My first experience was abysmal.
1161,The DoorDash took my food for herself and claimed to have given it to a valet.
1161,"Only thing is, my building does not have VALET."
1161,"Then when I asked her to come back to show me who, she claimed to be far out of the area… it was only one minute after..You guys did re deliver quickly, so I decided to move forward..I then ordered late last night after work."
1161,"After the first dasher dropped off, the second one Kayla was at the location..I called her and heard the lady at the drive thru window confirming my order over the loud speaker."
1161,Then she hung up!
1161,So I'm assuming that she took the order for herself.
1161,After that hour or so ordeal.
1161,I then spend another 40 mins trying to get a resolution from CS.
1161,I simply asked for a timely return of my funds and additional compensation in the form of credit for the last two horrible experiences.
1161,"I'm not fully aware of the policy, but just saying, well we returned your money does not seem to suffice."
5,"I don't use Grubhub much but when I do use it, it's always a problem placing an order."
5,I spent over an hour trying to place an order and my order kept being cancelled for no reason.
5,"I tried different restaurants, different payment cards, tried the app and internet browser but no luck."
5,"The generic and un useful message I would get would be ""Reason for cancellation: Unfortunately, we're unable to fulfill this order"" and that's all."
5,Another brief message I would get is to call customer service if the problem continues but could not find a customer service number anywhere.
5,"I finally found the customer service number by reading the reviews, I called and the customer service person working from home had a rooster that can be heard in the background."
5,"The rep did not offer any troubleshooting and or solution to get my order, only said he would escalated to a supervisor and it can take up to 24hrs for them to get back to me or resolve it."
5,?
5,??
5,The only solution I given to me was that I can go in person to the restaurant or call them directly.
5,I wanted the convenience of not going out and having my food delivered but it turned into a mission.
5,I used a different app and I was able to place an order without any problems.
119,This is not good service.
119,"Last 5 orders I had were horrible, take too long, food comes wrong or cold."
119,This time I ordered breakfast and after an hour with no driver yet - upon contacting chat they updated my ETA to a total of 2hrs since I first placed the order?
119,How is this convenient?
119,If I could I would go grab the food myself but there's a reason I order it.
119,Their only solution always is to give money back and $5 credit.
119,How about working to make the food get to me correct and on time?
119,"Keep your $5 credit, I'm never using this again."
1126,"Long term users subjected to dishonest dashing, may not receive fair services or compensation for dishonest deliveries."
1126,In my experience to recent events deliveries have been miss delivered to wrong complexes or apartments.
1126,"Due to this issue i've had re-ordered, sometimes repeating the miss delivery."
1126,"However, some dashers call the customers to make sure the order is in your possession by the correct building, floor and apt."
1126,In my last order DoorDash has miss delivered and denied any sort of refund or help.
1126,"In contacting support, all I'm told is that they cannot process any sort of ""transaction and there's nothing they can do for me"" However there is many things that can be done."
1126,Such as a photo of the door with the food and apt #.
1126,"Then, I'd at least know where to find my order, but they rather say they can't offer me money as the first and only solution leaving a sour taste in my mouth and a distrust in what they think of me and letting me know they see me as a dishonest customer or that my issues are below them."
1126,Id hope they reinforce dashers to check customer notes for delivery help.
1126,After getting in contact with many agents from DoorDash for the past two weeks they denied any sort of help or use of my account and I never get any updates about my $43 purchase.
1126,I'm not willing to ever use DoorDash again.
1126,Especially when I never had an issue using Uber eats.
1275,"Time and time again I order something from my town, and time and time again I don't receive my full order."
1275,"I process through the ""help"" tab, I do not want a refund I want the food I ordered for my wife."
1275,Consistently we have one of our meals left at the resturant even though we ordered two.
1275,The only solution offered by the horrible support service is a refund for your food.
1275,"Not for the tip, not for the delivery fee, just the food."
1275,So if I actually want my order I have to go back and spend even MORE on those things when it wasn't right the first time.
1275,Let me be clear when I say this has happened CONSOSTENTLY.
1275,"It's one thing if things are forgotten, but to pay MORE to have what was forgotten re-delivered?"
1275,Horrible service.
72,Multiple times in the same week I have had my orders delayed for over 2 hours or never received at all after saying they had been delivered.
72,Only after berating the first customer service person and being transferred to a supervisor then threatening to just have your credit card issue a chargeback will you be offered a refund.
72,Initially they want to give you coupons for future orders.
72,Like who wants to continue to use a service that's unreliable.
72,I would not recommend Grubhub to anyone.
72,They can't even contact their drivers when an issue arises.
72,I have never experienced a more incompetent business and will never use their service again.
565,I have had multiple issues with Uber Eats.
565,"I get that it's not necessarily Uber's fault if the restaurant messes up, but I expect Uber to take care of an issue with the restaurant should an issue arise."
565,"For the most part, Uber Eats has had decent customer service."
565,"However, I've noticed the past couple of times when I've had issues, the customer service agents have been less than helpful."
565,"They won't respond for hours, then when they do respond they simply offer a $5 Uber Eats cash credit."
565,"My last order for example, the restaurant forgot 2 separate items, and the 2 items I did receive - the first item was gross and soggy and the 2nd item was missing half of the item (burger but didn't have any sauce, any toppings or any cheese)."
565,"Uber eats simply said here's a $5 Uber Eats credit, even though that didn't even cover the cost of the missing items, much less the rest of the messed up and nasty order."
565,Definitely won't be using Uber Eats anymore!
16,Horrible system just like Seamless.
16,Do not follow there guarantee policy to cancel order if the order has not been confirmed yet.
16,"I've had problems with drivers eating my food, delivering to the wrong location, not reading my directions, restaurants not following my specifications so because of that Grubhub and Seamless have dubbed my account suspicious of getting large amount of concessions so this would be a reason to not be able to follow there guarantee of canceling an order if you use the wrong credit card."
16,They blame me not the drivers they hire or the restaurant that made the mistake or the fact that on multiple occasions I have lost my lunch hour due to there incompetence of not following directions or putting ingredients in my food that I am unable to eat or the restaurant is about 3 hours late delivering my food so they have a guarantee and I collect on that guarantee so if you do then your suspicious.
16,I believe this company is run by a bunch of idiots.
16,Here's all these guarantees we offer but please do use the chat and collect on them!
298,Of all the delivery apps this is the worst one.
298,I've given Grubhub chances over the years and and either delivering late or not at all on multiple occasions over the years I am officially done.
298,This is absolutely ridiculous.
298,I waited an hour tonight only to have my order cancelled.
298,I give it a 30% of delivery with Grubhub.
298,Use Uber Eats or DoorDash.
298,Regardless of price it will at least get delivered
627,Don't know why they stopped the feature of taking pictures after delivering.
627,They either never delivered it and I would always have to get a refund and wait again for my food to be redelivered or they delivered it to the wrong address and I would have to go look for it which would be housed away.
627,By the time I would get there the food would be eaten by the people there and would again have to reorder.
627,This happened on multiple occasions and Uber hasn't done anything to help better this situation.
627,Although Uber has done some good service back then but slowly more and more people are just being careless.
627,Uber hasn't done anything to help better the experience.
1010,If I could rate the Postmates service a negative star I would.
1010,"The app itself is fine, but the service is horrendous."
1010,On multiple occasions our delivery was missing items from our order.
1010,"After reporting the issue, Postmates would issue an apology but not provide a refund for the missing items."
1010,"We used to be able to get them to issue a refund after some arguing with customer service, but now they are saying we have had too many issues in the past and they won't refund for order issues anymore."
1010,I find it hard to understand why it is our fault for their delivery failures and why we should have to pay for items we never received.
1010,I hope sometime slaps them with a class action lawsuit because that is the only way they will learn that unfairly ripping off their customers and providing zero customer service is a bad business strategy.
132,"I used to us a different delivery service and I always had problems, mostly because the drivers didn't read or follow directions."
132,.But since switching to GH I no longer have any problems.
132,.The standard seem higher and that makes a huge difference.
132,.They care about us :))
129,Grubhub used to be awesome.
129,I can say I've spent thousands of dollars ordering from Grubhub in the last 2 years.
129,It was my go to when I didn't feel like cooking.
129,..Never again.
129,I am removing the app and getting rid of the subscription.
129,..I constantly have items missing.
129,1 in 5 orders will have all of the items there.
129,It is a fight to get a refund on the missing items.
129,"When you only order occasionally, they are fine giving refunds."
129,"But when you order 1-2x a week, they don't like to give refunds for missing items because they think you are just trying to get a refund all the time when that's not the case."
129,..Then there is the ice cold food.
129,I'm not spending $100 dollars for cold food.
129,"Not only is that a major health concern, it's not what I paid for, and they refuse to do anything other than give you a 5 dollar coupon for cold food."
129,Not cool.
417,You'll wait 2 hours for your order and it will either be ice cold and half-smashed or it won't arrive at all.
417,"But don't worry, they'll give you $5 off your *next* order in lieu of a refund on the food you never got in this one!"
417,I gave GrubHub 3 tries and they were all dismal failures.
417,"Do not use this app if you value your time, money, and sanity."
738,I want my order refunded!
738,I spent extra for priority and they couldn't find a 2nd driver after the first on cancelled.
738,Meanwhile it been 40 minutes since my food was made.
738,"The second driver drove around my hotel for 10 minutes then left it inside the lobby at a different door on the side, not the main door!"
738,My order was ICE COLD!
738,I paid $36 for a cold burger and fries and they have the nerve to give me back only $12.
738,I don't appreciate not being able to contact someone representing a company when I have an issue.
738,The entire process was based on erroneous statements that had nothing to do with what happened to me!
738,I feel like I've been robbed at gunpoint!
1060,My first and only order was all screwed up and then delayed to the point that the first driver left.
1060,That's on the vendor but the app is really limited in their accountability with how they communicate and resolve problems.
1060,You end up calling the vendor and hearing one side and Postmates just wants to cancel and refund.
1060,What a waste of my and I'm sure the drivers time.
1060,I'll only order from places that have their own delivery service.
572,"Do not ever click the ""cancel order"" icon for any reason because you will be charged the full amount for your order."
572,"..For example, I placed an order with a merchant and realized I had a wrong item, so I canceled the order within seconds after placing it."
572,I then proceeded to place another order with the same merchant.
572,Uber charged me for both orders even though I received only one.
572,"I understand if there is a cancel fee, but it should equate to the full amount of the order."
572,This is an extremely poor policy.
572,"If Uber is still going to charge for the full amount, the ""cancel"" icon should not even be an option."
572,I do not understand why this is.
572,It would be logical to deliver the customers canceled order if the customer will charged for that order either way.
572,Uber has lost a customer moving forward as I will not continue to provide them business when they take advantage of customers.
592,I don't appreciate how they try to charge you almost 3 times of what the food actually cost when trying to cancel less than a minute after putting in an order.
592,I noticed the app was still connected to my old address.
592,I have never used the app before but wanted to give it a try today since I am sick and needed food brought to me.
592,Even after changing my address and getting everything sorted.
592,It changed drivers more than 4 times and I got my food about 45 minutes later.
592,"Cold, nasty, and stale."
592,Usually I'm not one to complain but I felt like I was being ripped off.
592,Instead of a refund I got half the price worth of app credit so I can use their app again.
592,It's a very slimy business that just wants to take advantage of you like most other big corporations.
592,I'm very disappointed in the outcome that I had with this company.
837,Ordered McDonalds to have it stolen.
837,"Contacted customer support, they said they couldn't refund me because the order was already at the destination and I couldn't get my store credits back either."
837,"I wasn't late to bring the situation to light, I just didn't get justice."
837,Same guy picked up my food two days later.
837,"Needs to be some disciplinary action instead of just a slap on the wrist, these are some people's career and there are hawks like this who just take advantage."
1339,Update: Just ordered a meal for our family.
1339,"When it got here, a third of the order was missing."
1339,"Used the chat function in the app and the response was essentially ""We don't care that you're family is still hungry."
1339,Here's a few bucks worth of refund.
1339,"Better luck next time."""
1339,Joke is on them.
1339,There's not going to be a next time.
1339,..The app works fine.
1339,The service is the issue.
1339,"DoorDash let's it's drivers take on multiple deliveries at once, so it's not uncommon for your food to ride around in the driver's vehicle for 20-30 minutes."
1339,"By the time it arrives, it's lukewarm at best."
1339,"Also, you need to make it to where the customer can tip the driver AFTER delivery."
1339,Tipping beforehand based on the hope that your food will arrive is NOT gratuity.
534,As the title says this is my first time ever leaving a review here on the App Store.
534,Do not waste ur money with uber eats.
534,Delivery fees are true the roof.
534,"And you have to spend at least $15 bucks in order to get the ""0"" delivery fees that the alleged to give you for signing up for a monthly membership yet the fees are rarely are zero."
534,Granted they do bump it down a bit.
534,But the false advertisement that Uber eats has going on is beyondDisgraceful.
534,My main reason for writing this review or I guess I should say as I write this review.
534,I have been waiting 45 minutes for an order that the app said would take 15-30 minutes.
534,And the food will not be here for at least another 45 minutes.
534,Disgraceful to say the least.
534,I understand that your estimates are not going to be perfect but there is a big difference between 15 to 30 minutes in an hour and a half to two hours.
534,I will be leaving Uber one once my pay period is up.
534,And deleting the app.
534,Do not waste ur time and money with these folks.
534,But that's just my opinions on this trash excuse of a professional company.
534,Do what ya wants with the info
608,I love the app but I do wish there was a grace period to cancel an order.
608,A lot of the times when placing an order the restaurant immediately says that they're preparing the food and I can't cancel the order without being charged a hefty fee.
608,"If we had a 2-3 minute grace period to cancel the order after placing it, that would be great."
608,Main reason being that I had planned to cancel an order right after placing it because my friend wanted to order food with me and didn't say so until a few seconds after I placed it.
608,I went to cancel since they wanted to get food from a different place but couldn't without being charged.
907,The main reason I use Uber Eats over DoorDash and others is the simple fact that others limit the menu and your choices as where Uber Eats does not.
907,"If I'm doing to pay almost double the price to have it delivered, I want full access to the menu."
513,I have been an Uber customer for 7-8 years now.
513,Am an Uber one member for years now also.
513,Am always grateful and appreciative and share the same.
513,Until a couple weeks ago when my order was processed without proper promo.
513,So I cancelled the order right away and then processed a 2nd order with the exact same items just with promo also being included properly.
513,"Uber then allowed the restaurant to charge me for 2 orders, stating they had started my first and had lost the food from it which was totally nonsense from the beginning."
513,I figured given my thousands of Uber trips and maybe close to 1000 Uber eats orders that I have placed and never once had complained for no reason and this case is even clearer seeing as I ordered exact same items maybe 2-3 mins later and had no problem paying for them.
513,Went thru Uber support and was actually told by Uber employee that I was going to be credited for first bogus charge.
513,Then few minutes later I receive a separate message that stated that NO they were not going to make this right and that I have no recourse.
513,Meanwhile like I said thousands of Uber rides and a 4.9 star gold member and this is way I have been treated.
513,Uber is total disappointment and should be ashamed of themselves.
727,I ordered food from Uber eats and at the exact same time Uber rides charged my card as well.
727,They acted like it was something they never seen before even though they are linked apps and obviously give your card and information to other partnered companies to charge your card so do not install this app because your card info goes to other apps to charge your card who knows what other charges id get if I didn't notice.
727,Never got a refund only ran around then sent an email then ignored after my first reply.
727,They are obviously scammers.
727,Promotions aren't worth it if they charge your card for a ride to make up for it then play the scammer deck with a skip card in it.
1005,I use Postmates at least once a week on average and subscribe and ALWAYS tip drivers 20% plus and usually add Cash too just cause I know how hard this world is!
1005,"But IM still very upset that about a month ago I ordered a pizza when I was out of town ( I have my location setting set to while using app because I don't see the purpose of a delivery app knowing my exact location every minute of every day) when I got home LATE and exhausted from traveling I ordered supper and it was sent to a popular chain but in my previous location, I immediately received a notification that I was FAR from the delivery address and I canceled the order ( but was still billed) then reordered the exact same order from correct location and it was also Canceled!!!"
1005,Both show canceled on my account but I was still charged for the first accidental order AND had to cook supper at 8-9pm after traveling ALL DAY!
1005,"So, NOT happy about that!"
1005,I feel like im a fair customer and try my best to be honest and fair to my clients this is something that I am very unhappy about having to pay an extra almost $83 this month on my credit card for a order that was canceled within minutes of placing the order!
1086,We ordered from two different accounts (at the same time) the exact same order to be delivered to two nearby addresses (next door to each other).
1086,Ran this experiment 5 times.
1086,"""Priority delivery"" order arrived later 3 times and at the same time as the normal order 2 times… .P.S."
1086,"always add 30 minutes to the estimated delivery time, and sometimes add an hour…."
1086,"They are ALWAYS very, very, very late."
596,Very disappointed!
596,I was looking forward to the food that I had ordered for delivery.
596,Driver Kinzie was on time and called to verify my location.
596,I provided her the information she had requested and expected delivery of my order within a few minutes.
596,30 minutes later and no food delivered.
596,"When I called the restaurant directly(there appears to be no way to call Uber Eats directly), I was told that quite often Uber drivers pickup the order then fail to deliver and keep it for themselves."
596,Very shady business.
596,I will be reporting your business to the appropriate authorities.
596,I hope this review prevents this from happening to others!
0,1.
0,I've been waiting for an hour so far for my lunch.
0,An hour after the delivery time which already was an hour!
0,2 hrs!
0,The driver made at least FIVE other deliveries and she's not done yet.
0,I'm not paying extra per order to have my meal come straight to me.
0,She was at the restaurant quickly to pick my food up but then delivered to so many others!.2.
0,This is not the drivers fault.
0,If they agree to accept every delivery then it is what it is.
0,It's hit or miss if your food will be 20 mins or 2 hours.
0,"For as much as you pay per order so everyone profits, it's not worth waiting so long for the order."
0,And guaranteed it'll be nice and cold.
0,😠 or something will be missing.
0,Refunding my money doesn't make my food good or help with a missing item.
0,I've had to reorder from places to make sure I actually get what is correct.
0,Anyone else have picky kids??
0,You can't even eat and enjoy food when your child's doesn't come or has crap on it that you didn't order!!.3.
0,The area to leave directions to the house is way too small.
0,My neighbors are getting angry that cars are always at their house and I'm getting annoyed trying to reduce the directions down to.
0,250 characters.
0,"So if it's not clear, the drivers get confused and my neighbors and I are annoyed."
0,Whose fault??
0,FIX IT.
77,The added cost is getting to be ridiculous.
77,"Even with a subscription, I find myself paying an extra $5-10 not including a tip for the driver which I feel like is the only extra I should really pay."
77,"I'll often order from a location that is a couple miles, maybe 3min from my house and often times it will take 1-2 hours for the items to arrive."
77,"Usually old, cold, or just missing items."
77,"I find myself returning of course for the convenience, fully expecting a long wait and not so fresh food."
77,I try to order accordingly and only order when I really don't want to leave.
125,Grubhub is terrible!
125,They are so bad that I cancelled my FREE Grubhub+ membership.
125,That's right it was FREE and I still CANCELLED.
125,They ripped me off almost every order.
125,They even left my food at a house down the street once and animals got into it.
125,I was constantly missing items and the restaurants would blame it on the Grubhub app.
125,"Worst part is, I believe them."
125,"Customer Service never ever follows up, they promise you refunds that never arrive, and wait for you to constantly nag them for weeks before someone will even do anything."
125,They are terrible.
125,AVOID Grubhub if you can!
189,My order was delivered missing items.
189,"When I contacted the courier, I was told to contact Customer Service."
189,The courier was not interested in helping me.
189,Customer service processed a refund and told me I had to re-order.
189,There was no way for them to send the courier back or send another.
189,I had to reorder and pay MORE than my refund for the forgotten items because of service fees.
189,I will be deleting this app as soon as the replacement order arrives.
189,Do not recommend.
208,GrubHub is convenient and less expensive than other delivery places often food does get delivered cold and constant missing items.
208,Most drivers are kind.
208,GrubHub refunds quickly and has mostly nice customer service.
208,Overall great.
208,Just have had some incidents.
262,Consistently missing items on our orders and difficulty resolving the issue.
262,Reviews on App Store showing up as five star with no positive feedback in the actual review.
262,I think something is fishy here.
262,"Restaurants hate this app, it's so annoying for them to deal with and wasteful with packaging and plastic."
262,Same your $$$ and cool your own meals at home or go to the restaurant in person for a better experience.
286,I'm done.
286,Too many wrong or incomplete orders.
286,We live too far out so we tip really high.
286,40% on that last order.
286,"Yet when I called the delivery person, they blamed the restaurant and said take it up with GrubHub."
286,He is probably eating the missing item on his way back to town.
286,Then we still have to figure out dinner.
286,No thanks.
286,This relationship is over.
286,Nothing will bring me back.
286,👋🏼✌🏼
317,Missing item?
317,They're not going to redeliver.
317,Only refund that item.
317,It doesn't matter if it's the main food item or whatever.
317,"They can't refund the taxes, fees or tips on that item either so you lose money for them missing an item."
317,Horrible company policy.
317,"Grubhub needs to step up, no one would be happy with losing money for their mess up."
419,They don't take responsibility for any wrong/missing item delivered.
419,"They just issue a refund and tell you to reorder, but why would I reorder when I know the next one can be wrong too?"
520,I have ordered from Uber eats numerous times as a graduate student.
520,I have received ordered where my food is messed up and had items I am allergic to and had to be thrown away.
520,No refund no help.
520,Today I ordered food that was never delivered or was delivered to the wrong address and I got on chat and was told I made too many adjustments or complaints about past orders being the ones I received with either missing items or the orders were wrong!!!
520,Several I had to throw away due to allergies.
520,Then I am told I cannot receive a refund on a 50 something dollar order I never received.
520,When I called same answer.
520,The driver was not able to be reached on either end of Uber or I.
520,"You have a lost a customer, your competitors will go above and beyond to resolve issues and I have never once been refunded any missing incorrect and or wrong orders from Uber Eats."
520,You treat your customers like trash.
520,I am a graduate student who was treating myself to a nice meal for my standards and now I have no food and I'm our money (not cheap either).
520,"Shame on you, I will never be using your services again and will tell all my friends and family the same."
548,"Between UberEats and DoorDash, UberEats has been the worst app."
548,I'm constantly missing items from my order every single time but this time was my last straw.
548,I place an order and was waiting forever for it.
548,I could've drove myself to the location and got the items myself but I wanted something convenient due to me not feeling too good and needing some items to help with my pain.
548,.I contact support the first time to ask them if it could be canceled and support tells me delivery is taking too long due to it being busy today and not a lot of drivers on the road.
548,".So when I contacted support a second time to cancel my order, the person tells me to wait until the store closes and if no movement then they will refund me."
548,"Refunds take 5-10 business days so not only did I spend money for no reason, i have to get up and go to the store and spend EXTRA money just to get what I need when I could've done this in the first place."
548,"After this experience, i will be deleting this app and I will never use their services again."
554,"Some of the worst customer service I've ever experienced in my life, and not just once, on a repeated basis."
554,They really don't care.
554,"Any replies you get to requests for help are just boilerplate canned comments, which usually don't have anything to do with the issue."
554,They have devolved into the single worst company I can think of based on customer experience.
554,"They're genuinely horrible...Their drivers never check order accuracy, so it's often wrong, has missing items, etc."
554,"Uber support tells me that ""due to my refund and adjustment history"" they can't issue any type of refunds any more."
554,"""A significant number of refunds or adjustments"" reflects poorly on Uber Eats and their quality of service, not on my account history or trustworthiness."
554,I submit images when I have an issue — there's literally photographic proof of what happened.
554,"My integrity is not in question, and to insinuate that I am being dishonest is deeply offensive...Perhaps Uber should be more concerned with improving their order accuracy, drivers, and truly terrible customer service."
554,"It would be a better use of their time, rather than blaming customers for their issues...Whatever the competition is, they can't be worse than Uber...—..A final thought: looking through these reviews, I can't help but be suspicious that there are so many reviews that show 5 stars but describe horribly negative experiences."
554,"Given how untrustworthy this company is, it's not a good look."
601,"I've been a customer through Uber eats for quite some time and the communication between Uber, the driver, and the restaurant is incredibly terrible."
601,I tried to get in contact with my driver about a missing item after waiting much longer than I should have and he wouldn't answer.
601,Then I tried to get ahold of Uber Eats about the missing item and only was able to submit a complaint with no hope for resolution.
601,"It used to be much easier to resolve these issues, but it seems like they don't even have a chat function for customer support anymore."
601,Deleted the food side and most likely won't use the rides anymore if this is their customer support system.
606,They are horrible They don't give you every item you pay for and when you bring up this point no one is coming to bring it to you not is the order adjusted.
606,They have policies in place they say that will allow them to connect with their contracts.
606,I am disgusted by this waste of a service.
606,There is no way charging for something not provided it legal.
606,Hopefully my bank provides better support I have discontinued use of this trash service and hope more will report their discrepancies and so the same.
606,I had to pay money but they don't have to provide anything.
606,I also want to add that even after contacting the driver to return my missing items and they refuse I request my due back money and Uber reaches out to me about the refund.
606,Absolute trash service with no accountability to their failing operations.
610,As a part time Uber driver it is sad the decline of Uber….
610,"And worst part is it isn't always, the drivers fault..Time and time again I have been lazy and ordered food for my family and been sadly missing a large part to my order..The problem comes when the driver says restaurant and the restaurant says the driver and Uber has to pick a side…: I don't want ever a full refund but do want what is right."
610,"I have had deliveries across the street with pictures to prove it ""mind you I got partial credit"" to completely missing items "" with pictures to prove it""… I feel bad for drivers now a days and understand that they can sometimes get a bad rap, however Uber as a whole has gone down hill and will recommend anyone but them locally..""We understand your frustration"" is a cop out response and if you see it will be a red flag."
610,I'm about to say F ‘em
653,I use Uber Eats all the time.
653,I gave it 4/5 simply depending on the driver.
653,If your order doesn't arrive or an item is missing you can call Uber and they will refund the money spent on the order or item.
653,Also messaging your driver is useful.
653,Especially if you requested some thing specific or have had missing items from a certain restaurant.
653,"Uber Eats can be pricy at times, but the more you order the better deals you receive."
653,Using the deals section can help with this too.
653,"If you're saving $5-$10 dollars it off sets the cost of the delivery 😉, delivery without added cost."
661,Uber Eats this is the last dollar you take from me.
661,I'm done.
661,Every time it's something wrong.
661,So inconsistent.
661,My orders are constantly delayed.
661,It will give you the approx delivery time and then it gets delayed 30 mins or longer.
661,..Fees are out of control.
661,Always missing items or getting them wrong and they never refund or credit you for the mistakes.
661,Over it.
661,This app was my preferred app even though it's pricier than others but I've had it.
661,I ordered nachos and they should of been here by now but instead it got delayed over 30 mins.
661,I'm sure these soggy nachos will full fill my hunger.
661,Should of just gone to pick them up.
661,I have a twisted ankle so this is why I'm relying on this app so heavily lately… but dealing with Uber Eats is much more painful.
665,I like the app but when it comes to missing items beware of the times it happens.
665,They can only reimburse you a few times.
665,"After that, you will be paying full price without any type of credit or reimbursement for missing items."
665,Which I think is completely unfair because that's your money.
665,"Unfortunately, I have had the bad luck of always missing an item in my order and there's nothing I can do about it."
665,I think the person in charge of picking up your order should verify everything is there to avoid missing items.
665,Especially when the item is obvious.
665,For example the drink.
665,"Additionally, some drivers have poor communication skills and they make unexpected stops without warning."
680,Placed an order through this app.
680,Items were missing when the order was received.
680,"Contacted the driver through the app, his response was that we could get a refund."
680,"Called the restaurant, their response was that they would send another driver with the missing items."
680,The items never arrived.
680,"Then contacted support via this app in chat, response was that the ticket will be closed because they are experiencing some type of difficulty."
680,If the ticket is not resolved it should not be closed.
680,This isn't over until a refund is received.
680,When you go online you will see many people who have experienced this same issue.
680,This is not how you conduct business or treat your customers.
702,"Uber eats doesn't care about it's customers, doesn't care about our concerns or anything, be prepared to order food and possibly not receive all of your items and if that happens (mind you it happens often) be ready for them to tell you that  you are not eligible for a refund!"
702,It is the most absolute terrible display of customer service I have EVER experienced!!
702,"not only that I can count on three sets of hands maybe more the amount of times that I received my orders with missing items, cold food, food that's been tampered with, and the list goes on."
702,And they do not care.
702,"do yourself a favor save your money and order food elsewhere I promise you if you don't, you will regret it."
724,I've ordered from.McDonald's several times this year and every time McDonald's never sends me what I order.
724,"I've lost countless times money and all Uber says that they can't do anything because I've ""exceeded"" the limit."
724,So I have to pay a delivery fee which isn't cheap plus what we other things they want to charge plus my order from McDonald and the tip I give the person who delivers and yet I still have to deal with my missing items from McDonald's.
724,I wrote to those people and told Uber to check my history on other places to see if I've ever reported something missing from my order and the answer to that is NO.
724,ZERO would be best for this stupid app!!
724,Uber are thieves and so is McDonald's.
730,If I could rate zero stars I would!
730,I paid for Uber one and I would often use it for delivery and for pickups(convenient for lunch hour).
730,"However LITERALLY every time I order delivery there is an issue, either a missing item or a completely wrong order."
730,"Usually to fix this issue is a pain in the rear, they hide the options to call in and when you finally can they have you on hold for literal hours."
730,"Today they refused to refund me for a part of my order that I DID NOT receive bc ""last time we refunded you""."
730,So now I'm being faulted for their horrible service.
730,Subscription canceled and will never use any Uber platform ever again!
747,"We've Spent over 35,000$ with uber eats and did have uber one,working at universal studios we ordered more then 3x a day for clients etc."
747,with that being said we did catering and usually our orders are over 200$.
747,8/10 orders were missing items and Uber will not reimburse.
747,The restaurants have been very kind and said it is up to Uber.
747,With that being said buying something and not receiving it is stealing.
747,Hardly ever would someone complain but this has got to the point of embarrassment.
747,If you order something for an important respected client and it doesn't arrive and we have to take it out of our paycheck and it becomes and issue if it keeps happening.
806,I use this app often what irritates me is they expect me to pay for items I didn't get or pay for items that were wrong if I have proof that items are missing or the order is wrong it should be fixed whether it's sending out the missing items or replacing the items that were wrong are you or giving a refund or a partial refund but that's not how they do it they don't care if you don't get your order they don't care if they make your order wrong so I will not be using Uber eats anymore I have DoorDash I have Favor and I think there's another app on my phone
809,Missing items are a common occurrence.
809,"The refund does not mean much when I have already agreed to pay the money for food, I am hungry and the order is already 15 min later than the ""latest delivery time."""
809,No standards for drivers.
809,My order took 1 hour and 15 minutes for a 10 minute drive from McDonald's.
809,"My ""driver"" was a bike rider who blamed it on the ""traffic"" at 2am."
809,"Moreover ""UberOne"" often times costs more than without UberOne - I know by comparing to a friend that does not have it."
809,Cannot keep treating customers like this when there are so many replacements.
876,I've been a great customer on Uber eats but the last 3 months or so they have been declining.
876,The constant missing items and cancelations I've had from this app is absolutely insane.
876,It is so difficult to get a real person to speak to and when you get someone (super rare) they are no help and they end the conversation when nothing has been resolved.
876,"I am no longer using Uber eats and switching back to seamless because everything is early, never have missing items, and the support team is great."
876,Do better Uber eats.
946,"Missing orders, missing items, charging for orders not delivered after refunding for drivers bailing…but worst of all is their absolute lack customer service."
946,"After years of using Uber eats we can no longer deal with their lack of service, even as UberOne no customer service rep will help they'll just hang up when you ask a question they don't understand due to THEIR language."
946,I stuck around to see if it would get better but it only gets worse so to the competitor I go
957,Feeds me when I'm hungry !
957,!!
957,Not always a perfect experience but thanks for your hard work… would like to see more training for companies to provide better quality food and experience.. the oops of missing items has drastically improved … Thanks for that !
957,!
1006,"Tried using Postmates for the first time and after searching/selecting and then submitting an order, it kicked back saying ""no drivers available""."
1006,"I think okay, fine I'll see if other closer restaurants will work… I find a local restaurant and place the order."
1006,It arrives in a semi-reasonable time frame.
1006,Come to find out it's missing items from my order that I paid for.
1006,"I contact Help, who are absolutely beyond useless."
1006,"They just provide canned answers stating ""this order is not eligible for any refund or adjustment, but we will use this info to better our service in the future""."
1006,"I'm sorry, what?"
1006,"I have used other services (DoorDash, etc) who immediately rectify and take accountability for issues using their service."
1006,I even escalated it to a supervisor who literally just copy/pasted the same answer with no help.
1006,They also keep closing it out as ‘resolved' when it's not.
1006,I'm super frustrated and I will absolutely never use this service again after this being my first experience.
1006,"..Like I said, stick to the other companies that know what they are doing."
1013,Before the other night I had placed a total of 3 orders ever on this app.
1013,One of the orders I had ended with me receiving an order missing items.
1013,I contacted customer service and they fixed it.
1013,Fine.
1013,But then I placed an order last Friday and once again my order was missing food.
1013,I was told that nothing could be done for me as I had already had a partial refund in the past.
1013,Excuse me?
1013,So now that I have another bad order you decide to completely alienate me from ever using the app again by telling me you won't help?
1013,"And to top it off, you told me to go review the driver as a way of alerting you to my bad experience?"
1013,So you want the driver to take the blame?
1013,"..I am deleting the app, reporting you to BBB, and opening a PayPal dispute since you think you can take my money and not provide me the food I ordered."
1013,Never again.
1065,I spend at least a few hundred through this app per week.
1065,Love the priority option- multiple awesome paid member discounts per month.
1065,"Yeah, I haven't been refunded before for mistakes to orders or missing items but life happens."
1065,The pros far outweigh the cons.
1113,Starbucks was out of the drink I ordered.
1113,No one told me until the order was being picked up so I had no chance to ask for a replacement or cancel my order.
1113,Now I am being charged for a Strawberry Acai Refresher that I never received and I can't get a hold of anyone at Postmates to refund me for the missing item.
1118,"Giving one star because doordash has been my go to for a few years now, and when we have issues with the food they were really good at fixing the issue."
1118,I don't blame them for the crappy food that these restaurants are serving but I do expect them to at least fix the problem when there is one.
1118,"Last night I got a complete wrong order, showed the receipt in the messages so that we could at the very least get the food replaced."
1118,"Didn't open it, even offered to give it back."
1118,Or have a credit or refund.
1118,They chose to say we had did this before and there was nothing they could do.
1118,Which is ridiculous cause we have only complained one other time about this restaurant.
1118,"A year ago, at that!!"
1118,"But also who doesn't complain when the order is completely wrong or missing items, which has been very often lately which is why we started to use it less."
1118,"And then when I think just maybe, just maybe my order will be correct, this happens."
1118,Do we just accept it even though we spent our money on it?!?!?
1118,Like I'm sorry but that's not something I'm doing.
1118,I would rather have the food replaced than to receive the money but apparently they don't like doing that either.
1118,"So my family, friends and I have chosen to delete out accounts and go with another service."
1118,You should be ashamed of yourselves.
1118,Even tried speaking with a supervisor but still the same results.
1118,Be cautious using this app because they don't like to do what's right!!!
1118,Very disappointing DOORDASH!
1118,Do better!
1118,!
1155,Zero stars should really be an option.
1155,This is a shady company who will steal your money and customer support is a travesty.
1155,Randomly started getting charged in October for a Dashpass when I have not used Doordash since May.
1155,"The few times I used the app my orders were always missing items, which isn't necessarily the fault of the drivers."
1155,So whatever.
1155,My main issue is the random unauthorized charges.
1155,I go on the app and there's no indication of having an active account to cancel and if there was there isn't even an option to cancel.
1155,I go to the website and much the same.
1155,Finally I get on customer support.
1155,The first agent confirms I do not have an active account and asks me for a screenshot of the unauthorized charges.
1155,They wait less than a minute before closing the chat.
1155,At this point I'm beyond frustrated.
1155,Hop on chat again with a different agent and they assured me it's canceled and I will not be charged again.
1155,I asked for an email confirmation of the cancellation and refund.
1155,I'm still waiting to receive that if I ever do.
1155,We'll see about the refund.
1155,Don't use this app even once.
1155,They will start stealing your money.
1168,I love DoorDash.
1168,"I order from it probably 3-4 times a week, for home and for special work guests and events."
1168,"99% of the time, these orders roll off without a hitch."
1168,"The one time I have a missing item— the response is shocking, and just plain sad...DoorDash has quite an impressive ""What went wrong?"""
1168,response platform for their customers.
1168,"But what good is it, whenever the app then states it's refusal to issue a credit for any order error."
1168,My order was missing an item- quite a simple fix.
1168,"I submitted my response, chose the item affected, gave a description and opted to give a photo."
1168,"Got to the ""thanks for your response"" page— which thanked me for my feedback, but stated that DoorDash doesn't give refunds or even app-credit for any orders at this time."
1168,"Very odd, and quite frankly a bit jarring type of response."
1168,I'm totally shocked.
1168,My family's restaurant would never do that to a customer— it's disparaging to see this large corporation integrate this into their business.
1168,Please do better DoorDash.
1178,I have used DoorDash almost daily for lunch at work for about two months.
1178,"Really enjoyed the service, Dashers are accommodating, very convenient..I would say maybe 1 in every 5 orders has either a missing or incorrect item—no big deal."
1178,"These little mistakes happen all the time when you go to a restaurant..However, apparently after a few orders with missing items, they stop refunding for the missing items—and support chat will just keep disconnecting you before you can figure out what's going on."
1178,"I don't mind the little mistakes on orders, they're most likely not DD's fault."
1178,But SUPPORT trying to shrug me off so that they don't have to tell me I'm not getting a refund for food I paid for but didn't receive was infuriating.
1178,I think I went through 8 different representatives before we got to our conclusion.
1178,"And for the record, I wasn't swearing or harassing, nothing like that, just patiently trying to figure out what was going on...Hey, I wish that my orders weren't frequently missing items too."
1178,"But cutting me off from being refunded for incorrect orders, without an option for appeal, or to provide pictures—anything—that's unacceptable."
1178,"Like half my order wasn't in the bag this time..I'm not here to donate to DoorDash, I'm paying for a service."
1178,"If that service isn't provided, and I still have to pay, I'm deleting the app...It's too bad too, this was a nifty service."
1178,But bad policies like this are enough for me to just go drive around the block to get my own food.
1242,They have no form of properly qualifying they're drivers as there's many that sign up and steal your food by not delivering it.
1242,Then when you try to get a refund DoorDash declines that request.
1242,I had a guy take a picture of the road not even getting off his car just opening the door while my order is clearly in his hands and driving off with the food all caught on my Ring Security Camera.
1242,Do not order from here even the regular drivers constantly forget to get your whole order or properly ask for the items.
1242,Many times I've had to deal with wrong orders and missing items.
1242,They are terrible!
1265,Idk if it's the drivers or the restaurants but my last three orders I haven't gotten my drinks.
1265,"Idk if it's just a weird glitch , I get my DoorDash credits but I was throughly annoyed this last time."
1265,I'm sick today and I ordered a protein smoothie and a side flat bread only got my flat bread and the smoothie was the most expensive part .
1265,Then I gotta use my credits pay more money again on top of the credits to get it redelivered.
1265,"They should have an option for redleievry for missing items because then the person ordering has to pay another 5/6 dollars on top of the ""credits"" for the missing item that you already paid to have delivered in the first place?"
1265,Makes no sense.
1269,I have had many issues with missing food and incorrect orders from various delivery services.
1269,"Some is fault of restaurant, example giving driver wrong order,missing items."
1269,"Some is fault of drivers who for whatever reason don't arrive ,cancel or drop at wrong address and some the APP, example Outback Steakhouse twice now the order defaults to two salads when order sweet potato's with meals."
1269,"The discount now offered brought me back,unfortunate first order wrong and so bad no one would eat it,restaurant fault."
1269,"Second was Outback,missing food app issue and third is pending, certainly they won't mess up bagels and coffee."
1269,Fingers crossed.
1299,I used DoorDash all the time and had no problems until recently.
1299,I even purchased the DashPass at one point since I used it so frequently.
1299,"However, recent their app has had nothing but issues."
1299,"It crashes all the time, it always reloads and says it's too busy, and I am frequently left with incorrect orders or missing items."
1299,The most ridiculous part of all is the prices and fees.
1299,It's just not worth it for the poor service.
1299,"If you are left without your dinner like I was last weekend, (because it wasn't delivered with the rest of my food) all you can get is a refund."
1299,Then they charge you the same fees again to have it delivered.
1299,"Between the poor app performance and the lack of customer care, I will be taking my business elsewhere."
1332,A double edge sword.
1332,Can be very convenient but it orders are not correct no attempt is made to resolve the issue besides an automated credit.
1332,"Confusing when dealing with issues, do you you deal with dd automatic forms or call the restaurant."
1332,..Significantly more expensive than calling in an order.
1332,Prices are increased + fees.
1332,Ultimately I deleted my account due to the lack of issue resolution as many drivers leave food outside or missing items.
1332,There is a particularly large issue where most restaurants don't list there condiments so even if you call and request them they will often not arrive with your meal.
749,Uber eats removed my cancel Uber One button.
749,I had to contact customer service to cancel it and they still charged me on renewal date.
749,i had to message again and they reassured me its taken care of.
749,charged again and shows its not cancelled.
749,this time i messaged again and asked for a cancellation email.
749,they said they dont have the ability to email and cant provide proof.
749,so i am forced to pay indefinitely.
749,and their customer service is garbage.
749,they dont read previous messages and usually send a generic solution message.
749,it takes hours to get the point across.
749,just avoid.
749,Caviar is a much better platform
445,I received an entirely different persons order.
445,"When I chatted with GrubHub they said I wouldn't get a refund, and that to get what I wanted I had to reorder on my own."
445,This isn't acceptable.
445,"I didn't my order, and still have to pay for something I didn't actually get?"
445,I would not recommend anyone use GrubHub.
542,Thanks to chat team member Mariana P. I wont order Uber for a month from today.
542,Because my orders arrived damaged and incomplete from the grocery store after I bought nice hot pizza half hour earlier with the Uber eats app.
542,I provided picture of what was received and even found a recipt in the bag proving thus more nearly half menu items were just not there .
542,Secondly my milk came damaged and not fit for consumption a store Isn't allowed to sell bashed products .
542,Milk is something ingested of all ages.
542,Mariana a uber representative said there was nothing she could do as a chat customer service member and just write a review and they will learn.
542,They won't take it back and nor is this a joke so the items are being thrown out and I will be taking my car and capable body for food and grocery's now .
542,Mariana as the front face of Uber did absolutely nothing to resolve the issue but sent me to rate my experience.
542,Don't let a big day ruined shop the day before and schedule food day before also .
542,Comes to my realization now .
542,Bless everyone these are the facts of using the app.
833,Very first time using this.
833,I put a whopping 9 item order in at the local grocery store.
833,8:39pm was when it had went through.
833,"It is now 10:45pm, I've contacted the local store, they have no such order, yet UE claims it's still processing and I was waiting on a store provided courier."
833,The store closes at 11pm.
833,"So now my $100 is tied up in ""processing"" since they only put a hold on your card."
833,Customer service was slightly less than excited to do anything (nothing) they only gave me the option to cancel and wait up to 48 hours to get my money back.
833,"I hate to say it, but DoorDash is better."
931,They marked that my house was able to receive a few options.
931,I ordered some drinks from a grocery store.
931,"Seven minutes after the estimated arrival time, I got a notification on my watch that my house was undeliverable."
931,..This is a real disappointment because I am planning on moving to a suburban house in a big urban city.
931,I really dislike the lack of information or quality that Uber Eats provides.
931,"..It would be nice to be able to see the order/ driver notes and understand why my house was ""undeliverable."""
1270,But I do.
1270,"I love the ease of ordering food to be delivered, and the random promotions that are included with some new restaurants that have been added."
1270,Having Apple Pay as an option to pay is great as well - I don't keep a card on file but I do have Apple Pay.
1270,"Finally, the addition of grocery stores to Doordash has been amazing as well."
1270,"Sometimes I just don't want to go to the store and this may sound crazy to those who live in the suburb, but I don't want to lose my parking spot."
1270,Street parking in the Bay Area may be a large reason doordash thrives.
1306,"The only downside is that DoorDash doesn't do traditional grocery stores, at least in my area."
1306,Otherwise enough businesses in my area work with DoorDash to make paying the yearly subscription worth it.
1306,"I order dinner for me, the kids, my extended family…and I especially like to order chocolate late at night from Walgreens."
1306,If I really want cookies but the kids are already asleep (single mom)….I rely on DoorDash and Dashers in my community for little things to help my daily schedule.
1306,Thanks to Dashers especially!
260,Someone hacked into my Grubhub account 4 days ago and I have been trying to get into contact with them since.
260,Here we are day 4 and I've been on hold over an hour.
260,Still haven't gotten a refund or been told of the hacker still has access to my account.
260,Everytime I've called or emailed I get told someone higher up is going to help me and that hasn't happened yet.
260,They do not care.
318,Someone hacked my account and spent over $300 in varied cities.
318,Called Grubhub (due to seeing prefer I did not make) while it was happening and they did not cancel it they stated that it had to go under review.
318,I don't understand because I am on the phone stating it is not me making the orders and records show someone changed my Grubhub password.
318,They stating they are going to call me back but never do.
443,Someone hacked my account and changed email/pw.
443,I caught it before they could charge anything and had to cancel my connected credit card.
443,Grubhub proceeded to do absolutely nothing about this despite me reaching out multiple times.
443,So I no longer have a Grubhub account.
443,What a way to do business.
13,I'm done with GrubHub after this order.
13,Every delivery is late.
13,"The restaurant's provide the correct items, but we always end up staring at our drivers on the map going to the restaurant then driving to the other end of the city, before updating to say the order will be late and they've magically just picked up our food and are on the way."
13,"After complaining to GrubHub twice recently about cold food, both times they said they would issue a $5 make-good and neither time has that email been received."
13,"I always tip over 20% for the drivers, but then end up with cold food."
13,I wish there was the ability to tip after delivery rather than before.
13,I also wish there was a way to ensure deliveries came straight from the restaurant to our door rather than being the third stop on the way 45 mins after the food leaves the restaurant.
13,"I understand we're paying for convenience of not leaving our house, but the markups on all the food is ridiculous."
13,You're basically paying three times the cost for poor quality.
710,I was considering switching from doordash to ubereats until I made an order and received no driver info or tracking capabilities.
710,Ubereats said order was delivered yet I didn't have photo confirmation and it never actually did show up.
710,I contacted support and they told me I entered in an address I never heard of and refused refund even though my confirmation email had the correct address.
710,I had to call and they told me they'd make a ‘one time exception' to refund me since they said I didn't provide the correct address despite never using a different address and having confirmation of the address sent to me and shown on the app.
710,"Way sketchy compared to my experience with doordash, NO THANKS!"
737,Uber has changed a LOT recently.
737,Half of my orders are not delivered and customer service offers no help.
737,I simply can't count on Uber for dinner anymore...Example #1: A restaurant refused to fill my order due to being busy.
737,"They told the Uber driver, but Uber did not notify me."
737,"I wanted almost 2 hours because my order showed as delayed, but still in progress...I have blood sugar issues so this is a big deal."
737,We called to offer feedback on how important it is to update people.
737,"The response I had was crude and 100% not helpful....Example #2:  I have had many instances of a driver picking up my food, then canceling the order to steal my food."
737,Uber is allowing this by not disciplining the drivers.
737,I know this because I've driven before.
737,"I really wish they would heed this feedback....My fiancé and I work a lot, so we use Uber all the time."
737,I now order from DoorDash when my sugar is low so it arrives on time..
737,It's sad to see a company like this go to waste..hopefully THIS review will get somebody's attention.
883,"Normally I don't make a big deal when small items are missing from my ordered but the last order my entire order never arrived, the delivery person picked up the item and immediately set the order to delivered."
883,I never received anything.
883,I called Uber support and they issued me a refund on Saturday but on Monday they sent me an email saying I couldn't get a refund because I received the items.
883,I would know if I did or not...For this reason I'm not going to be using their service again.
922,Used this service only one time.
922,Ordered a pizza got it a few minutes late no big deal but the bottom was completely burnt black.
922,Even about half the top of the pizza was black.
922,Sent a image over to Uber east showing my pitch black pizza and there reply was sometimes traffic and other circumstances may cause your driver to be running late making your food cold we are sorry but there is nothing we can do to help you.
922,Never said anything about the pizza being late or cold and that's the crap they came up with.
953,When Uber Eats gets an order wrong you might as well skip dinner.
953,Their support times don't reflect the time sensitive service they provide.
953,I ordered food around 6:30 and at 10:00 I still didn't have dinner.
953,"..When my order was delivered late it was no big deal, I've come to expect that."
953,"But, I immediately noticed I got the wrong order altogether."
953,I used the app to contact the driver to rectify it before they got far.
953,They never answered.
953,..I used the app to contact support.
953,They did not respond quickly so I called the restaurant.
953,The restaurant called Uber and assured me that would call me shortly to replace the order.
953,..They did not.
953,Eventually I got ahold of them by calling their restaurant support number but by then it was too late to reorder.
953,..I got a refund.
953,"But I'm still hungry, and it's past my kids bedtime."
1282,"So, I have been using this app for a year."
1282,I have been having a problem to get my order as the dasher in my area keep not delivering my order and it takes three days to get my refund.
1282,There is no way to contact your dasher as from one call to the customer service they stated that the number in the app is not related to dasher but to the assistant or something like that.
1282,"It's just very easy for the dasher to submit that the order was dropped off, but there is no integrity check even though ""technology now can detect food package using AI and machine learning""."
1282,"However, it was easy to request a refund, but how could they refund the wasted time?"
1282,So I decided to eat healthy and not waste time.
1282,"Also I am a student, so getting my refund in three days is a big deal to me."
1315,"My husband and I have been using DoorDash for over 3 years, before during and after the pandemic."
1315,"This month, their driver hit my car parked on the road."
1315,"No big deal, it happens, it wasn't a lot of damage outside of cosmetics, but the driver drove off and we had them on camera."
1315,.
1315,".We contacted their legal team and informed local police, but DoorDash ghosted us for two weeks."
1315,"All right, we used our local police to subpoena the drivers information to get the incident paid for.. .We used DoorDash a couple times last week, but today, they decided to deactivate both of our accounts instead of complying with us."
1315,You've lost our business permanently.
1315,"Extremely unprofessional, and I look forward to your downfall for poor customer service."
1050,"If you feel dropping food off wherever and still being guaranteed pay and tips, join Postmates."
1050,"If you feel like keeping the goods of others and don't care if waiting with a torn ACL and are dependent on delivery for survival, Postmates."
1050,Don't worry about reprisal.
1050,The customer has no recourse through the app or website.
1050,Postmates closed the call center and even shutdown their help center email.
1050,They don't even have an automated message in the help center.
1050,"Free money, free food, and free valuables, guaranteed."
1050,Thanks Postmates
413,"To be honest, the only reason I'll give 2 stars is because you were the only app with drivers out right now."
413,"Otherwise, your delivery fees are disgusting and I wouldn't use your app if I didn't have to."
413,"But still, you came in clutch with a $20 double cheeseburger from Steak ‘n Shake…."
426,This service did NOT give me a $25 coupon off for my first order.
426,This is the ONLY reason I used this app.
426,"WILL NEVER be using this ""Grubhub"" a g a i n!!!!"
426,!
585,I am not very satisfied with Uber eats.
585,"They have a driver named Travis that has delivered my order to the wrong location twice and that is not acceptable, I was refunded for my purchase and not my tip then an additional $7 tip was taken from my refund and I am not sure how that happened but this will be my last time using Uber eats them I'm deleting this app."
585,The only reason I'm using it now is because I want to use my credit before I get rid of this app.
585,"Horrible service and they don't notify you when they drop your food off so how do you know it's the right location anyways, that is not how you do service it's like you have to constantly watch your food being delivered and you better not be busy because they will drop and just leave with no point of contact, they will refund you but your tip is GONE!!!"
585,If I didn't have too I wouldn't even give one star!!
585,!
832,UberEats got the delivery address incorrect (they didn't include the apartment).
832,"When I went to change it, the delivery was then deemed ""too far""."
832,"I've already rated the bakery involved, because the entire experience amounted to ""this isn't my problem"", and the customer service all around was a wild ride of indifference."
832,"The only reason I'm giving it a two is because the man at UberEats who responded to my call about the $15 cancellation fee was just doing his job – but, obviously don't expect any actual help if anything is off."
925,The only reason why I'm saying doordash is better is because it doesn't scam you.
925,"For example when I decide to order food and I explore but nothing interests me, I leave the app and go on with my day."
925,"2 minutes later I get a $10 off promotion, so I open it."
925,"And guess what, the promotion failed."
925,"This hasn't happened one time, but multiple."
925,So at least doordash doesn't scam you to open their app.
934,I order one simple pizza and it was supposed to come at 6:30 and I even paid extra for fast delivery yet my order didn't even have a driver till 7:10 and my order didn't come till 7:30(the only reason I'm rating it a 5 is so people can see this and not be scammed)
1026,The only reason it's not a 5 star review is there is not an easy way to file a complaint.
1026,I had REALLY bad service my last order.
1026,"It was all driver related and I could not truly express what the problem was, there was only options to choose from."
1026,"I will say y'all were prompt in giving a credit, but I feel like the problems with the driver needed to be noted and addressed which they were not."
1173,"I went in to order 2 bags of flamin hot lime Cheetos, and put in a few other bags of chips for my family."
1173,I was only informed after ordering that the store did not in fact have the chips I wanted.
1173,Fine whatever.
1173,Even though it's the only reason I even ordered.
1173,The dasher also can't find one of the other chips and I have to literally guide him to where they are via text.
1173,Then he finds that there is only a bigger more expensive version that I then have to pay more for.
1173,THEN they mess up the LAST bag of chips getting the wrong kind therefor rendering them useless as nobody in my house even likes that kind.
1173,"I'm fed up by this point and look to customer service to see if I can at least get some compensation for the bag of chips that was wrong only to find that I don't talk to a real person, and the robot tells me how I ""unfortunately can't receive a refund or in store credit due to our new policy"" so I've spent over twenty dollars with a bag of chips to show for it."
1173,Thanks DoorDash.
1173,I'm never using you again.
1342,Every time I use Doordash on my laptop there is a 30 second lag between click and the action going through.
1342,Sometimes I click add an item and it doesn't work.
1342,I have Dash credits but wanted to use my credit card to pay for a meal and the app / website would not let me.
1342,Overall horrible interface design.
1342,"Not to mention they not only charge extra fees, but also raise the price you see on the menu from the actual price the restaurant charges."
1342,"All things considered, you pay like $8-10 more on each order because of Doordash."
1342,The only reason I keep coming back is for the good restaurant selection.
481,"Defaults to 25% which is incredible in its own right, but they also calculate tip based on the total after taxes and fees."
481,Tips are supposed to be calculated based on the subtotal.
708,I am not sure how to get in touch with anyone in this company but you are over charging for taxes on food.
708,I want to see the additional charges on the receipt and where they are going.
708,This seems very suspicious.
708,Then you calculate the tip by the highest amount before any discounts.
708,I would like proof the drivers actually receives the full amount.
708,Seems odd to calculate tip by the price of food and not the distance they drive.
708,They have no association with the restaurant you are ordering from.
708,It should require a higher tip the further away the restaurant is from the delivery address.
515,I can honestly say it's been a pleasure ordering with Uber eats!
515,My year is coming to a close real real soon!
515,I think Uber eats has done amazing work and I will always continue to support them as a customer and as a company for a greater purpose for a greener future @ Net Zero Carbon environment!
515,Welcome to the future for a better world as we close out this year of 2022!
515,Embrace the challenges and change!
515,Embrace 2023!
515,It's only a boss lifestyle!
515,"Sincerely, Matt G. 😘 To: Alana F. The reason why we do not give the power how you want towards the drivers to confirm an order is because drivers will abuse it."
515,We need people employed at the call center handling business for order cancellation!
515,"I don't work for Uber eats, but I can honestly say on a business side of things… this is how it is!"
515,This is how it will always be.
515,To be completely honest with you Alanah F. If you knew business.
515,You would know why it's set up like this.
515,Try to worry about things you can control like… you.
515,Not a company that is in the billions!
850,"I used this app to buy lunch at work, and I missed a meal, when I notified the Uber driver, he told me there was nothing he could do."
850,"that is, I do not verify the complete order that should be received."
850,"When I called the call center, they told me that my account is not available for refunds."
850,so the only thing you could do is put a negative reference to the person who made the Delivery.
850,without more detail they robbed me.
850,No explanation.
850,I do not recommend this service.
850,How can they justify when they can make a refund and when not?
850,It's absurd customer service.
505,So as of today I deleted this app and I'm no longer giving my business to Uber for them to steal from me.
505,I ordered an item from a restaurant mango's grill Keller but on the same day i decided to cancel it and order something else from the same restaurant.
505,Upon my cancellation the app told me it would be a standard 4-7 business days for my refund to be processed so I was alright waiting but it was already 5 days and I had not received my refund so I decided to follow up and see what the hold up was just for Uber to transfer me over and over and end up not resolving my issue just to receive an email that I was not eligible for a refund.
505,I tried to call and a customer service agent from Uber notifies me that because it was past 48hrs of me contacting uber about my refund that they would not issue it back to me because they have ‘procedure's' in place to be followed.
505,I am not going to get my refund because I followed the process that the app told me to but apparently I was supposed to call Uber to cancel the order for me.
505,How does this make sense?
505,Why are there not steps on the app then to be user friendly and also give out information about cancellation and what not.
505,This app has left a bad taste in my mouth and please be careful anyone using the app.
505,This is daylight theft.
505,Save your money and go get your orders to go or dine-in.
505,My two cents.
505,If I could put 0 stars for this review I would.
563,I created an order and after waiting 20 minutes it was canceled and it said due to an issue with the restaurant.
563,So then I re-ordered waited a couple minutes and thought better of it and canceled and decided to call the restaurant.
563,Then I got a message from Uber eats that they were charging me for the full amount because the restaurant had already started the order.
563,So I called the restaurant and he said no they hadn't even gotten the order or started it.
563,So I called Uber eats customer support let them know that and she said that she would help me and then she put me on a hold so she could call the restaurant and confirm then she got back to me and said the system would not allow her to process my refund even though the restaurant had not started on it yet and that that's just the way that it was going to be.
563,She apologized and said there was nothing she could do.
563,Absolutely ridiculous the worst experience I've ever had and I will never use Uber eats again.
674,They lie to you about when your food will get there.
674,I'm sorry but idc about why it got delayed.
674,"This is the business that you created, now these things should've  been dealt with in the planning stages."
674,"Okay, say place an order at 7."
674,That food will  take 3 hourssss to get there.
674,That's IF you get lucky and get a driver who doesn't cancel the pickup halfway through(bcuz they are waiting to get the freaking food from the restaurant).
674,Which btw is Forcing you to wait even longer to be accepted by ANKTHER DRIVER!
674,"Then you get a cancellation notice 6 hours after you place an order(but can't cancel without getting charged the full amount) in what universe does one say ""food will be there 8""."
674,Five hours l8r ‘SpongeBob voice'
780,Uber refused to refund my order after it was delivered to the wrong house.
780,The picture that the driver took even showed it was at the wrong house.
780,I find it very frustrating that they still charged me the full amount for the food and the full amount I tipped the driver even though I never received my food.
780,I don't appreciate just being out the money for a mistake that was not mine and that I could do nothing about.
780,I will be warning everyone I know who uses Uber about this and encourage them to use a different service that I know will not charge their customers for items they don't actually receive.
851,"Long time user, usually very satisfied."
851,"Ordered dinner, said it arrived."
851,Went outside and nothing.
851,Had to go in app to explain that order didn't arrive.
851,For routed to a chat bot who told me order was delivered.
851,Explained it wasn't there that it must have been wrong address.
851,Said no refund due as delivered.
851,Finally got a refund but not for the full amount.
851,I paid $4 for an order I never received.
851,What is that??
851,The tip for the person who delivered to wrong address??
851,Had to reorder and now an hour and a half later still waiting for second order.
851,Not worth it anymore.
854,"I've ordered from Dunkin a few times, and the last 2 times, my order has been messed up."
854,"When I reported it, I was offered five dollars in Uber cash."
854,I actually wanted to chat with someone instead of just being issued a 5 dollar credit.
854,It would've been nice to either be credited the full amount of what was missing or the item that was missing resent.
1063,The fees on here are crazy wen you go ready them and what they are they charge us for the driver to get benefits instead of the company providing them and the service fee is for helps cover cost related to the order but what cost will there be 😂😂🤨 I mean I've literally had a drive tell me a restaurant wouldn't give them my straw cause I didn't request it but got a drink and wouldn't give him one yet I paid a service fee so you would think that would've covered it if I had to pay
60,"I travel with my job often, and have enjoyed grubhub for convenience..I was paying $10+ a month for the service..However I cancelled today."
60,The reason being that I couldn't order from a restaurant i ordered from last night because my credit card was put on hold for 48 hours.
60,Why?
60,Plenty of $ there?Customer service says for my protection???
60,But i can use the app in 48 hours.
60,Well that doesn't do me any good  now.
60,"The other weird thing is i could order if i was picking up, or wanted my food asap…?.I called customer support and they were more than happy to cancel my membership instead of helping me solve the problem."
293,Last night the guy sat in front of my building 5 minutes before bringing out the food.
293,Meanwhile the tracking software on the app way delayed.
293,..Tonight I'm watching the driver in the tracking app run all over town after picking up my food….
293,My food is getting cold as we speak.
293,Meanwhile he will pass the restaurant again at least once before delivering my food.
349,Picked up a pizza from one of Riverhead's finest restaurants last night.
349,If you want a pie that's done right along with the authentic Italian food they prepare; this is the place to visit.
349,Thank you Cucina25!
349,!
427,"Ordered through GrubHub for the very first time last night, and the whole process was seamlessly smooth and pleasant."
427,"..The transparency of each component of my order and cost, the transport component with the driver, and the estimated time of delivery was flawless and uplifting.. .I'm definitely a believer and keeper with GrubHub and will order through them again in the near future."
427,..Blessings and SHALOM!
427,!
503,I hate this app and have officially stopped using it after being played for the last time.
503,"For a month now, I have a petty neighbor because he beats on his girlfriend and I defend her by calling the police or telling our landlord."
503,"So I'm retaliation l, he's stealing my stuff: groceries, deliveries and my food."
503,I've told this app about what was going on and why I was having to recive so many refunds this month and even told them about the police report I've made because of all of this.
503,"They deleted my account…..their ""customer service"" calls me a lier and ends the chat."
503,Now they are claiming I have multiple accounts.
503,I'm sorry that people scam you guys a lot but that isn't every case.
503,I barely order out anymore because of what my neighbor is doing.
503,I ordered maybe 3 times and each time he's stolen it.
503,I've even had a driver last night just not even deliver my food and THEY REFUSED TO REFUND ME!
503,"I sent a picture of the driver pretending to drop off me food, pick it up and leave with it (yes I tried to stop him but I'm 7 months pregnant, can't really move that fast) all I wanted is my money back and I was made to seem like I was a liar and a theft."
503,"So I don't recommend this app at all, honestly I don't recommend any of these ""delivery apps"" DoorDash allows too many thefts, ubereats refuses to listen to their customers and grubhub is ridiculously expensive."
588,"I ordered a meal last night paid the priority fee to have the food come quicker, I even tipped because I seen a notification that a driver would get my food quicker."
588,"After waiting 45 minutes for a driver to get my food, I received notification that I'll save money if I get the food myself."
588,"I went to pick up the food and got home a ate some fries it was cold and nasty by then, my bread was also cold and my veggie platter was cold leaving me to throw it all away."
588,I msg support about a refund but they said it's nothing they can do.
588,"That is unfair and cheated out of money because if you guys at the time didn't have a driver, I should have been received notification to just pick the food up instead."
588,I already had to wait 45 minutes then drive 20 minutes to get the food and 20 minutes back home.
588,You guys have the audacity to tell me I can't get my money back.
641,I attempted to use Uber Eats last night with negative results.
641,The app is confusing.
641,"When the app said ""pick up"" I assumed Uber would pick it up."
641,"I mean, why would I go through a delivery service for a take out order?"
641,"Then when I discovered the mistake, help is no where to be found."
641,"When I DID finally message with someone, they told me not to call the restaurant to cancel."
641,They said to go back to the help section and request a cancel and they wouldn't charge my card.
641,"When I finally got back to the help screen, my previous conversation was there with no way to get back to them."
641,I wanted delivery because I couldn't pick it up myself.
641,"I was notified at 4:30 AM, that there was nothing that could be done."
641,"Thankfully there's DoorDash, GrubHub and Lyft because I'm done with UBER."
704,Had a driver steal my food for the first time last night.
704,First the order was delayed which I was not too concerned about since they gave me a $5 credit for the inconvenience.
704,The driver claimed my order was at the door but no order.
704,"I contacted customer service and they told me my order was not ""eligible"" for a refund because it showed that the driver reached the drop off location."
704,This is terrible customer service!
704,I've never had this issue or had a complaint until now and yet I could not get my money back?
704,The rep offered a $10 credit and never even provided that.
704,Ubereats really needs to do better when it comes to its customers!
704,I never received my food but was treated as if it was my fault.
814,The app is overpriced and dishonest all the time.
814,I tried ordering something last night had it scheduled for 2hr after the place opens and the thing says it's close then my order is cancelled I close the app and reopen the app and the store is suddenly open but I have to reorder.
814,That just wasted my time ALOT of it and ordering food from home is supposed to be convenient.
814,Feeling like your time is being wasted is a feeling you will feel constantly with this horrible service.
814,USE ANY OTHER FOOD SERVICE.
814,The only thing Uber can do right is cars.
869,Placed an order at 5:30 last night with pop up showing an estimated delivery of 6:10 to 6:45.
869,"Called customer support on telephone from app, on hold over 45 minutes."
869,"Chat was the same thing, you are 10+ in queue."
869,"I checked my front door before going to bed at 9:30 and still no order...Went to app and under past orders, it showed my  order was delivered at 8:30 pm."
869,I reached to my bank and informed them I wanted to file dispute.
869,I was told authorization was approved last night and as this morning it had been cancelled/removed.
903,I have had so many issues with uber eats.
903,They forget a item ever other order.
903,The biggest issue I have had with them was a week ago I ordered food and then canceled it a minute after I ordered and they charged me a full $23 for canceling a minute after I ordered and they refuse to give me a refund.
903,Then last night the driver was so stupid he didn't know what street to go on and ignored all instructions I gave him and he turned around and had my boyfriend and I sitting out in the cold for 10 mins.
903,This app is horrible use doordash.
581,Finally done with this app.
581,I've had several instances where my order is wrong or straight up missing parts of the order.
581,Today was the last straw when I received moldy food and was told that it didn't qualify for even a partial refund for the parts that were molded.
581,I even sent pictures of the molded food.
581,"Last time I received a ""partial account credit"" when my order was missing several drinks, (I was brought empty cups) and it gave me $5."
581,"The next time I went to Uber eats to use the credit it was gone and said I used it as a ""tip"" for the order that was missing my drinks when I most certainly did not up my tip at any point, as I always tip when originally placing the order."
581,It's frustrating to pay for food that I can't even eat and then have them not even try to correct the issue.
581,Definitely canceled my UberOne and will be deleting the app.
787,"As many other users have written, the app itself is probably ok but the customer service is horrible."
787,I use both DoorDash and UberEats but I've permanently deleted this app after too many bad experiences.
787,The problem has never been with the restaurants - always the app communication and delivery.
787,"The last straw was paying premium delivery fees, having 3 different drivers scheduled, and food that was ‘allegedly' delivered nearly an hour later, but in all actuality never arrived from driver #3."
787,"When I tried to contact the courier, I never got an answer."
787,And dealing with the resulting customer service was super robotic and unsatisfactory.
1061,"Too many times I haven't had my food or things delivered and nothing arrives, then you can't get a hold of anyone who's actually human for support."
1061,The refund they issue is just to use again and twice I've had the same thing refunded (not the item) I ordered a $28 total one night at 8 pm never received it...The refund came back the next day I used $25 since I already had it to get Postmates from somewhere else...Same issue ..The last straw for me was when I placed an order.
1061,"They said it was on the way.. kept saying it an hour later ""looking for another driver"".They found it 20 mins later ""on the way"" and then 1 hour goes by ""looking for another driver"".I couldn't cancel the order I forget the issue.I drove there myself and picked it up"
540,We placed an order through Uber Eats.
540,"Having waited for over an hour, we found the order magically disappeared from the app, after it presented in the app during this hour."
540,"No notification has been sent to us about this in any forms, not to mention why this happened, at all."
540,"We had to reach out to customer service, and then found that the customer service number is also not available in the app."
540,"We googled it, found it, called."
540,"The customer service associate told us there should have been notifications, and this might be an technical issue."
540,"I explained my disappointment about no communications, and she offered to send me an email notifying this after the call and suggested to place another order with the app."
540,She also confirmed all they can offer is an apology and a refund.
540,"The former doesn't resolve anything, the latter should naturally happen anyway."
540,"We totally understand that things happen, but this was how this was handled throughout the process when things happen with this app and company."
540,You all should be aware of this.
1162,"When I placed my order through the Chic fil a app, it routed me to finish the order through DoorDash."
1162,I didn't get a confirmation or anything for 10 mins and I went back to submit my order and it said my Cart is stale (I thought the order never went through since it still had my cart full).
1162,"Since a reasonable amount of time passed, I opened the DoorDash app and the order didn't show for me there either so I went ahead and ordered again, thinking it was my first time ordering."
1162,"When I placed the second order, some time passed before I got the text for the original order and thought it meant my second order (to me being the first) was being made."
1162,I opened the app and it showed just one order.
1162,A few minutes passed from that and the food arrives.
1162,I then get a text that another is on the way.
1162,I did not intentionally spend more than $110+ on chick fil a and their support acknowledged they were having technical issues and had me pound sand anyways.
1162,I'll stick with a different service - they've lost my business.
1262,"Placing an order using ""DoubleDash"" to pick up a 2nd order from a nearby place using the same driver to save yourself a delivery fee never works."
1262,The system always drops or never submits the 2nd order and then cistern service tells you to just place another order and pay all of the delivery fees and tips for a separate order that will arrive in another 45-90 minutes.
1262,"Meanwhile the system calculates a Dasher tip based on the double/combined orders, and then when only 1 order arrives, DoorDash refuses to recalculate or refund the double tip amount."
1262,.They chose to permanently lose me as a long-time customer rather than to just simply acknowledge there was some technical issues going on.
1262,"I closed my account permanently, and all my delivery orders will be through Uber now."
1262,.Sad.
1262,.Goodbye DoorDash
205,"The app's map has my address wrong, so the driver will ALWAYS go a street past mine so I'm always having to text them directions."
205,I even specify in the notes.
205,It's a real pain.
205,Please fix this!
205,I would like a priority delivery option like postmates.
205,Other than that I would've given 4/5 stars.
205,PS.
205,FIX THE MAP!
205,Please!
346,I really like this but they don't accept cash!!
346,I would be getting this WAY MORE but they don't accept cash😕 I'm a teenage girl and I do things around the neighborhood a lot so I get payed in cash therefore I can't purchase anything because they don't accept cash!
346,!😭 please fix this!
607,Dear ceo and the team that updates the app every time.
607,Please fix the issue with the live activities being disabled because I would like to see it fixed so i can watch the progress of my order arrive without having to open the app to watch it live.
607,If you fix this issue before it gets to ios 17 and then it won't work at all.
607,This app is great because it lets me know when the order that I need is ready to arrive...Ps.
607,Please fix this issue for the uber app also I would love to use live activities on my iPhone 12 pro if not I would probably buy an iPhone 14 pro or 15 pro/ ultra.
689,"What REALLY bothers me about this app is if the order doesn't go through because either a declined payment or the restaurant is out of an item, instead of sending a NOTIFICATION to you, it just doesn't submit the order and waits for you to open the app again."
689,"..This has happened to me twice in the past two weeks where I open the app 30-40 minutes later to check the order status, and it turns out that my order never even went through but now I can't fix the problem because the restaurant closed."
689,Incredibly annoying.
689,..PLEASE fix this.
808,Since the recent update I am no longer able to order on my iPad Pro as editing options are not available for any items.
808,For example if there is an option to choose selections on any item there is no way to do it.
808,Everything works fine on my phone but 95% of my orders are via iPad.
808,Please fix.
808,❤️
1072,"I ordered postmates and my driver told me that my order had already been picked up by someone and completed my order, however I was charged for the order."
1072,"I tried emailing, texting, calling and chatting through the app to fix this error and get a refund on my food that I never received, and after an hour I still have not been refunded."
1072,There is no customer service please fix this immediately.
173,I have been using grubhub to order food from my campus dining.
173,"I don't know when this issue started but I always pay with my campus card points, today I was unable to select my card as an option and the screen would glitch the moment I tried to click anything but ""Apple pay""."
173,I have a feeling it's a glitch or an update flaw.
173,Hoping it gets fixed soon.
567,I tried to use the guest option and it wouldn't let me just kept saying oops there is a problem.
567,So then I try to use my old account.
567,Had to make a new account with a different phone number because they locked mine.
567,For no reason at all.
567,Then I put in a help request and now I wait or make a new account.
567,I chose the latter.
567,The.
567,I go to pay and my first card won't work.
567,Says t try a new one.
567,Second card doesn't work try a new one.
567,Third card doesn't work so I switch to Apple Pay and use the first card I tried on Apple Pay and it works.
567,Also it took me almost 30 minutes to order because I kept having to retype everything and couldn't pay.
567,It's bad business to make it so difficult to get food.
567,Honestly if I wasn't so tired from traveling and hungry and since I have no other options I wouldn't be using Uber at all if I had another option.
567,I'm sure I'll get my account back after I'm already back home at this rate.
59,Awhile ago I ordered food and I was honestly so hungry that I didn't even pay attention to the tip amount.
59,I felt terrible tipping only $1 and went to change it once I noticed but was unable to.
59,I would have given a cash tip but I didn't have cash on hand so unfortunately the driver got only $1.
59,"Please, this shouldn't be a thing and I feel like you guys are kind of punishing the drivers for my own incompetence in a way."
59,Will change to 5 stars once it's added.
59,It doesn't hurt you in any way and benefits your drivers more than anyone.
59,"Happy drivers, happy customers lead to a happy company overall."
184,"I ordered from a restaurant nearby, the driver got there and my order was cancelled."
184,We called the restaurant to find out they only take cash and don't even have grubhub.
184,They didn't have any of the items on grubhubs menu on their menu.
184,No way to report the restaurant as not available on their app and their help section is no help.
184,Thankfully I was refunded considering I ordered $80 worth of food and we waited 45 minutes just for it to be cancelled.
184,Deleted the app.
755,Ok I get you want to streamline the app's UI but I don't know what green medallion or hexagonal S symbol means.
755,I can deduce the last is limited drivers in area based on pricing but how's about adding to the Help section what the logos in the app mean?
755,That would be super useful!
755,I'll be honest seeing confusing logos with no meaning (context) attached to them irritates me to no end (actually kinda pisses me off).
755,As a software developer myself I don't appreciate when developers do things to make themselves look clever.
755,It's about the users not how clever you are.
755,Sorry rant over.
307,I have ordered from Grubhub a lot .
307,"..The app does its job, but when you get to people it changes with drivers and restaurants."
307,"..Do not blame this app service if your order is wrong, or not cooked correctly."
307,"..For the most part 80 percent of the time everything is good, but there are times that things aren't great."
307,Don't blame the app… also you may not get satisfaction for refunds or messed up orders as the app doesent cook the food or deliver…
723,3 times already my orders have been cancelled while I was at work.
723,Normally I wouldn't have cared but I wasn't notified till one hour after I put in my order leaving me no time to reorder and leaving me hungry during my 12 hour work shifts.
723,There are people like me that rely on this service.
723,"No I have heard my coworkers say ""well just bring lunch"" that only solves my problem and not the problem on the app."
723,For the most part I enjoy this app and they are accurate and communicate well but this has not been the case my 3 orders from subway.
853,For the most part they're pretty good but I've had multiple instances where I put an order in and Uber eats never sends it to the restaurant or when I put in an order it'll take hours for a driver to accept my order.
853,I've been waiting for my coffee for over an hour and a half and still no driver.
853,I even called support once already.
853,It's not all their fault but this is happening frequently enough to be incredibly irritating
884,Unfortunately companies like Uber contribute to the air pollution by causing more cars to be used.
884,"Regardless if those vehicles are electric or not, the charging stations for the electric vehicles require a large amount of fossil fuels to operate and their batteries contain dangerous gas/poisons like cyanide."
884,Makes you think right?
884,Why is our society going backwards?
884,Banning plastic bags?
884,All these measures have 0 impact on improving the environment unless every country on the planet exceeded them.
43,My delivery driver contacted me and told me if you want your food come outside of building complex then he suddenly left when he was in front of the gate and said he thought his gas is low and can't make it to fourth floor and when I told him I gonna report it he said I gonna tell grub hun you don't want your food?!!!
43,Extremely experience … then I contacted customer service the customer service said you want refund or your food?… I never seen such an experience with Uber Eats or Favor….these all happened while I have already left same instruction that all other delivery app easily delivered the food… and the customer service ended the chat too soon before I can say my request completely… these all happened while my order was expensive and I left a good tip!
43,!
98,I'm going to stop using Grubhub and go back up Uber eats!
98,Grubhub drivers never follow delivery instructions and yet I have no way to void / remove tips for poor service unless I contact Grubhub and spend 30min in que!..Other apps I can add or remove tips after the delivery myself but Grubhub automatically gives the tip and makes it hard to remove it making their drivers lazy and feeling entitled to something that is earned through hard work and good service!..Also for crying out loud add a option for basement apartment in your address fields!
98,Using delivery instructions for it when your drivers don't read them or can't read them is ridiculous!..And finally vet your drivers!
98,Half the time my orders are delivered by people who look nothing like the photo (picture 20yo white lady / delivered by 50yo Hispanic male) ..Makes me think Grubhub is enabling identify theft or providing means for those ineligible for work in this country to circumvent their illegal status!
112,You may find the same restaurant at Uber eats but somehow there cheaper on here.
112,Delivery is also faster .
112,Once order is Placed a driver is sent immediately to the restaurant.
112,Very convenient.
112,Variety of restaurants to choose from.
112,App is easy to navigate .
112,No problems with making payments.
112,Definitely recommend using it .
137,"I ordered a meal from my local popeyes the driver called me saying a new one picked the order up I said okay than it says it was dropped off but they dropped it off at the wrong place and door, they told me they would give me back my money in 5-10 business days and a discount I don't want any of that I wanted my food I Aready had a problem with DoorDash and Uber eats apps now this I just want to have some food but I didn't get to🤦🏽‍♀️ I trusted them because from work everyone would order from Grubhub just to get is b.s… never again"
138,After waiting 2hours for my meal I contacted customer care told them I'm a business owner as well and this is unacceptable im hungry and they offered me $5 on my next meal I said no I want the food I ordered I'm hungry they pushed my food back another hour so I'm starving at this point if your reading this don't waste your time just install Uber eats wayyyy faster and excellent customer service and instant refunds if needed 💯 I'm going to wait this 3rd hour for my food enjoy your day and don't make the mistake I made by giving them my money🤝🏽
140,The food is always hot and fresh and on time when I order.
140,The driver is nice and professional.
140,I recently ordered food using Uber Eats and my food was cold each time and one time the food came almost one hour after the restaurant said it was ready but waiting for the Uber driver to pick it up.
140,I will continue to use Grubhub!!!
140,!
198,I'm going to keep it simple and true.
198,I had ordered chipotle and clicked on steak burrito.
198,They had only sent me the steak in a bowl I had asked for a refund and just wanted to take the fees for the steak they told me no.
198,And left the chat immediately.
198,See that's just one instance there's many more.
198,The drivers will cancel on you instantly.
198,You'll get like 3-4 drivers before you actually get your food.
198,I feel like these are the drivers that got fired from Uber eats.
221,"I switched to Grubhub after noticing an alarming decline in quality of customer service, delivery delays, and rude/unprofessional  delivery drivers with Uber eats."
221,I've never had a bad experience with Grubhub and have has delivery drivers go above and beyond.
248,"Out of the three delivery companies I've tried (Doordash, Uber Eats and Grubhub), this one has the cheapest rates."
248,The drivers are also usually pretty nice and fast.
248,"The only downside is that once you have a few orders refunded, you're told that they can't do anything for you."
248,"I have problems with almost every other order, but since I got it delivered it can't be fixed or refunded."
281,They are the best quality food delivery service on earth.
281,"They stand behind their products and unlike garbage Uber eats who don't do anything if order is wrong, Grubhub actually apologizes and refunds the money."
324,"Tried 3 times to place an order and it would place and immediately cancel…contacted customer service and the response/solution was to ""uninstall and re-install the app""…then they asked me to try their website but to clear all cookies and cache, Seriously???"
324,..Guess what?
324,I uninstalled the app and used Uber Eats that worked perfectly…bye bye Grubhub!!!!
324,Worthless and a waste of time.
325,I had bad luck with a local restaurant messing up my orders significantly enough that I couldn't eat what they brought.
325,"After 2 times Grubhub said I was requesting ""unusual amounts of refunds"" and refused to refund money."
325,This was after I ordered a family meal for 8 people and received a single sandwich and had photos of the receipt showing the wrong item was delivered.
325,This place is a scam.
325,Go with DoorDash or Uber eats.
347,"Your app is terrible to many complications with the gps and delivery the drivers are doing there part by delivering the food just never to the right address I hope in the future this is resolved or this company is dissolved, very unsatisfied I only used this app because I didn't see Wendy's on Uber eats with 0 dollar delivery will never order from this app again."
352,I have the premium service for DoorDash GrubHub and Uber eats.
352,I've never had as many issues with the other two that I have had with Grubhub.
352,"Today, for the second time in a row, I've wasted an hour or two trying to order through Grubhub."
352,Either the food never arrives or the order is terribly incorrect.
352,Cannot recommend the app any less.
388,"I've order food from the app 3 times, each time they delivered they have forgotten to bring half the order."
388,This last time I got 9 out of 18 wings and the forgot my waffle fries.
388,"I was willing to not complain as long as I was refunded, but the gave me back only 20 dollars on a 60 dollar meal missing half the items."
388,Time to uninstall and stick with Uber eats or DoorDash
457,"My account, like many others, was hacked."
457,I got charges to my bank and had to cancel my card.
457,There was no customer support from grubhub and i already favored all of the other delivery options.
457,If you see this message just stick with uber eats or doordash.
457,Do some research for alternatives and dont get this app.
506,"I cannot believe what just happened, Uber eats randomly charged me a 30$ ""authorization fee"" (this"" fee"" was only labeled after hours trying to get someone to help me), right as I was placing my order- so when I agreed to it I was under the impression I was saying okay to my order being placed."
506,"I was placing an order around the same price, slightly higher than this ""fee"", which at the time I assumed it was the discount being applied like the button I clicked on, said would be applied."
506,"It goes through, and when I go to check my orders eta- no such record of the order has been placed but the money sure has been taken out of my account!"
506,"Customer service pretended to check on my order then claimed they were transferring me to someone with more resources than they currently had, and ended the chat with me."
506,"No transfer was made, no contact was attempted."
506,So I go through the process again- this time I am told to check my email.
506,All the while I am out the amount of my order and no order has been placed and no one is offering me any type of solution.
506,I check my email and about an hour later I get the explanation that this is an authorization fee that will be released in 3-10 days.
506,"It would have been better if they just said, ""we're sorry we messed up"", vs. the ridiculous explanation I was given."
506,"I'm sure it's for legal reasons, but I feel like I was politely robbed."
512,We usually order from a restaurant close to our place.
512,We usually do pick up.
512,When you go there and order.
512,The food comes out to be really tasty.
512,It's a top rated restaurant.
512,They usually are very busy on weekends.
512,It's from past few months that's Uber eats are giving offers on orders.
512,We ordered from this restaurant and the food comes out to be stale.
512,Only the rice was okay as it was eatable.
512,It was too salty.
512,And the chicken was soggy it was smelling badly.
512,Firstly I did not receive any response in 15 hrs.
512,So I raised the request again.
512,I have never wrote a review on AppStore.
512,But this time it's quite frustrating as the support manager says that they cannot give a refund this time as it will be not fair for everyone using the app.
512,I didn't understand.
512,My simple concern was why should I pay for a food which is stale?
512,Is it fair for a customer?
512,I also attached a picture of food which I trashed.
512,Isn't it enough to prove that your customer is loyal?
512,Also I have ordered online seven times from same restaurant.
512,Whenever I order directly from this restaurant the food is good and whenever I order using some offer I receive food which is okay or stale.
512,So is it about the offers?
512,I am sorry as customer I am disappointed about the food and not the refund.
514,"Like I was reading some of the comments, and I decided to take matters into my own hands and where did cabbage all right these prices are Roué too high, and like these prices need to go down because like there's no way this is like it's not like you're like high top stare at it so high top quality yeah I make it seem like that y'all deserve all this money."
514,I understand that people are coming out that I did the title or rest of the color kick at least behind but still this is that kid that docket have a whole lot of like prices like that are so high it's like it's so hard to explain like I've always like to order a pool like a small plate of food with a side of Drake ever in two deserts came out to be at least $60 plus delivery fee and I was a new post sick one DoorDash it does that do this just say yeah sometimes DoorDash pack it up is that like that but at least if I opinion at least DoorDash is not so freaking expensive Uber eats is way too expensive.
514,Y'all need to bring down your prices please.Retarded
518,I am completely and totally frustrated with Uber eats!
518,"As such, once this order is completed, I will be deleting my account!"
518,I was blackballed for requesting a refund or credit for drinks that were missing from my order on at least three different occasions!
518,"I didn't request a refund on a whole meal or anything like that, just the drink because it was either missing or wrong!"
518,I was told my account had been flagged for requesting too many refunds!
518,Imagine this!
518,"On one of the orders I was charged $13 for a drink from Starbucks, that I never even received!"
518,"I provided pictures for ""the delivery,"" yet I was still charged for the order, including delivery charges!"
518,How insulting is that?!
518,"In the last 2+ months, it is not an exaggeration to say that I've spent at least somewhere in the neighborhood of $150-$200 using Uber eats, and this is the things that I get!"
518,"I called in to give them an opportunity to fix sad situation‘s, but they refused, so I'm done!"
518,"If there was a number of stars lower than one, I would've given that!"
518,That's how frustrated I am!
518,"I think DoorDash, GrubHub, or Postmates would be happy to take the money that I spend, since Uber eats is not interested!"
519,I recently tried to use Uber eats to get some Chinese from one of the restaurants in town.
519,I ordered from said restaurant and patiently waited for my food to get to me.
519,The driver never even moved to pick up my order.
519,"The app tried to find a new driver after 30 minutes, but no one was found."
519,I waited another 30 minutes before I ended up canceling my order.
519,I feel bad for the restaurant having to waste $25 worth of food because an incompetent driver didn't pick up my food.
519,I feel like I've just been scammed and I won't be giving UberEats another try.
519,I'm currently waiting for my refund and won't be ordering from you guys again...Update: I got my full refund.
519,I will say that the refund system is much better than DoorDash's system.
519,I got my money back right away.
519,I did try to order through them again and basically the same thing happened to me.
519,I had to refund again and got my money back right away.
525,Uber eats is wonderful.
525,I have no complaints about it.
525,The only thing is about the workers.
525,It's amazing it's just a extra money that you have to spend.
525,You know when you're lazy whatever Uber eats is the best name that ever happened especially during the pandemic you should definitely definitely definitely download this app.
525,"When you can't go outside if you have Covid, you could just Uber eats your food it comes from Stop and Shop Chick-fil-A in McDonald's popyes always fast food places even restaurants even him and even supermarkets on."
525,This is not like I'm not mandated to do this.
525,I'm just a regular person behind the phone and I feel like this is just amazing.
525,amazing amazing.
525,Amazing definitely download it.
525,You will not regret it and this is not sponsored by anyone just about my personal experience.
525,Many people may have had negative experience with my strange amazing have no complaints about it very well.
525,Nice to hav
528,"I usually always order Uber eats, so I know how it goes ."
528,I ordered yesterday night high priority.
528,"Well, the order submitted and the restaurant took the order."
528,It literally took 2 hours for them to get a person to deliver it.
528,"As I spoke to customer service, they said a person was on the way."
528,I was upset over it taking that long and I paid priority.
528,The customer support asked if I just wanted it canceled and I said no.
528,"Next thing, after I waited (2 hours!)"
528,"just get a person on the way, they canceled it after I said not too!"
528,Then the customer service person said they didn't do it and ended the chat abruptly.
528,So my question is if the driver had the food why was it canceled and where did my food go?
528,I do not care if I got my money back.
528,That is BEYOND ridiculous  and unprofessional.
528,I don't want to order from this app again if that's what they do.
528,I waited for food until after midnight just for customer service to cancel it against my wishes.
528,I could have ordered somewhere else for that.
528,"Now, I will use another app since this one is incompetent."
528,I have the whole conversation and it's horrible service!
533,update: I tip the driver five dollars cash and Uber eats felt that they had the right to put a four dollar tip on my credit card… And two days later I am still waiting for customer service to remove that.
533,Seriously?
533,Avoid these losers at all costs!
533,"At first, I had a couple of great experiences until I didn't!"
533,My orders were completely wrong and incomplete.
533,They would forget the drinks or whatever.
533,Then there were people delivering my food that were not the right driver etc.
533,"Finally, I complained and I was offered a $5 credit."
533,The app would not allow me to use this credit and when I complained to customer service they ignored me!
533,"Yes, they are really truly rude and do not care a bit about customer service."
533,"You would think with all the fees they put on, they would care a little bit more about pleasing the customers like myself who is a gold member."
533,But they do not!
533,Just call the restaurant directly.
533,You'll have better luck and save money.
533,These guys will eventually just sell to DoorDash anyway because customer service is not where it's at.
539,I am absolutely fed up with Uber Eats and the extremely scamming drivers on there.
539,"This is the second time a driver scammed me out of an order, and this, Uber sided with them and did not provide a refund at all."
539,"They told me I accepted full responsibility for where it was delivered, even though the driver never communicated with me at all and didn't follow any of my instructions."
539,"I made a $25+ order and when it said the driver was ""dropping off"" the food, he literally took a picture of a random street/side walk and said delivered."
539,"He basically stole my food and provided ""proof"" with a random pic, because they know the representative are too incompetent to do anything as long as there's a pic."
539,I'm totally over it.
539,"I wish I could post screenshots too, just to show how messed up this company really is."
539,Now I'm choosing to file suit at small claims court because this is completely unacceptable.
539,They are basically getting away with stealing and I'm not standing for it.
539,I don't care how much money it is.
539,"Please just stay away from delivery apps, especially Uber Eats."
543,places consistently get my orders wrong and i always make sure to request for a refund when i receive something incorrectly (i have severe food allergies so when i get an incorrect order it could be life threatening) and they started telling me i will stop being able to get refunds because of requesting refunds too often.
543,it's not my fault places get my order wrong and i should be entitled to a partial refund if some of my order is wrong.
543,"of course i still tip the driver and pay the rest of my order, but when my order is literally inedible because of my food allergies it's not fair that i don't get a refund??"
543,i guess i'll stop using uber eats as much because they're punishing ME for receiving the wrong order.
543,totally unfair and when i contacted uber eats support they sent me a very obvious cookie cutter email that didn't even address my issue and then later on banned me from receiving refunds.
543,ridiculous.
552,I had the Uber Eats pass for quite some time and ordered regularly with minimal issues.
552,"Today my order (which was medicine I could not go get) was delivered to the wrong address, the picture of the delivery showed it was not my house and I didn't have the items on my porch."
552,I spoke with 2 customer service reps and they both argued with me and said it was delivered to the correct address.
552,It was NOT.
552,Literally standing on my porch arguing with a rep who said it's there!
552,They were insistent on not refunding then ended the chat.
552,I am beyond frustrated.
552,"I wound up calling and a refund issued, minus the tip which is a joke since it's the drivers error."
552,Whatever.
552,Never using this service again.
552,"Mistakes happen and I get that, but don't argue with me telling me my order was there when it wasn't."
552,"Get better GPS for your drivers, or have the drivers actually answer your call when you call them, as the driver declined my call."
552,"This service is a joke for how expensive it is and how horribly you treat your ""valued"" customers."
559,I use this app because it's one of a few options and they're the least crooked than the rest have great drivers.
559,The company needs a over hauling in its management department because they should be ashamed of taking people's money when they screw up.
559,Grub-hub is a complete rip off tho takes 3hrs to get a Order or half if it's missing or someone's else and it's cold from being last on there 30 person delivery.
559,So thank you Uber drivers you deserve more respect because you guys are why I choose Uber eats.
559,"Sure isn't the crooks running it sad sad sad people they must be to be okay of ripping ya off with there ""policy"" on order details."
559,Offer no apology or refund nothing but oops to late or we can't do anything but we're keeping your money.
559,Yeah your just lack of options Uber eats.
559,I'm designing a home town thing I hope puts all of ya out of business.
559,Costumers come first.
559,Have a blessed day and I pray you don't get what you give.
559,Because it's horrible to be ripped off and having nothing ya can do but accept it
560,"For the amount of money the charge you, the orders should always be right and when they aren't you should get something besides your money back for missing or damaged items."
560,"When I order a meal, a missing drink could ruin everything and it happens all the time."
560,"Missing drinks, missing utensils, damaged containers, etc.."
560,They also don't honor the deals that the restaurant is running.
560,"Every time I order through Uber eats it feels like crap shoot on weather my order will be right or not, it's very annoying."
560,"I use to order through Uber eats all the time, like a couple times a week but after so many issues I stopped using them as much."
560,Now I only use it when I absolutely have to like today and guess what?
560,My drink was missing.
560,They told me sorry and that they would refund my money for the drink in 3-10 business days.
560,SMH.. Good luck on your next order
573,At first my boyfriend and I thought it was a glitch.
573,"However, this is the 3rd time someone has supposedly picked up our order and then ""dropped it""."
573,"So a delivery that should've taken 30 minutes has now taken over an hour because Uber has to keep finding other drivers to get our order… At times, we've even experienced a situation where after 20-30 minutes no one has even attempted to pick up our order, leaving us wondering if we're being low-balled by this company :/ I don't understand what's happening on this app."
573,"Sometimes, by the time we get our food it's basically cold and we have to reheat it."
573,It's almost like we should've just gone to get the food ourselves by this point.
573,Our experiences with Uber Eats have taken the convenience out of it for us and we will no long use this provider.
577,I'm almost certain that the lack luster service I repeatedly get is Ubers fault.
577,"8/10 times there is a problem with my order and as it happens so often, they have stopped compensating."
577,"I have never used an app where the drivers take off with your order more than this one, sometimes I'll have a driver take the food just to have a bunch of new drivers go to the restaurant and be told that it's been picked up."
577,"Instructions and what not are never followed, if something is missing, they just don't care and Uber eats isn't going to do anything to help."
577,"Also, delivery times are incorrect, orders always take 2 hours or more to get to me, cold and stale; even when I pay extra for express, it gets partnered up with order peoples orders and still takes 90+ minutes to get anywhere."
577,"I would go and use literally any other app for food delivery, avoid Uber eats at all costs."
578,I don't know what the issues Is with Uber eats never had any issues with them but now I'm constantly running into issues...I was waiting for their driver to pull up he never showed up never came and I called him asking him where is he at couldn't understand a word he's saying then he told me he accidentally pressed the order complete button and that he'll be there shortly.
578,..So now I can't even see where your at and you have my order and I called him again he said the same exact thing I'll be there shortly I told him the gps said you was nearby like not even a second away and he never came and there's nobody you can talk to on Uber eats it's all a automated service like I said they're getting very unprofessional never had any issues with them and now I'm having all theses issues.
580,"Nine times out of ten, you'll receive your meal lukewarm."
580,"Unlike most food delivery services, Uber Eats does not require an insulated delivery bag."
580,"It is only a suggestion, but ultimately up to the driver."
580,This is a major food safety issue...You should also make sure you're alright with giving your driver either a thumbs up or thumbs down.
580,"There is no way to rate specific aspects of the meal, star amounts, or even provide a description."
580,Drivers who have an interest in improving their delivery quality have no clue how to do so without feedback.
580,"..Theres also increased charges, more than the usual rate of the restaurant if you were to order directly."
580,A $14 meal cost nearly twice as much after all the fees.
580,"You need to stay vigilant because if youre not careful, they will take money out from under you...Lastly, if you have an issue with an order, just consider it a loss."
580,"Customer service will only feed you pre-written lines, sometimes giving you 'help' that doesn't even apply to your issue."
580,And thats if they even choose to respond.
580,"..I tried uber eats once before, and only tried it again so i could use some of my uber rewards."
580,Yeah.. Not doing that again.
580,"Order directly through the restaurant if they offer delivery, and if not, use anything BUT uber eats."
586,I used to order on the app and had much better luck receiving food in a decent time.
586,"Now, I have come to expect cold food arriving moments before, or even after the maximum time suggested."
586,This is still the case if I've paid more for a direct delivery.
586,"It could be driver related, but I don't believe that is the case."
586,The app asks you to tip in advance on the total amount including taxes and fees versus the order itself.
586,"If the app is set up to tip just like the Uber drivers taking passengers, maybe Uber would realize a change should be made to their process."
586,I'm frustrated when I give a decent tip at the beginning and get a cold and nearly late food order nearly every time.
586,I've stopped using Uber Eats when I'm hungry or in somewhat of a time crunch.
590,"Simply, the Uber Eats application told me that my order was ready for pickup."
590,"I drove to grab my food, and when I arrived the restaurant told me that the chicken for my order wasn't even thawed out."
590,I was frustrated and canceled my order because the food was nowhere close to being ready.
590,When I contacted support regarding the issue they refused to give me a refund even though I recieved no food or service.
590,$40 they stole from me after lying to me about my order being ready.
590,I will never use Eats or any Uber service again because of how appalled I was at the lack of customer service regarding this issue.
590,"I had been an active Uber customer for 8 years, and even paid for their premium service Uber One."
590,"It is clear this company doesn't care at all about their customer's satisfaction, and are happy to steal from the common people rather than do right  by a customer."
597,"This app has fallen a very long way, it is no longer good anymore, most likely due to its drivers."
597,"Unprofessional, Food is always cold, Price is taxed by Uber a massive amount for example a 20$ burger will be charged for a 10$ delivery fee plus taxes, and it could be right around the corner but you can't make it due to some health problems or children."
597,"This order would come out to 50$… Not only that, They tell you an ETA but food doesn't arrive for 2 hours later even when it says being picked up or on the way without stops."
597,"This app is no longer good and is a vampire to money, use DoorDash or get the food yourself."
597,"App has too many issues, drivers smell like weed and smoke, untrust worthy."
597,"Safety is not important, food is always smashed or spilled."
597,"Restaurants do not secure your food safely, poisoning for food has happened and drugged."
597,I high advise not to use Uber eats anymore.
609,Once the delivery driver delivered my order i went out to grab it.
609,"She comes back up the stairs and tried to convince me that the order was poorly packaged at the restaurant; However, I seen sauce all on her fingers in which I asked her about; She stated that she was trying to fix the packaging of the order."
609,I took the order inside and it was hair all over the food.
609,"As well as, on the outside of the box."
609,"Also, sauce everywhere!"
609,All on the straws and all over the food boxes!
609,"I contacted support 2x and received poor service stating that they couldn't refund me, because I have multiple refunds on my account, so, refunds are currently blocked."
609,"So, I'm out of food and money due to Uber Eats, I'm deleting this app and looking into a lawsuit, because who expects someone to eat food that was probably touched due to her having sauce on her fingers and hair all over the food!"
615,So naturally since Uber and Uber eats is like a bigger brand name I expected them to be more expensive than doordash so we've always used doordash but they constantly get our orders wrong and we like super rarely used apps like these but we had covid so we used Uber eats with the Uber one feature and it's been cheaper and our orders have been right both times and it was super fast!
615,I'm not sure if it's the actual app's format on the employee side that makes Uber eats easier to navigate or what exactly it is but I actually would recommend Uber eats over DD.
617,I use Uber Eats every day!
617,I live in Manhattan and work from home the majority of the time.
617,This has been a life saver for me during the pandemic as well.
617,"The only problem with it is that I don't know if I have ordered from a restaurant before without tapping on the restaurant to see the menu and seeing the ""Order Again"" section."
617,"Yes, I use this so much that I have forgotten past orders from over a year ago."
617,I would LOVE a filter that allows me to see ONLY restaurants that I haven't ordered from before.
617,PLEASE add this.
617,"Not to mention, other delivery apps don't have this feature, so it would be unique."
617,This would allow me to try new places without having to go one by one through them.
619,"Uber Eats customer service and delivery is overpriced and horrible...Our estimated arrival time and ""latest arrival times"" kept changing further and further back."
619,"We finally contacted customer service, who apologized for our order being delayed, and offered to cancel it or at least partial refund...Then the system kicked us out."
619,"Delivery guy chose to pick up an extra delivery even though the delivery was listed as delayed, didn't show up for another 20 minutes, and the pizza was cold...On hold the entire time to reconnect to an agent...First thing from the new agent ""Sorry for the wait, our system keeps rebooting""...so he knows it's kicking people out...Despite that, he then says ""The pizza arrived when it was supposed to."
619,I'm sorry it's cold but in accorance with our policy it is not eligible for a refund.
619,"""..When I told him we were in the middle of being refunded by ""Dennis"" the first customer service agent, he said ""Nope, that's not possible."""
619,And hung up on us...Waiting 2 hours for cold pizza to arrive and then being treated this badly--I'm baffled by their high rating here on Apple apps--their Facebook rating is in the one-star.
619,We won't be ordering with them again.
620,Uber eats has a ridiculous policy where you must tip before you receive your food.
620,They no longer give you the option to change the tip after you receive the food.
620,The only purpose of tipping is to reward good service.
620,"But if the service is bad, you cannot change the tip."
620,This is absurd.
620,If you don't tip when you place the order it is likely that no Uber eats driver will pick it up.
620,This is because they are able to choose jobs based off of the tip amount.
620,This results in an obscene amount of wasted food being thrown out because it was not delivered.
620,This also hurts Uber because customers demand cash back.
620,I have no clue why Uber eats would implement this policy.
620,Tips are meant to reward good service.
620,You can't anticipate whether your service will be good or not.
620,Please revert this Uber.
620,Allow editing tips again.
626,Last weekend I ordered $105 dollars worth of pasta from Jonny Carinos.
626,My Uber eats person looked a little confused when she delivered my food to a neighboring resident.
626,I tried calling her repeatedly and that didn't work because there's no direct communication on this sorry app.
626,"Then I tried ""support"" and told them what happened."
626,"It took a really long to to arrive to the resolution of be getting a ""refund""."
626,They said 3-5 days later and it should go back on my card.
626,We are at day 5 and nothing was put back on my card.
626,I got nothing saying that I would even get a refund.
626,I'm never going to use this app again for food.
626,DoorDash is better anyway and they don't scam you out of money.
626,I'm still waiting for my money.
626,They give no way to make any further communication to let them know I have yet to receive my money back.
629,The title of my review says it all.
629,I got dinged for something recently and Customer Service said.
629,"""due to the number of refunds we have given you you are not eligible for a refund in this order."""
629,"I replied back…"" I never asked for a full refund for anything that went wrong with any of my orders."
629,If one item was wrong out of seven I would just ask you to refund that one order or something to correct it.
629,That is Uber‘s policy and fault to refund the entire amount of the order for one thing gone wrong.
629,"Do not put that on me I never asked for a full refund any of the times my orders were wrong...Uber eats, do better."
629,"My God, it's not that difficult."
637,Hello!
637,I've ordered on Uber eats twice before the incident took place.
637,"No issues, everything came great, was super happy."
637,THEN the other day (November 18th) my boyfriend and I were trying to order brunch only to receive a message 2 hours later that it was canceled and I wouldn't be given a refund.
637,I was really upset because that was a 51 dollar order and if the restaurant canceled it then I should be given a refund.
637,I spoke to 5 different support members who all claimed that I had requested money back in the past and that I had reached my maximum amount of requests.
637,We then called support instead of the messages we were doing before and they told me I was no longer allowed to use Uber eats and that I was locked out for requesting a refund.
637,".Don't let them scam you, it's not worth it."
643,"I ordered from restaurant near my house under a buy 1, get 1 free."
643,It was terrible.
643,Only one entree was delivered.
643,I called the restaurant because even though Uber eats is who we order through we still have to deal with merchant.
643,"Fine, I played along and restaurant said Uber eats is having glitches."
643,To please contact them so they could cancel order and re- order to ensure no issues/glitches occurred.
643,It's a mom/pop restaurant so I obliged— Uber eats said oh we are having issues but this error is on the merchants fault.
643,Whatttt?
643,So this is how they get you.
643,Super taking advantage of these tiny mom/pop spots blaming them for their glitches and errors.
643,Terrible.
643,Don't order.
643,Between the extra fees and how much they charge from their merchants (restaurants) just order direct!
648,"Out of ALL the delivery/pick up companies their are out there, UBER EATS, has the competition whipped on customer service, deliveries, promptness, neatness of food presentation from driving with it, courtesy to customers on presenting the delivery, down to even sending out a questionnaire/survey asking if all went well with the service that they provided to you."
648,A company asking for feedback after delivering food?!
648,"That's real risky, but UBER EATS…you've got the gumption to do so, because you believe in 100% CUSTOMER SATISFACTION!!"
648,Even giving out refunds if merited…Thanks for being that STAND UP # 1 FOOD DELIVERY COMPANY!
648,!.U B E R.   E A T S !
648,!
649,They said because it said delivered they can't do nothing about it and then that same day I ordered from Winn Dixie using Uber eats and the driver forgot to bring give me a bag full of my stuff then they also said because it said delivered they can't do anything about it.
649,So I'm paying a hand full of money for something not receiving what I paid for that is illegal!!!!
649,I literally use Uber eats everyday twice or three times sometimes and lately they have been not doing there job then not fixing what they allow there drivers to mess up and steal and lie or whatever the matter is!
649,Im a Uber one never and best believe that membership is getting canceled and I will be going to a different delivery company !
649,!!!!!
649,Would this be a case I should bring to small claims court ?
649,?
649,??
655,"My experience with this app in the Chesapeake, VA area is that many restaurants simply don't partner with Uber Eats."
655,The restaurants that do end up charging a hefty delivery fee or cancel orders.
655,"This has led to, at times, everyone picking a restaurant, each person going through the menu, placing the order, having it cancelled (or getting a pop up halfway through the order that the restaurant is ‘no longer available'); just to have to go through the whole process again."
655,"Generally, you don't pick a delivery option for dinner until your already close to dinner time."
655,"It's not just a waste of time, it's exceptionally frustrating and puts a hungry family in the position of scrambling to then come up with a dinner option that will actually be available."
656,I can trust a restaurant way more if I can tell their photos are authentic.
656,ALMOST EVERY TIME I'll check yelp reviews and photos before buying Uber eats.
656,Have you ever thought of partnering with yelp?
656,Seeing REAL authentic food pics makes me want to get the food way more- if it looks good.
656,Also I almost always come back for the 40% off promos cause it feels way cheaper and convenient then eating out.
656,I got a full Thai meal for myself and my roommate for 27$ and that's really good.
656,But yeah if there were REAL photos from REAL people in Uber eats I'd trust it a lot more and wouldn't switch between apps.
659,There have been 3 instances in which my food delivery has been late by over 1-2 hours / didn't arrive.
659,The customer service afterwards was dreadful.
659,"One order from Prince St Pizza was late by 2+ hours after pick up by the driver, who ultimately cancelled."
659,Uber eats gave me a refund on the food and a $5 credit… not sure how that's supposed to help when I'd been waiting for food to feed 6 people and it'd been that late.
659,2 other orders were late by over an hour.
659,"..Before ordering from a restaurant, I look at the arrival estimates."
659,"If I knew that they'd be much later (I'm talking hours) than expected, then I wouldn't have ordered from there at all."
659,They need to do better about getting estimates from other customers and actually factoring that in.
664,Uber eats charged me $85 for cancelation.
664,I placed an order and cancelled it 20 seconds later because I wanted to change my method  of payment.
664,I cancelled it and placed the order again  with the method of payment I wanted to use.
664,"They delivered the order and everything seemed to be okay, but one day later I cheked my bank account and realized they charged me $85 for cancellation."
664,I call them and they said I should have read all uber eats  policies(you know the small tricky letters) so be carful while using this service.
666,I've been a very loyal Uber Eats customer for the past few years.
666,"A couple nights ago, I ordered food, and one of the items had a very long hair in it."
666,Absolutely disgusting.
666,I wound up throwing away the whole order because of how unsanitary that is.
666,"I contacted Uber Eats customer service, and they refunded me for the one item that had the hair in it, $7 of a $40 order."
666,"I have messaged them 5 times requesting the full refund since I had to throw the food out, and they tell me it's their policy to work with the restaurants to resolve food safety issues and won't refund the rest of the order."
666,..I am done with Uber Eats after such terrible service.
666,I paid for food that was thrown away.
666,A full refund should have happened immediately.
670,"They're competing with DoorDash's ""ability to add to your order with a $0 delivery fee"" but the weird thing is that DD has your deliverer pickup both orders."
670,"Uber Eats hires a totally other person, so you're left waiting for the second part to your order and probably not paying the other guy as much since you tip differently when its combined vs two individual orders assuming its the same person."
670,"Like on DD I would add to my already placed tip, as a bonus."
670,"With UE, you have to tip completely separate people."
670,"Its just a weird method and I wish they clarified that so the first few times I used that extended service, I tipped correctly and don't waiting confused for the second half."
671,I showed up at the same time Uber eats alerted me that the order was sent to the restaurant bc I was paranoid it would be done on time.
671,"When I got there, they had not received it."
671,Luckily they agreed to get stated on the list I had from the app.
671,15 mins later they still did not have the order and didn't get it until o reached out to help to have it pushed through.
671,Terrible customer service from Uber eats.
671,You are literally telling me it was sent when it wasn't.
671,The first thing offer d to me from help desk was to just cancel the order but I needed this food for a business meeting with our ceos.
671,Horrible all around Uber experience.
671,Thankfully the restaurant was able to come through.
677,"I placed an order for breakfast while at work, I even paid for it to be Priority."
677,I get a message saying my order is being delivered on a bicycle.
677,and then a message to rate me order ?
677,"i never revived my order, and never received a message if it was left somewhere."
677,The phone number keep going to voicemail.
677,I am upset that I waited so long and never even received my food.
677,Now I have to go and do the process over and I have a health condidtion that needs food at certain times.
677,Totally disappointed with Uber Eats Drivers.
677,"and it's not about the refund, i needed food, not my money back."
684,My coworkers and I have ordered twice with Uber Eats once in July and once in November(today).
684,Both times we paid for priority delivery and the orders have shown up well past the window.
684,"It took over 2 hours for the first ordered, and for the one today, the restaurant hadn't even finished preparing the other when the ""priority"" time expired."
684,"So, we either need to work with our restaurants to make sure they are following your estimates, you update your estimates so we know if you are actually going to make it her on time make it more of a ""deadline"", or you just quit taking everyone's money for priority delivery because it especially seems like a scam."
686,"I always order from uber eats and never had a problem, except for a few days ago."
686,"I ordered $40 worth of qdoba food and I realized I was missing an item, I then cancelled my order which was 2 mins after realizing, and then it said I was charged for cancellation."
686,Today I contacted an agent and they told me due to their policy I couldn't get a refund.
686,"Also after I canceled my order I ordered more food and then when it came, I was missing an item, I called the person who delivered it multiple times and she never  answered I also called qdoba and they couldn't do anything about it."
686,I have never experienced anything like this before and I am very disappointed with my experience.
697,"Uber Eats is hands down, the best, food delivery service, and until recently, I would have given the 5-stars, but I've noticed them trying to sneak in the same outsized fees which drove me away from Doordash and Grubhub PERMANENTLY."
697,"My hope is that they don't sabotage themselves with those extra-entree-sized fees, because they usually mean the difference between me ordering via an app, or going to get my own take-out."
697,"I will never pay the same price for a delivery experience as I do for an eat-in restaurant experience, so be careful what fees you slip in there."
705,Used Uber eats often; I drive so I order Uber eats on lazy days  and it would be either a hit or miss sometimes when it comes to ordering delivery for a good deal.
705,The promotions they use to have were the best because the promo could be used at any restaurant or at least the restaurants in my area that i would normally eat.
705,Now the promotions are for places that either doesn't have a good variety of choices or the prices are 5x as more as what i would would spend normally so The promo isn't really a promo.
705,Please stop being greedy and let me choose my places to eat
709,Billed me for incorrect items.
709,I brought it up when the issue was discovered (2 days later as item was a bouquet of flowers and I ordered them for my wife while out of town).
709,Uber Eats refused to address this; said I should rate the merchant.
709,"I took it up with the credit card company, who refunded me."
709,Uber Eats billed my other credit card on file without authorization.
709,"Took up the issue with the second credit card company, who again refunded me."
709,Six months later Uber Eats billed me the incorrect amount again for the previous order.
709,Uber Eats continues to say there is nothing they can do and that I should be on the hook for paying more than 2x the purchase price of the product I received.
711,"2 hours after my friend and I were supposed to have our food delivered, we contacted our delivery driver to ask what the delay was."
711,She cancelled our order.
711,It's pretty clear that she dined and dashed.
711,"I'm sure she will be punished, but that doesn't help me."
711,"The issue is that at 9 pm, we have no food that will be delivered before 10 and uber eats policy apparently doesn't allow customer support to do more than refund the order."
711,"For our wasted time, in which the app assured us it would just take 5 minutes longer for a good hour, we got nothing besides 10 dollars in Uber eats credits."
711,It's not worth it to spend that on this app where I end up hungry and angry and eating at 10 pm.
711,Don't waste your time.
712,GOOD EVENING ACTUAL SCRATCH  THAT IT HAS BEEN A HORRIBLE 2 DAYS.
712,I REPEATEDLY TRIED TO ORDER FOOD FROM UBER EATS AS A FIRSt time customer because i have heard so many good things about uber eats but it went horribly wrong.
712,I set up an acc and tried to order food yesterday it was not working I spent the whole day trying to figure out what was going on but nothing was working I WENT THE WHOLE DAY WITHOUT EATING BECAUSE I PUT MY TIME AND ENERGY INTO TRYING TO MAKE OT WORK BUT AFTER ALL THE EFFORT IPUT IN I STILL COULDNT GET A SIMPLE MCDONALDS.
712,THE FOLLOWING DAY I WAS DETERMINED BECAUSE EVERYONE WAS SAYING THAT UBER EATS IS SO MUCH BETTER THEN DOORDASH BUT NOW IM FINDING IT HARD TO BELIEVE.
712,"I TRIED USING THE PROMOTION OF GETING BUT $20 OFF BUT I WAS SAYING IT PROMO NOT APPLIED, I HAD AN ORDER OF $25 YET IT STILL DIDNT WORK."
712,THE WHOLE ENTIRE 2DAYS IT WAS ONE PROBLEM AFTER ANOTHER THE ORDER WASNT WORK THEN MY PAYMENT WAS WORKING AND EVEN AFTER ALL THAT I STILL HAD HOPE I USED THE UBER APP AND UBER EATS APP BUT NOTHING WOULD WORK .
712,ALL I WANED WAS SOME MCDONLADS FOR ME AND MY SISTER BUT I COULDNT EVEN GET THAT I EVEN TRIED TO PAY FOR IT WITHOUT THE PROMOTIONS BUT NOTHING WOULD WORK.
712,I CANT BELIEVE THE TOP DELIVERY SERVICE HAS THIS MUCH PROBLEMS ALL I WANTED WAS SOME FOOD FOR THE PAST 2DAYS .NOW IM SITTING HERE STOMACH GROWLING AND CRYONG BECAUSE  OF  THIS .
713,Would be five stars except for one very annoying problem.
713,The app will send random notifications that are nothing more than advertisements for uber eats.
713,I want the notifications when I actually order something so that the driver can contact me if needed.
713,"But, if I forget to turn off the notifications, I will inevitably be woken up by a stupid advertisement a day or two later."
713,"Seriously uber eats, if I trust you to be able to give me notifications for the purpose of using the app as intended, please do not violate that trust by sending unwanted notifications that are nothing more than an advertisement, especially in the middle of the night or early in the morning."
717,I have been purchasing from and working with Uber Eats for over two years now.
717,"The platform and the people who work with them are seamless, and I say this both as a customer and a partner."
717,"In a pinch I am able to order food on-the-spot, and as a partner I am able to work on my own schedule, and thus far I feel like Uber treats me fairly as a partner, which is so important to me as I run and manage my own business."
717,Thanks Uber and to those who support all of us!
718,Uber eats takes way too long to deliver.
718,It does not matter if the place you are ordering from is near or far from you.
718,I have had multiple issues with the delivery time in the latest arrival.
718,Sometimes the latest arrival is an hour after I place the order that is unacceptable.
718,It is unacceptable that if I place an order at 11 AM that the latest arrival is 12:25 PM.
718,By that time my order is cold and I am upset because I have had to wait over an hour for an order that should've taken about 30 minutes to deliver to me or less.
719,I ordered a large Starbucks order so that I could get the $25 discount thing on my first order and the driver.
719,Micheal sent it to the wrong address and I called him telling him so.
719,He told me to wait till after he was done with the order he was working on and I did because I am a pleasant person and the order never showed up and I can't find a way to contact him again.
719,so I issued a refund to my Uber Eats account so I could re-order my order and no I don't get the first order discount so I can't use the money and have to spend more money if I want the same order and I'm still waiting on the first order because he said he would bring it but he never dead.
719,Very sad.
729,The app is functional / easy enough to use… but the fact the service fees are variable based on price (not number or size of items) is a rip off.
729,"Further, there is a delivery fee which is SEPARATE from the service fee, even though the descriptions would lead one to believe it covers the same thing."
729,"Worst of all, the proposed tip (starting at 20%) is on top of the delivery fee, Service fee, and tax!!"
729,Highway robbery!
729,"Lastly, I have received 3 emails for promotions in the last month- all of which when I tried to redeem I was told I'm ineligible!"
729,Then why are you targeting me?!?
729,"I could take a taxi round trip from these restaurants, and it would be less money than Uber eats!"
729,What a rip off.
733,So I understand that the convenience of ordering online and delivery can sometimes be more expensive.
733,I had found a deal for a restaurant that allowed free delivery if I spent X amount delivery at that location would be free...Well low and behold when I go to check out there is a 20+ fee attached to my order… my bill doubled because there was a lack of drivers.
733,I get that when there is a shortage of drivers you have to find some way to pull them in but tagging a 20$ fee onto a 20$ order is absolutely absurd.
733,I will not be using Uber Eats again because any company that's thinks it is appropriate to do that to their customers is not worth giving my money to.
734,During my last order The App did not work.
734,"I was not contacted either by the app, nor by phone, nor the delivery guy dared to ring the doorbell."
734,He left with my order and I was charged 64 euros.
734,I contacted the customer service which refused to refund me because they say the driver contacted me and waited 8 mn.
734,"Which is false, I dis not receive any phone call and he did not ring the doorbell, this a house!"
734,He just left with order and Uber eats think it is right to charge me not even leaving the food at the door.
734,This is an absolute scam.
734,"The wrong practices of this company are frightening, I will never order again on this app."
734,The restaurant I contacted told me it happens all the time!
740,If the restaurants you order to get your order wrong more than twice — you will not get a refund.
740,I had the misfortune of getting my order wrong more than twice over a few years and recently had an order where an item was missing and two items were butchered and made wrong.
740,Was told that it didn't matter if I had pictures of the food made wrong—that there was nothing customer support could do to bypass the limit Uber eats places on accounts who have been locked because of too many returns.
740,"I understand some people may abuse that, but I had pictures and the order was obviously wrong."
742,"If you held your drivers accountable for food missing from orders, you might have less of it!"
742,They know the Company will refund you so this allows them to continue to do this!!
742,Stop putting the tips first…it shouldn't prompt you to tip until after your food is delivered!
742,I know you can change it later but that doesn't always go well.
742,It took me a couple hours to find out that the driver took my food and by then it was too late to change the tip!
742,I encourage anyone who has an issues with their order to start returning ALL the food and get a FULL refund tip included and see if that makes Uber Eats adjust how they do business.
742,Ridiculous!!!
742,!
743,"We have been ordering for a number of years now and have always found the service quick, reliable, the food delivered hot and fresh by very friendly delivery people."
743,"Yes, there are surcharges, but that is to be expected for a superior service."
743,"And these charges aren't any much more than you pay for a tip and tax when dining out, so it all balances."
743,"We recommend Uber Eats for anybody, especially families."
743,Kudos to a great service.
746,I had been a fervent user of this app for at least 2 years.
746,I placed an order on 9/21 and the driver stole my food.
746,"I contacted representative Himanshu that same day at 7:23pm to refund my entire order, and found that the tip had gone through and was taken out of my refund the next morning."
746,"I spoke with representative Kurt at 7:24am, who states I should have edited my tip up to an hour after my refund…when I desperately tried to already, multiple times, and the godforsaken app wouldn't let me."
746,"So thanks, Uber Eats, you paid a driver who stole my food with my own money and I hope you keep this up!"
746,"Lose all of your customers, who cares, I will never use you again."
756,Ordering church's for my mother in laws birthday.
756,"Scheduled the order for 5:30PM, but after I paid, the order set for immediate processing."
756,..I went into the help menu to change the time but there was no option.
756,I went through the menu and selected cancel in order to state a reason.
756,I only wanted it to change the order to a later time.
756,"..However, the order cancelled and charged me a delivery fee for $13."
756,The total was $20.
756,"I contacted customer service but they told me since you cancelled it, you were charged the fee."
756,"I explained to them the app malfunctioning as well as the lack of an option to change the time, but they insisted that there was nothing I could do...I am extremely disappointed by the accountability of Uber eats and will not use their service again."
756,DoorDash has never been an issue for me and I only tired Uber eats because of a 50% promotion.
756,"But now I know, you get what you pay for."
756,"And in Uber eats case, you also pay for what you don't get."
758,I've been using Uber eats for awhile now and I recently upgraded to their premium service (I forget what they call it) where I pay a fee up front and my delivery fees are waived.
758,I still tip (as one should) but I'm really enjoying the savings and the service.
758,I'm on the road all the time and the easy to use app is a blessing.
758,"At this point I say ""so far, so good""."
758,"You've got a good thing going, don't stop evolving and getting better."
758,Thx!
761,"While notifications are needed for updates about actual food orders, this app uses your permission to enable those notifications to also constantly advertise and solicit when the app is not in use."
761,Highly inappropriate.
761,Update: attempting to use the app without notifications means you also won't receive any notice when Uber Eats randomly cancels an already confirmed order after the fact.
761,So it's really a lose-lose situation for you.
761,Why would I ever want to support a company that so clearly assumes all of its customers are either too stupid to realize or too distracted to care that they're blatantly being taken advantage of?
766,Uber eats is just a cash grab now.
766,They want you to pay extra or else they front load orders in front of your delivery so you get cold and soggy food.
766,The delivery fees and taxes are crazy high.
766,Sometimes $10 or more on a $25 order.
766,"After the tip, delivery fee and taxes you're paying double the price for your food than what's advertised."
766,Also the orders are almost always ridiculously late.
766,Sometimes more than an hour after what it predicts.
766,Then when it gets there on time or a little earlier than predicted they send you a notification to tip more because it's early.
766,It's only worth ordering if you're stuck without a car or can't drive.
767,I got a new phone and tried to sign into Uber Eats.
767,I had the correct phone number and email but Uber told me my password was incorrect.
767,I tried to send a recovery email and spent the next 20 minutes infuriatingly trying many things.
767,Nothing worked.
767,Then I realized I might have created the account via Google's sign on originally.
767,"..So I tried to sign on via google, and it all worked."
767,"Uber, maybe you should at least try to show a helpful error message in cases where a user tries to send a recovery email to an account that was created with Google/FB/etc."
767,single sign on….this was 20 minutes of my life that I can never get back
772,After a horrible food experience and using Uber eats for my first time ever..
772,I had ordered my food and it was so burnt and hard that I couldn't eat it.
772,"So I wrote Uber, didn't hear back right away."
772,Threw the disgusting wasted food away and ended up getting an email to take a picture as PROOF after I had already threw the food away and was not going to be able to pick each piece of chicken out of the garbage.
772,"I also found out I had COVID this exact day and to have this be my first experience and now Uber tell me .. no picture, no refund!?!?"
772,I will never use Uber again and will spread the word.
772,You guys should care more about your customers.
772,Wow!!!!!
772,!
774,Placed an order on Uber eats and the order did not arrive.
774,After waiting quite some time.
774,We place the order again.
774,And a different driver brought the food.
774,"Even after getting a refund for a non-delivery, I was still charged for a tip for the driver who never showed."
774,"After contacting Uber eats support, they tell me I had to remove the tip within one hour of the order for it not to be charged."
774,"we waited on our food for over an hour and a half and finally received it, however, the first driver was tipped for doing nothing."
774,Uber eats would not refund the tip.
774,"if the order is not delivered, and a refund is issued, then why is a tip still allowed?"
775,"I have issues with almost every order I place on Uber eats, and always have my time wasted with no compensation."
775,"Repeatedly I will pay high fees for the delivery just to receive my product 15+ minutes later than promised, usually up to 45 if I receive my items at all."
775,I have had to cancel a shocking amount of orders myself because delivery drivers will show up to the restaurant and not let me know there were issues with my order.
775,I have grown more and more disappointed as I have continued to give this app chances.
775,Never again.
781,"""Taxes and other"" fees is the biggest robbery ever."
781,Y'all wanna make more money stop low-balling the drivers and customers.
781,"I can't give somebody a $5-10 tip after paying for my food, the delivery fee, AND ""taxes and other"" fees."
781,"Also instead of sending me 40% discounts every week on places I've never eaten and never will, what would it hurt to give me that same 40% off the few I actually order from."
781,Uber one is completely useless.
781,"""Free delivery on eligible stores"", but it doesn't tell you all which stores(not that you have many to pick from) I love Uber eats delivery times and communication between drivers but everything else outweighs it all."
782,"One thing I noticed, is Uber Eats charges significantly more compared to DoorDash."
782,"Be that as it may, I decided to order via Uber Eats anyways."
782,"After getting my food it gave me an option to edit my tip, so I tried to change it from $5 to $10."
782,"Instead, it ADDED both and made it $15."
782,"I spoke with support TWICE and both time they claimed a ""specialized"" team must address this and closed the chat on me."
782,"I then get an email with OUTDATED instructions claiming I can manually change the tip, which USED to be the case but now it ONLY lets me add."
782,I have not received follow up and will only use DoorDash for now on.
782,Better prices for the SAME THING and more selections.
791,The order always takes much much longer than the estimate.
791,"The app pays almost nothing to the drivers so they have to take 2 orders in order to make money, that makes your order take double the time to arrive."
791,The food gets cold by then!
791,..Several times the delivery guy took my food and i recieved no solutions from the support team.
791,I didnt even get the chance to rate the delivery guy.
791,So obviously he's going to keep stealing the deliverys and uber eats is going to keep making millions at the expense of my cold food and the delivery guys salaries.
791,..You guys could be doing so much better.
791,Its a shame
796,Be careful because the app will mess up and tell you your order has been cancelled by the restaurant when it hasn't and you will have issues of trying to cancel an order if you try to get your order from another restaurant.
796,They do not refund you even if it is the apps fault.
796,"The customer service reps are rude, and they lie when saying they will have their supervisor get back to you just to get you off the call."
796,So disheartening when you have been a loyal customer.
796,Also you can't delete the Uber eats account and keep your Uber account as they are combined.
799,"Their app wouldn't let me submit orders, then it finally sent it through minutes later after I changed my mind..They tried to charge me $40 to cancel so I called..First team escalated to a manager after arguing with me and blaming me for the issue..Manager picks up, hears me, and then hangs up..I call again and ask to escalate to a manager..I was told that's not how they structured their calls..I told them that's a lie, as it just happened to me..Customer service tried to threaten me by saying these calls are recorded ..I asked them to simply refund my order as the app clearly glitched..I was told I needed to pay $40..I hung up, got my delicious food, disputed the charge with my bank and won my refund..It costs Uber Eats 0 dollars to refund, since they don't technically own these restaurants."
799,"Greed kept them from refunding me so I had to get my money back the hard way ..I am never using Uber again, only Doordash and Lyft from now on"
802,I used to be an avid Uber eats user.
802,The Uber one program offers great benefits a good amount of the time.
802,"Recently, this app has been impossibly terrible in their customer service."
802,"I ordered groceries from Target today, and not only did my order lose over half of its original amount of stuff, I was charged for things I didn't receive."
802,"I've been in contact with support, but they continually claim due to system limitations they are unable to process charge adjustments even when I'm showing them proof of my receipt."
802,"..I'm done, and I will be finding a new delivery app to use from now on."
802,Figure it out Uber.
810,I downloaded uber eats and I got an email with a 25 dollar coupon for my first order.
810,I decided to give it a try.
810,I placed my order at Denny's I was charged for the order and I got the wrong order.
810,"I returned the order back to the driver, I called Denny's and the manager told me they never received the order from Uber eats."
810,There was no customer service number where I could call I could only send a message.
810,I wasted an hour trying to fix this problem.
810,I finally got an email saying I will get a refund.
810,What about all the hassle I was out through???
810,Horrible experience I will never use this app again.
817,Never received 2 milkshakes they refunded me for one of them but there was no option to explain I ordered 2 even though it was on the receipt!!
817,every time I tried to report there was another item missing I just kept getting the same message that I'd already been refunded the entire amount of the order of 8.65$ lol the order was 65$ 8$ was the amount of the one milkshake so not only did I not get my shakes I still had to pay for them and no one even offered to go get 2 more for me no.
817,This isn't the first issue I've had with Uber Eats but it will be the last
820,Been using grubhub cause Uber eats was way expensive a year or two ago.
820,"Now the delivery fee is 4$, the base prices seem lower, you can pay for 2$ faster delivery if you want."
820,I might just use it regularly and not have a subscription to a service anymore.
820,4$ is reasonable and I won't feel obligated to use it more because of the membership
826,I've had very good luck with using Uber eats.
826,I don't use it very often but when I do always have a good experience and I always end up saving money overall.
826,If you're not privy to using UberEats download the app check it out see what's available see what kind of deals you can get it's definitely worth it!
835,"The support provided for Uber Eats Mexico is horrible: -They are extremely lazy -They don't read the information provided -They ignore screenshot provided -They're not customer oriented -If you request a manager, they ignore your request and close the ticket -They copy and paste irrelevant answers instead of reading the new notes -There is no way to call and escalate your case, it's all over the app or nothing -They reject cases even when you prove them wrong -They don't solve any problems and close the case without the customer approval -They should be fired and get the proper agents, that use the rules from Uber USA"
839,"The very first order I ever made with Uber Eats was picked up, but never delivered."
839,"The driver took another pick up, got confused and was trying to deliver my food to their next pickup."
839,"When I called they asked me to send them my address, and they would bring me my food."
839,"Then after noticing my order showed delivered on the app I contacted the driver, and they told me my order cancelled."
839,"Uber customer service did refund me, but that was still a very bad experience."
839,"My kids were waiting to eat, and it was getting late."
839,"I think I'll stick to picking up, or using a more reputable delivery service."
841,Hi I'm Ed and that is a great question.
841,Uber eats is so expensive to use.
841,"It's a great idea but the app charges you for the item you want, and Jen it charges you again for item size."
841,The after you have been up charged several times and here's an incredible tax charge applied to the tally.
841,Completely starting to reconsider the need to use such an app.
848,I ordered Popeyes at 12:20 pm.
848,They showed that my order was ready right away.
848,So I drove to the Popeyes.
848,But was told that my order is not ready.
848,I contacted Uber eats customer at 1:10pm.
848,Told them them at their status of order is wrong and I've been in the store for more than 20 mins and my order is still not ready.
848,All they did was told me that sorry but I have to wait till 1:20pm to contact them again….
848,And then they dropped thre conversation after I didn't respond in 30s…..1.
848,Why would an order of 12 pieces of chicken take one hour?
848,I see all other orders got ready and picked up during the 40 mins wait.
848,..2.
848,Why fake the order status when it's not ready?
848,I could stay at home without wasting 40 mins in waiting.
848,..3.
848,Why don't you show us that the max wait time is one hour for 12 pieces of chicken?
848,"If you show this info to me, I would not order them at the first place."
852,"I keep getting charged $9.99 every month from Uber eats, so I tried to close me account or delete it and I can't find that option anywhere."
852,If there is one it should be easily accessible not hidden or have some page to direct me (and I use a mobile device).
852,"So I went to customer service and started a chat, I had to leave my phone for something really quick."
852,I came back only four minutes later and the guy said I have been unresponsive for too long.
852,All I want to do is get them to stop charging my card.
859,I find it beyond frustrating how inaccurate information is on here.
859,While leaving an event we ordered food at 12:00am (midnight) expecting it to arrive around 12:45am.
859,The delivery time got pushed back twice and then around 1:15am our order was canceled.
859,We found out it's because the restaurant closed at 10:00pm.
859,By the time we found that out all of the restaurants near us closed at 1:30am and we weren't going to order at the last minute.
859,It seems like we are in a constant battle of dealing with annoying issues like this with Uber eats.
861,I ordered food yesterday to be delivered to the local business.
861,"Delivery was marked as delivered However, food was never delivered to the address on the order."
861,I was told it was dropped off at remote location.
861,"However, no one was able to tell me what the remote location is."
861,I was told that the driver was not able to be contacted.
861,I was charged for the order and never received the food.
861,Uber eats was NOT able to refund me the order as it was marked as complete.
861,no one is willing or able to assist as everything is done through chat.
861,Bad customer service.
885,I got finessed by a customer service agent.
885,After waiting an extra hour after my food was ready.
885,I was offered 20 percent partial refund in Uber Eats credits.
885,I did not want credits because I decided I didn't want to use Uber Eats service again.
885,"So I asked instead of receiving credits, I asked for that 20 percent refunded to my original form of payment instead."
885,They told me I could after I receive my order and that I wait until my order was completed.
885,I followed up with customer service and they said I couldn't get anything at all!
885,Finessed..
897,"Here's how I've manage to get over $200 a day for driving just 5-6 hours:..When you get a notification from Uber, check at the amount you will be receiving for the delivery."
897,"..If the offer is below $10, do yourself a favor and do NOT accept!!!!"
897,"This is their way to cheat you out on a good offer...What will end up happening is that they will increase the amount of $$$...When no one accepts the small amount of $$$ Uber or the buyer of the food will be forced to increase the amount of the offer...When everyone follows this rule of thumb, everyone doing deliveries will be expecting a higher pay."
897,..Or else Uber eats will go broke...Moral to the story?..Don't say yes to everything...Know your worth ( your time and efforts ).And stick to it...Let's go ahead and make this paper!!
897,$$$$$
909,So I made an order to a restaurant and the food was delivered however the food I received was not what I ordered.
909,I paid thru PayPal so PayPal informed me they spoke to Uber Eats and a refund was approved and my case was found in my favor.
909,"Now, Uber Eats is saying I owe them the money and won't correct it even after speaking with customer service and being escalated."
909,AB's it won't even allow me to delete my account saying I owe them.
909,"I even sent them the emails, Photos and screenshots."
909,I want my account cleared as that is an error or I want it deleted and canceled.
912,I placed an order last month at work for Coffee/Tea to be delivered to my Co-workers and I; one of the Chail Lattes was not to order.
912,"Uber Eats said I'd be credited $5 for the error, which I saw post to my account the same day."
912,".The following day my account only showed $1.43 credit, no $5; no return reply from the Company when I sent a message to UE."
912,I'm canceling unless they can make good on their word.
912,Be aware!
915,Uber eats is capping off all refunds wether it's their fault or not.
915,Drivers deliver to wrong place and not held accountable.
915,Orders not complete.
915,And then they won't refund or send another order to you.
915,PLEASE HELP STOP THIS SCAM!
915,Delete app and leave bad review on google play or App Store.
915,This company is stealing money from you!
915,Up charging all products by double and you will not get your order full 90% of the time and now will not get refunded.
915,Total scam use any other delivery app there are a bunch more that actually care about the customer!
917,"I order my Uber food and then find out afterwards that the driver is unable to deliver it, but I still get charged the amount for the food so it like a free meal to the driver because they are unable to deliver to my location so I can't even get the food, and when I contact customer service about it, they are unable to give me a refund, and they all say the same thing to me, and one even hung up before even trying to resolve the issue."
917,Overall this is the last time I'm using Uber eats or Uber.
919,Multiple times I have ordered food then waited greater than 30 minutes over the estimated time.
919,Eventually my food gets cancelled.
919,Uber says it's because of a lack of drivers.
919,However I watch my assigned person pick up my food or circle around the restaurant for an extended period of time until it cancels.
919,Uber offers no solution or help in these situations.
919,If you can't fulfill the service you offer then don't offer it.
919,After multiple experiences like this I will no longer be using uber eats or uber.
928,"hello, I find it hard to use Uber eats."
928,"The last three orders that have received arrived cold, or with bad food quality."
928,The first time this happened.
928,I chalked it up to a bad experience.
928,The second two times it happened.
928,I immediately reported to  Uber eats does nothing about it.
928,I am not even sure if they notified the Resturant.
928,..I  am disappointed in the customer service for Uber eats.
928,"They should require restaurants to serve, high-quality warm food, even if it is for delivery."
942,I love Uber Eats.
942,The app is easy to navigate and as always Uber and Uber Eats is all about customer service.
942,This makes any occasion easy when you need a last minute meal delivered right to you and if there is a legitimate problem with your order they take care of it quick and easy.
944,I am so thankful for Uber eats and they have a dedicated new customer because they are the only delivery service running right now.
944,"We are slammed at work, people need us right now, but I need to feed my employees."
944,Now I'm home and exhausted.
944,Thank you Uber Eats!!!
944,I'll reach for you first now!
952,They charge you an extra 1.5 on every menu item while charging you additional fees.
952,"You can get a $0 delivery fee but get charged $14 in additional fees, it's happened to me before."
952,I also just spent an hour trying to order myself a meal while giving my kid a bath.
952,Order never went through.
952,"Tried again, same thing, called the restaurant said it's an Uber eats issue."
952,Will never use again.
952,"Avoid this scam at all cost, cook from home."
952,I do a meal kit plan and it's saved me $300 a month.
952,Uber eats is a scam.
956,Both this company and app are a complete joke.
956,They take 0 accountability both on the customer and worker side.
956,Undeniably screwing over both parties simultaneously for their own profits.
956,"Only on Uber eats can I have 3 straight food orders in a row not be delivered and told it is my fault, no refund and I need to do the work to contact the driver and see what could have been done better."
956,That is an absolute joke and laughable approach to customer service.
956,You guys need to step it up because in your current state your business is trash.
966,Ordered from a local favorite.
966,Menu was consistent with the menu currently being offered in the restaurant.
966,Delivery estimated at 50 min.
966,"After 1.5 hours, I called the restaurant (because Uber is impossible to contact), and was informed that that restaurant not only doesn't work with Uber Eats - it never has."
966,The manager was very surprised to learn their menu was listed and of Uber's charging for their food.
966,Any trust in this app has been lost.
966,Multiple attempts to contact Uber Eats was met with robots unable to help.
967,This app is such a joke lately.
967,.The communication is so far below what should be ethically acceptable to be considered a business.
967,.REPEATED cancelled orders where the DRIVER now has a hot meal for themselves.
967,"No responsibility for the people THEY HAVE DRIVING FOR THEM, that they ""hire""."
967,".Wasted time again and again, orders cancelled after an hour wait when delivery is scheduled for 10 minutes or less."
967,".Or better yet, turfed to FOUR different drivers because the first TOOK the food for themselves and then left the app."
967,Assigned to next driver.
967,And so on.
967,.Uber eats and Uber have lost Uber One/Gold (or whatever crap they call it) users/subscribers.
967,"..Waste of time and money and resources, restaurants fed up with it as well, offering to REMAKE it for a discount because they physically handed to it to, in the case of tonight, Brian."
967,Two minutes prior to our inquiry.
967,..✌🏻
969,Free 30 day Uber eats is NOT worth it!
969,"Cancelled via email before offer ended because there is no way to unsubscribe in the app - no link, no options to get out."
969,"Customer service basically threatened for disputing fees added AFTER cancellation that ""you shouldn't have disputed"" and then blocked Uber rides, which had been separate from Eats."
969,All but one driver was creepy and stalkerish.
969,Horrible customer service - they won't let you leave and add extortion fees when you try to.
969,Not worth it!
973,Overall I like the app add its ease of use.
973,I don't like how Uber eats resolves problems with orders.
973,"They will refund the order but they won't rectify the problem, also they should modify the app so it can be viewed in landscape mode."
973,"I use my iPad more often than not because of the bigger screen, but the app is only configured for phone use."
976,I've been using DoorDash for years now.
976,I overheard a friend talk about Uber Eats.
976,I decided to download the app.
976,I am so glad that I did.
976,It is way easier to use and a lot more choices.
976,Even the promotions were better than DoorDash.
976,I am very happy and pleased with my decision.
976,You guys will probably have a forever customer now.
981,I had to enter multiple selections multiple times before it would accept my second menu item.
981,It just disappeared without any error and I had to start over.
981,Took me 15 extra minutes to get through the process.
981,I've also had problems in the past where the app menu didn't exactly match the restaurant menu.
981,"The restaurant blames Uber Eats, as they should!"
981,"Anyway, I eventually got the order placed, I hope!"
982,"After having issues with my order, I reached out to uber eats customer service and by the following morning they manage to compensate me for my order which I highly appreciate."
982,Will be returning to the app again sometime soon
985,I love using Uber eats.
985,Especially when I can't get out or just don't want to cook.
985,The only problem I have had is I've paid the extra fee for priority to be delivered straight to me and still waited past the wait time.. A lot of the time I waited past the wait time.
985,So paying for priority is pointless to me.
991,The customer service here is a joke.
991,My order was cancelled BY UBER EATS because the driver couldn't find my house.
991,The driver called me to help find the place and I gave her the best instructions I could.
991,She told me she is going to call Uber and hung up the phone.
991,"Shortly after, my order was cancelled and UBER said they were going to give me a refund."
991,I waited and the refund never came.
991,"I called Uber and they said because it's been 48 hours, they couldn't issue a refund."
991,Never got my food and they won't give me my money back.
993,I've had it for two months after years of using doordash.
993,I have had constant issues like orders being an hour or more late multiple times.
993,My order today was missing over half of the items.
993,Uber eats doesn't care at all.
993,When there is an issue with doordash like this they give you a credit or refund your entire order to make up for the inconvenience.
993,I highly recommend utilizing any other delivery service besides Uber eats.
998,"Use Uber eats like every other week, but get multiple promo notifications EVERY day...It's really annoying I can't disable it."
998,I can turn off notifications but then I can't get updates of my deliveries!
998,"Gonna give it another week, if it continues gonna delete the app and switch to Grubhub or something…  Might be less selection in my area but at least I don't get these annoying notifications all day"
1025,My first order was supposed to be 20 off and they took my promotion from me told me I can't use it!
1025,THAT IS OUTRAGEOUS!!!
1025,Why give someone something and then take it away from them?!?!
1025,Now I'm STUCK with a promotion I can't even use!!!
1025,HIGHLY UNFAIR HIGHLY UPSET HIGHLY DONT RECOMMEND THIS APP!!!
1025,UBER EATS HAS DONE THIS SAME THING TO ME AND I HAVEN'T BEEN APPRAISED FOR IT!
1025,!😕 I've send OVER HUNDREDS of dollars on Uber eats to be faked out on another app you NO BETTER THAN THEM😒 DONT GIVE SOMEONE SOMETHING AND THEN DONT ALLOW THEM TO USE IT!!
1025,!
1041,"Oh, yeah."
1041,Shouty caps bad.
1041,"..Back when Postmates was Postmates and not Uber Eats masquerading as Postmates, it was great."
1041,Ever since it changed hands it's been a nightmare.
1041,..The communication is basically zero.
1041,I waited for hours thinking my order was still coming.
1041,Only to find out (after climbing through a labyrinth on their app) there's no one around to deliver it.
1041,..How about just say so?
1041,"Just friggin tell me that when I place the order, so my kids and I aren't waiting for breakfasts that just aren't coming."
1041,I'm wheelchair-bound and can't just get up and go fetch food on the fly.
1041,It would be nice to be informed.
1041,..But cha won't.
1041,"These folks don't believe in going, ""Hey there!"
1041,Your food can't be delivered.
1041,There's just no one around to go get your order.
1041,Sorry.
1041,"🤷🏼"" ..Maybe try Doordash."
1041,Or opt for calling the restaurant directly.
1041,Just stay away from the Uber's attempt at food delivery.
1054,Have used all the delivery apps and Postmates for whatever reason just seems to deliver consistently a better product regardless of where I order.
1054,"I'll sometime see a restaurant on Uber Eats and the specifically go to Postmates so it arrives fresh, with utensils, sauces etc…great service worth the moola"
1076,"I order from here and uber eats all the time, they are the best and always consider you and your time."
1076,they are always there if you need help and they give you lots of coupons
1104,Better options for order on Postmates compared to Uber eats...Wished I could change bread type for Hawkins Burgers :/
1124,"I've had doordash for a couple of years now, but over the past couple of months it has become an incredibly frustrating experience."
1124,"When I order food for delivery, many times they'll have more than one other person to deliver before me, so I get cold food when it arrives even when the driver has thermal equipment to keep the food in."
1124,"When I order for pick up, the app gets incredibly confusing."
1124,"It constantly suggest locations to me that are not the closest, and the address for the place doesn't even show up until the check out."
1124,And then I go to my usual location thinking it's fine since I've order from those places many times before only to find out it's a whole other location I've never been to.
1124,"There are no warnings or anything to tell you this isn't the closest location when you're ordering, and if it's frustrating for a person that is used to apps, I can't imagine how infuriating it would be for more technologically challenged people."
1124,"On top of that, when restaurants have gotten my orders wrong, I'm only given a partial refund for my order even though I now have a meal I can't eat."
1124,"I originally got this app because it was cheaper than uber eats with decent service, but now the prices are about the same so I don't see a point anymore."
1124,Really disappointed.
1138,DoorDash driver decided to steal my food and go home without notifying me.
1138,"I had to work it out myself, left me and kids starving hungry."
1138,"By the time I worked it out, the restaurant had closed at 10pm."
1138,".Backstory: Me and my kids arrived home at 7:30 after being away, no food in house, ordered from DD around 8pm, waited starving and excited for food."
1138,"Read all notifications - food prepared, finally after over an hour, it said driver almost there."
1138,Kept waiting.
1138,The order was still open.
1138,I contacted the driver theough chat.
1138,"As soom as I texted, she closed the order."
1138,"By the time I complained and got refunded, the restaurant was closed."
1138,I was shaking with fury.
1138,The driver took the food and went home without a word!
1138,I used every option on DD to complain and tell them this story - to give the company a chance to repair damages in this very unhappy customer's eyes.
1138,Cuz what they did was pretty bad under the circumstances.
1138,Nothing.
1138,"No apology from customer service, no response to multiple messages of complaint, zilch!"
1138,After using the store credit that was auto-credited (not even my own money back!)
1138,I will never use them again.
1138,Every time I see the dd logo I feel that starving hangry anger of that night.
1138,Use uber eats or another alternative!
1192,So many problems with dashers.
1192,"They will take way too long to deliver in the first place leaving your food completely cold, or have other stops that leave you waiting longer than the expected wait time and when either the restaurant or dasher mess something up, deliver in the wrong place, or anything they won't give you a refund or even close to a refund."
1192,They will offer $4 ON A $40 ORDER.
1192,you have to contact the support team(that is useless 90% of the time unless you haven't had problems in the past) which will also offer you a refund that does not match what you paid for the item?
1192,So the customer is supposed to take the hit for a mistake made by either the dasher or restaurant???
1192,Does not seem correct to me.
1192,They have a lot to work on and Uber eats and other delivery services don't seem to have this problem at all.
1192,(Did I mention the prices are extremely high even if you have dAsHpA$$).
1278,As much I'm not a fan of new technologies today but in all due reality this has been amazing just like Uber eats.
1278,But DoorDash has been allot easier to use other than Uber eats.
1278,Especially for people like me who gets tired coming home from work cause I work graveyards and I do get tired to go anywhere….
1278,I give thanks to the people who is willing to deliver food and other convenience stuff.. and also along with Uber I am thankful for that technology as well to give people rides and from where ever they needed to be… I am grateful for both feature.. ..God bless you all 🙏🏽🙂
1291,This has got to be one of the worst and most pathetic app I've used!
1291,First off why have 50% discounts and not even take out 50% off your total order?!
1291,Secondly why have an app as a food delivery service when yah look severely understaffed I ordered sum not too long ago and by the time my food got there it was basically frozen solid!!!
1291,And yah really gone mean to tell me that every time I order I'm gonna have cold food cause yah struggling to look for dashers when I'm in the city as well like c'mon now it's really pathetic on yah end for real like don't have a service like this if yah gonna keep delaying my order cause yah need to look for people to deliver only to have me wait more than 2 hrs just to have someone deliver a simple order PLEASE DON'T EVER ORDER USING THIS SERVICE EVER AGAIN!!!
1291,That's why Uber eats is superior I swear bro 😒
10,I received a text saying my order was delivered by the front door.
10,I went outside.
10,It wasn't there.
10,I texted the driver asking him where he left it.
10,He says under the mailbox which didn't make much sense given where the mailroom is in my building.
10,I then described my building and asked him if that's where he left it.
10,He texts back no.
10,I asked him what address he left it at.
10,"He texts back that he doesn't have that information, and there's nothing else he can do to help me."
10,I went to the app and tried to use the chat to talk to customer service.
10,I was in a queue for a while.
10,Then someone finally joined the chat.
10,They didn't type anything or respond to anything.
10,"After 10 minutes of no response in the chat, I found the customer service number and called them."
10,"After a bit of time on hold, I finally talked to someone and explained what happened."
10,She said she would reorder it for me but didn't offer any discount or coupon or anything.
10,She didn't even really apologize.
10,I finally received my order over an hour late.
10,"No discount, no coupon, no apology, nothing!"
104,My first (yesterday) experience did not go well at all.
104,Took 2 hours for delivery.
104,It appeared the driver was overloaded with deliveries.
104,"When driver arrived, she refused to bring my order inside."
104,I'm in a wheelchair.
104,My oxygen tube will not reach the front door.
104,Driver was informed of this before she picked up the order.
104,Very disappointing service.
104,I'm going to try again today and go from there.
104,Hopefully with a different driver.
104,GrubHub has a wonderful website and I'm looking forward to continued use.
484,This literally happened:..1) I ordered food..2) App said it was delivered but food never came..3) Customer service says they contacted the driver and he dropped off food in my front door..4) They offered to refund or reorder.
484,I asked to reorder.
484,By now it's 90 mins after my initial ETA..5) Two hours have passed.
484,They cancel my order a second time saying there's a problem with the restaurant.
484,..6) All they offer is 10% discount on next order.
484,For a 2-hour wait with no food at the end of it!..7) I'm deleting this app.
484,So many options in this space.
564,Many years customer.
564,App said ordered delivered.
564,Checked door and all around my house.
564,Talked to driver.
564,"He said I delivered it, it was the house with the gravel path."
564,I said not our house.
564,I asked driver if he read the extra instructions I put in the app.
564,Driver said I never read those and then hung up or call was disconnected.
564,Called thru to driver again.
564,Straight to his VM.
564,Left message.
564,He never returned the call.
564,Texted customer support.
564,Person kept telling me it was delivered and sorry this wasn't the support decision I hoped for but nothing they could do.
564,Asked to talk to a more senior support member because this decision made no sense.
564,Same response.
564,Frustrating as can be.
564,Cost me $50.
564,2 days later our neighbor delivered to our front door.
564,Clearly he delivered somewhere else.
564,Surprised years of use and no customer support interactions like this mattered not at all.
564,Definitely done with UberEats and Uber.
564,Time to move on.
564,Something changed there in their support.
918,I cannot believe this.
918,The man that was coming to my door literally left the food outside while it was pouring down rain.
918,"Fortunately, I had the tracker app and was able to see my food outside my door."
918,I had the option of either him coming to see my door and knocking or him calling me.
918,I chose for him to knock my front door.
918,"not only did he not do that but, half of my food was missing."
918,I don't know if he took it or if he just didn't check.
918,This is unbelievable and I will never and I mean never use this app again.
1222,I genuinely despise this app.
1222,"Every time I think I'll try it again, within my first couple orders my order gets stolen by my dasher."
1222,My favorite time was when my wife was in labor at the hospital.
1222,"Finally writing a review today, because unfortunately this is the only thing I can do."
1222,It's infuriating...Ordered some breakfast today because we lost power and thought it would be nice to have some coffee.
1222,"Dasher today never arrived, never attempted contact, and kept the order."
1222,"Order was marked ""delivered""."
1222,"Customer support refunded me, but were unhelpful otherwise."
1222,"No answers, and chalked the experience up to ""our dashers are encouraged to wait, but we allow them to customize their own experience."
1222,"We know how frustrating this can be!""."
1222,"We were by our front door with the windows open the whole time, so apparently customizing their own experience means stealing the food and never arriving."
1294,"Between the up charges, the dashers who will drop your food off at the wrong house or at the driveway and not the front door and the customer service that goes through an entire script before you can get a refund for a delivery never showing up, I can't recommend this for anyone."
1294,Plus we need to get back to a lifestyle of picking up our own food rather than paying 40% more after charges and tips to have it brought to us.
1294,"On the flip side, having driven for DoorDash and Postmates in 2020 when my job was on hiatus, I can heartily encourage you to support Postmates if you must order delivery."
1294,Their drivers are treated much better and have better earning potential… and it shows cause I've never had a problem with a Postmates driver dropping food off at the door.
669,"I wish I wasn't writing this negative review, but it's gotten to the point where I need to say something."
669,"I used this app all the time when I was very sick about a year ago, and basically relied on it to get food."
669,Everything worked great… that is until I stopped paying for Uber One (for financial reasons).
669,"So far since the DAY of cancellation, every single order WITHOUT FAIL has been wrong, or something has been wrong with the app."
669,"I'm not talking about just a few orders too, I'm talking about dozens over the past 6 months, with little to no help with returns."
669,"The same thing has also been happening to my boyfriend, so I know it's not just me."
669,"This used to be my go-to app for ordering food, but now I'm heavily considering switching to Doordash."
962,Not exactly sure why this app's overall rating is so high…I see a lot of negative reviews that have 5 stars somehow 🤔 anyway this is about the worst food delivery app I've ever used.
962,Totally unreliable.
962,I've given this app more chances than it deserves.
962,Delivery always takes much longer than the given estimation or my order is randomly cancelled after waiting for an hour.
962,Which is really annoying when you're hungry and are willing to pay the astronomical prices.
962,Total trash UberEats you should be ashamed.
1307,Fantastic service.
1307,Fantastic delivery time.
1307,"But (for my order at least) it's insane that if I were to go and pick up my order myself, it would have been $10."
1307,My order with DoorDash is close to $30.
1307,Inflation has screwed all of us.
1307,"This feeds in to the memes about DoorDash that a $5 meal costs $60 hahahah Again, this is not a negative review, I am fully happy with your service, I suppose this is just a comment about the times that we are living in."
1307,"Have a wonderful evening, and I hope DoorDash lives on another day!"
66,ordered from a restaurant that is ten minutes away from my house and it took over an hour to get to my destination.
66,"while this place is popular in my area, there is no reason as to why our driver took over thirty minutes to get to the restaurant and take over forty minutes to drive to my place."
66,we attempted to reach out to the driver only to be met with an answering machine (why even have the option if it doesn't work).
66,finally got our food and it was COLD.
66,tried talking to customer service and they only offered 5$ credit for a 50$ meal per a dumb policy that does not put the customer's needs as a priority.
66,absolutely ridiculous.
66,will never be using this service again.
874,The interface for entering an address didn't show me the location on the map.
874,"I had inadvertently selected ""7100 N IH 35"" instead of ""S IH 35."""
874,I didn't see the problem until the driver picked up the food.
874,Then I IMMEDIATELY rushed to correct it.
874,But the app canceled my order when I updated the delivery address since my correct address was out of the area.
874,"Fine, okay, whatever…..Except they sent me a message saying I'd be CHARGED for the order since it was prepared...Awful user experience."
874,Even worse company.
1001,Is anyone else experiencing the map tweaking?
1001,"My orders had a different drop off place than my house, like 2 streets over."
1001,The map looks weird because it puts the black line in a different street even when I put in my correct address.
1261,Costumer service really trash and they will send you into very dangerous places and they wouldn't care  because all about there business not your life even low pay rate when you gotta do more miles then the pay and even in drop off you going to have trouble in the maps never a correct address etc.
1261,they even deactivate you if you don't accept them low balling when they know gas ain't cheap so really it's not up to you it's up the them when you should accept or not.
1261,.This is a horrible company to work for take it as that and keep it moving
1303,I ordered food tonight and it wasn't delivered to the correct address.
1303,"Not only did the customer service reps deny that my order wasn't received, but they literally went in and CHANGED my address to coincide with their story being that I had given the wrong address."
1303,"That wasn't true because I ordered the same meal the day before to the correct address and pressed ""reorder"" and confirmed my meal without making any changes."
1303,"Then, they ended the conversation when I was trying to speak with a supervisor."
1303,This company is deceitful.
1303,"I was a loyal customer for a long time and deleted my account tonight because they not only lied, but also refused to refund me my money after I didn't receive my order."
1303,Terrible customer service - the worst of them all.
52,"Waited over almost an hour for my food, saw it was delayed and got a feeling something was wrong as my food apparently hadnt even begun to be prepared."
52,"Went to cancel my order, and instead of simply letting me cancel my order they made me text with a customer service representative who I am quite certain wasn't even a real person."
52,"Found out my order had been ""rejected"" and I probably wouldnt have even known this unless I cancelled it."
52,"The only other time ive tried to use this app was months ago in July of last year, and the same thing happened."
52,"Don't touch this with a ten foot pole, and im sure im going to get a robotic response to this review begging me to change my rating like everyone else who gave a bad review."
1171,I've tried a lot of food delivery apps over the years.
1171,"They're all basically the same in my opinion, but the reason I prefer doordash over any other is because of the customer service."
1171,Sometimes issues happen with the food or the person delivering the food.
1171,That happens with every food delivery service.
1171,"But the difference is that every time I've asked for customer service help from doordash, I'm always connected to a real person who is actually perfectly reasonable and extremely helpful about what they can do to make things right for me."
1171,"Also, the ""help"" button is very easy to find."
1171,"I've found that most other apps try to hide it from you and even when you do find it, you just end up talking to a robot then maybe getting a small refund."
133,"I've used the service twice..First time food was cold and no Covid tamper deal..Second time, the guy never left my pizza."
133,I waited two hours.
133,Driver wouldn't answer phone or text.
133,He probably just drove by and ate my pizza.
133,He was sitting for 20 minutes after he picked up my pizza on the map.
133,Probably ate it and then drove by to pretend to drop it off.
133,.Wasted time with customer service both times.
133,Second time I demanded more than a refund and got a coupon.
133,Ridiculous.
133,They better hold that guy accountable.
882,"They were unable to resolve the issue of having placed an order from a convenience store for groceries, yet half of the items were missing and I still now have to go out and go grocery shopping."
882,"If they are missing about half the order, then they should be able to refund you at least the delivery fees associated with the order."
882,I spoke to a representative named Jang and he said they can't do anything.
882,"So I paid a hefty convenience and delivery fee, yet still have to go out and do the things that I paid them to do"
1018,I placed an order from a convenience store that was supposed to take 15-30 minutes: an hour later and a dasher had not even arrived at store.
1018,Couldn't contact support through the app so had to do it online.
1018,"The agent said they could not do anything as it had not past the latest possible delivery time, which was only 5 minutes away."
1018,(And 30 minutes later than the previous delivery time) I then explained it has already been an hour and they said all they could do was reimburse me 20% which was $2.16.
1018,Waste of time and energy ordering on this app.
1018,I hate writing reviews but that's wild.
1018,"DD is a better app, quicker deliveries, easier to reach support, and seem to actually help resolve your order issues."
1336,I've reported this issue multiple times with no response besides your half-baked outsourced customer support that can barely understand the issue because of their English skills.
1336,Convenience stores do not load.
1336,"Any convenience store whether it's Walgreen's, 7-11, DashMart, doesn't matter."
1336,"The screen will freeze up, go white, load stuff in at a painfully slow rate, then crash."
1336,It's not my phone because everything works just fine even while the app is frozen.
1336,I've tried every piece of advice from both DoorDash and third parties online.
1336,"..After reading through recent reviews, I'm not the only one dealing with this."
1336,Figure it out bros.
409,Your refund process is ridiculous.
409,You subtract the partial refund from the original amount and then charge me again for that amount.
409,"Then you process the refund for the first charge which takes days to clear, so for a while I'm double charged instead of a basic partial refund."
1009,"Their fees are outrageous..Not only do they ALREADY up their prices on every item from businesses to profit from, but they also charge you all these ""fees""."
1009,"If I place an order and the order comes out to $11, the total with the FEES will come out to $20."
1009,How is that even fair?
1009,You're better off just driving to whatever food place yourself.
1009,"Not to mention, when you order through the app, the restaurant/place almost ALWAYS messes up your order somehow and you only get a partial refund depending on what happened and left with a messed up order still."
1009,".Their customer support team via phone has always been delightful which is why I'm giving two stars, but without them, it'd be a one star."
1009,".OH, and for some reason, when you order through the app, it won't show all the item the restaurants sell."
1009,I even called restaurants and asked why it's not on there and they have no idea..
345,"Such a useful app, extremely user friendly, no issues whatsoever, straightforward and easy to earn money and even set goal."
1237,I enjoy having the option of food being delivered to me.
1237,"Especially when I work at a place where I cannot leave the campus, such as the hospital."
1237,"Or when I live alone and sick, I can have someone deliver takeout, groceries, or even some medications for me."
1237,"However, I only wish that the option for tipping the dasher pops up once the delivery is made, similar to UberEats."
1237,How can I properly tip them prior?
1237,Is that supposed to be motivation for the dasher to earn money?
1237,"I don't tip much anymore because when I do, my dasher doesn't deliver well and becomes too complicated and doesn't work out well."
1237,So I would like the option to tip after delivery has been completed if that is something that could be changed.
1237,Thank you.
115,I was very pleased with my first Grubhub order.
115,I am now a fan and will be ordering often.
115,The fees were more than reasonable and the delivery went smoothly.
115,Grubhub has a chat feature to address any issues that customers might have.
115,"The agent, Mark, went out of his way to add on an á la carte item that I had forgotten to order."
115,Great service!
83,"I updated my contact information weeks ago but when the delivery person needed to call me, he had my old telephone number."
83,He gave me a hard time for not updating my contact number.
83,"I checked and my profile was accurate, including my new number."
83,I called the restaurant who advised that my old number came up with my order.
83,"After 20 minutes, on chat, the Grubhub/Seamless rep told me to update my profile (which I explained that I did so weeks ago)."
83,"She then, accusatorially, blamed me because I've had ""11 addresses"" on file."
83,"When I checked that, I saw that I have my home, work and 2nd job addresses in my profile."
83,None have the old profile info.
516,Making this a 5 star just so y'all will see it.
516,DO NOT use this app.
516,My order was picked up and dropped by FOUR people in a span of 30 minutes.
516,I then tried to contact customer support to see what was going on and the bot thought I wanted to cancel my order and charged me a $20 cancellation fee when I didn't even want to cancel.
516,"After spending an hour texting customer support (because they don't have a phone number), they tell me they processed a refund and to wait 3-5 business days."
516,That never came.
516,I contact them again two weeks later and they tell me there was nothing they could do because I need to contact them within 48 hours WHICH I DID.
516,They essentially told me to eff off and rudely ended the text conversation because there was nothing they could do since the previous person never actually processed my refund.
516,Deleted the app after that and will NEVER use again.. Glad i could donate to a multi-million dollar corporation
765,Last week I earned $20 for referring a friend..After trying to order today they asked for a password and after 2 trys they locked me out and said account not found even after entering my phone number.
765,All I could do was delete the app.
765,I tried several ways to locate my account.
765,.I've had no complaints with Uber until now.
765,"I'll use another food delivery service, just dissapointed that I don't get to use the $20 towards my next order."
765,UBER YOU NEED TO DO BETTER.
765,HOW CAN YOU SAY ACCOUNT NOT FOUND!!
765,Y'ALL HAVE TEXT ME OFTEN ABOUT AN ORDER BEING DELIVERED.
765,POOR CUSTOMER SERVICE
396,I keep making the same mistakes.
396,"I need a the ability to add notes for myself for restaurants or dishes, e.g."
396,"get the less sweet bubble tea, order extra ginger, extra spicy means regular spicy."
22,App Problem #1 was that the app showed wrong delivery address type (home/business).
22,The app makes it possible to edit the delivery address info.
22,So I did.
22,Bu the address type showing wrong type did not get fixed.
22,I tried again and then gave up.
22,..App Problem #2 was that every address edit was interpreted as a new order.
22,So got charged for 2 more orders.
22,..Restaurant Problem #1 was that they did not answer my call...Restaurant Problem #2 was that even though I texted them them that I have been trying to change my address they still sent me extra meals of the same exact order.
22,..Restaurant Problem #3 was that they ignored the fact that they received 3 exactly the same orders from the same person to the same delivery location within 2 minutes or so...Grubhub Support Problem #1 is that they are bot customer satisfaction oriented.
22,They don't have this predefined business instinct or making it right for the customer.
22,They made me explicitly ask for a refund and then repeat my request.
22,And then they wanted to refund only 1 extra order.
22,I had to really insist for them to finally cancel those orders and issue the refund.
22,Haven't received the refund yet.
22,Writing right after my interaction with the support.
181,"I've used grubhub for a while now, because it's honestly the only delivery app in my middle of nowhere town, but this is genuinely one of the most inconvenient and awful delivery apps I've had the misfortune of having to use."
181,"Problems are constant, food delivered to the wrong address more than it should be, and an interface that is very unresponsive and irritating."
181,Is it really that hard to send the same order to the same exact place more than once 💀
793,i ordered from a seafood restaurant that costs 50$.
793,the driver took my food and marked as delivered so i had never gotten my food that night.
793,customer service is just so awful they don't solve your issues or try to accommodate for your experience and they all say the same exact things.
793,after waiting 2WEEKS for a refund they then tell me i have to wait another 3-5 business days after calling my bank and everything.
793,worst experience ever and i will not be spending my money anymore with ubereats.
793,they play with peoples money and don't consider what it's like on the other side.
793,never again.
658,I decided that i wanted to order some donuts for the office.
658,Everything look good but as soon as i hit placed order it said it was to far.
658,I was bummed but said okay i'll just pick it up.
658,Well i chose pick up and ordered.
658,As soon as i placed the order it said unable to proceed and denied my card.
658,Bummed AGAIN i just decided to go to the donut shop in person.
658,Then i see my bank account to make sure i was not charged and guess what i WAS!
658,Called costumer service they said don't worry it's just pending but it's not going to go through.
658,"That was friday, I checked yesterday (tuesday) and it went through."
658,Called costumer service and they kept transferring me to different people.
658,No one was able to help me.
658,So now i have to call my bank and do a claim because they stole my money.
959,Pretty good and prompt.
959,Only thing is might take 3-5 business days to refund your $ to your bank account if a product is out of stock.
959,"Overall worth it so far and you can use standard Uber Cash from the regular Uber app for purchases which is nice, too!"
959,😊
1024,I don't understand how their rating is so high.
1024,I ALWAYS have an issue with Postmates.
1024,"I finally decided that even though my favorite vegan restaurant only delivers with Postmates, I have to stop trying to order delivery with them."
1024,Half the orders they end up canceling because of issues with drivers this has happened THREE separate times.
1024,"And the other half of the time the driver assigned seems to quit halfway through the order and then the whole process starts over again, making my food take 30-44 minutes longer."
1024,"It's ridiculous, I NEVER have these issues with DoorDash."
1024,I'm DONE with Postmates!
57,Where to begin… this company is truly terrible when it comes to customer service.
57,I've given them and their terrible customer service modal way too many tries.
57,"The latest fiasco, they blocked me from ordering using my credit card but were perfectly fine taking my money from the same credit card for Grubhub+."
57,All this after blocking my account bc I tried ordering food for my parents who were out of town.
57,"After contacting customer service 5 days in a row trying to regain my account, I got no answers, just empty promises that another team was ""working"" on it."
57,I'm frankly done with Grubhub.
57,I would rather pay more on other delivery apps than deal with this garbage system ever again.
101,I pay 20$ a month for free delivery.
101,I tried to order tonight and it says they cannot deliver to me.
101,I tried 3 different restaurants.
101,I called customer service and they told me they couldn't tell me why I can't order food.
101,"They said I would get an email in 3-4 days, which is obviously no help tonight."
101,"My credit card was charged for each of the deliveries they can't deliver, they said I have to also wait 5-7 days for that to be refunded."
101,I guess this service is okay if you have money to spend on food that will never come and that you have to wait a week to have refunded.
101,Not for me!
148,This is my first experience with Grubhub in Southern California.
148,"It's easy to place orders, the restaurant choices are many and the app is user friendly!"
148,I found that the fees are minimal unlike others recently so I will be using them more.
148,Plus the perks from certain credit cards and Grubhub rewards are very nice!👏
151,"When you have a major outage and you can't even get in touch with a human being, wait on hold for over 30 minutes, just to be hung up on, your credit card gets charged, and nothing is delivered."
151,Sounds exactly like a company that deserves a lawsuit.
151,GrubHub is a joke.
151,I will dispute every charge with my credit card company and delete the app.
151,I will also seek legal charges because you cannot simply take peoples money and not provide the service and then not provide support.
921,"Been waiting for months to a year for you guys to fix a ""quick"" problem that may not seem to be a big problem but sure proves yo be a nuisance (can't delete credit cards information off my account)."
921,Fix that and you'll get the fifth star.
921,Besides that everything else has been amazing.
1067,First time using and awaiting order updated for about 45 minutes and just 5 minutes before driver apparently reached my place the order was cancelled.
1067,"This app charges you money that they claim they will revert to credit card so basically they are playing with everyone's else money...I see this guys also edit the reviews to obtain higher rating, several 5 stars comments highlight how terrible is this app and its service"
1314,"I've been ordering DoorDash lately and then I had to delete my credit card because of how my siblings would be using it without my permission, and now that I put in one credit card I have ,DoorDash expects me to have another credit card I only have one and I had to go get food myself, this is frustrating."
1314,"I then had to ask my mom for her credit card for the second verification that it needed and it didn't work either, this is just very frustrating cause I don't have a car yet and have yo get myself one soon and now I'm having to get the food myself, I'm not complaint about getting the food myself I get to save more money like that but I don't like how DoorDash had to just expect their customers to have two credit cards"
1088,I ordered food for my sick 2 year old daughter and they took my money but didn't send out food and when I called them about it they said I didn't have an order on file.
1088,I talked to 5 different people and 3 of the 5 told me totally different things.
1088,"Now im stuck with no money and a sick, hungry baby."
1088,This app is by far the worst food delivery app EVER.
1088,Do not order from them.
1088,I could literally cry right now.
972,After multiple issues with this company I decided to part ways and take my business elsewhere.
972,I placed an order and the courier stole my food and put down they delivered it.
972,They have no customer support number to call you have to go to a chatroom and speak to a robot.
972,For a company as big as this there should be a support number for customers they can call for any issues and actually be able to speak to a human on the other end to help resolve issues.
636,I just waited for an order for over two hours.
636,The ETA changed for over 8 times and was pushed back for over 80 minutes.
636,"The only thing I was prompt on my order tracking page is ""we are sorry for the delay"" and the only option I was given was ""Got it""."
636,"When I go to the help page, the only offer was to cancel my order with no compensation or wait for the driver who did not move an inch for 50 minutes and did not reply for my message or call regarding updates and get 20% of my order in Uber cash."
636,This is extremely unprofessional of the driver and irresponsible of the platform.
636,No customer expects to wait well over the eta for food as of course I ordered with the expectation that I will be fed within a reasonable amount of time.
636,2 hours is not reasonable.
748,I've been using this app for years and I really appreciate the customer service.
748,"No matter what happens, my answers get responded quickly."
748,Only thing I would ask the team to improve on is to allow for food that disappoints you or was not prepared as such to be able to communicate with them about our expectations.
748,"Instead, we are told to contact them directly."
748,Uber should not be responsible but the restaurant should be.
748,Continue doing great I appreciate you all so much!
1127,The app is easy to use and has a way better format than the other delivery services I've used.
1127,"True to delivery time(except for when it's out of their control), delivery drivers have been great."
1127,If I was to have an issue with the quality of food it is very easy to get the issues resolved no headache!
1127,I'm just waiting on additional restaurants to be added lol I'm a foodie!..Only thing is there GPS is off.
1127,Idk if it's my address specifically but every time they have an issue finding my apt and spend 5 min trying to find my apt.
1127,When on my end it shows exactly where I'm at.
1127,And yes I've worked were I lived for 4 years the address is correct it shows on my end my exact building but it just never brings them here unfortunately.
1127,I always receive a call after them circling the property for 5 min trying to figure out where I'm at.
1127,Even had a delivery driver having issues trying to complete the order because the app said they were far away from the delivery address but they were speaking to me at the doorway… Other than this they are great!
1148,I've been using DoorDash for a couple years and I'm a very good and loyal customer.
1148,Their customer service used to be very good.
1148,Over the last few months it has gotten terrible.
1148,The orders are late and cold because your dasher is waiting at the restaurant for multiple orders and delivering more than one order at a time.
1148,The dasher was rude when I messaged him regarding my concern for the food quality for the late delivery.
1148,When you try to contact customer service it gets worse.
1148,My last experience was when I was disconnected by a rude agent via chat before my issue was resolved.
1148,Then my food showed up late and cold with one whole meal missing.
1148,When I recontacted the service they told me the only thing they could do for me was refund the missing meal.
1148,They wouldn't even do a reorder of the meal.
1148,They offered $5 as compensation which was insulting and they didn't even give it to me.
1148,"Then, when I asked to talk to a supervisor I was told it would take 2-24 hours because they were not available."
1148,"When I did get a call there was ""nothing they could do"" but report the issue."
1148,I'm extremely dissatisfied with DoorDash and I will never use them again.
1148,"Horrible Service, just awful."
1207,I ordered McDonald's from broadway 1 hour before they closed and they canceled my order 10 minutes after placing my order and taking my money i then called DoorDash and they told me I will receive a refund 3-5 business days I then went on to explain to the agent that was my last little bit of money I had to feed my family and that's the only thing I have to feed my family I have two children who are hungry right now I have no car which is why I'm using DoorDash the agent was no help I asked for a supervisor trying to explain my situation he then leaves me on hold for an hour tells me no supervisor is available and continue to give me the run around to speak to a manger I'm overly furious about this situation it didn't take 3-5 business days to take my money out my account it shouldn't take 3 days to go back into my account he then go on to try to offer me $10 in DoorDash credit like that's going to be enough for food
283,"If you buy something and it gets canceled, consider your money gone because the support team will not do their job of getting you your money back, I called them and they told me 4-5 buisness days, on the 6th I still received nothing."
283,"Then I called them again and they said it'll be 2 more days, im now on the 5th day and I still havnt received even a call."
283,Worst customer service.
614,Grubhub will refund when the order is wrong or cancelled.
614,Ubereats won't.
614,Not only will you not get your money back but they won't even have the order you paid for delivered to you.
614,Talked to support and got the same generic message back from multiple agents.
614,Said they'd have some special customer support team look into it and got a generic email with the same information in it but trying to shame me for asking for a fair refund…?
614,"""It looks like you've recently made several refund requests—many more than most other customers typically make."""
614,"Ok, ubereats."
614,This is the only time I've asked for a refund.
614,Gaslighting customers and keeping their money for a service that wasn't provided is a horrible way to run a business.
614,Can't imagine working for this company if this is how they treat customers.
614,Disgusting.
660,Discrimination to the highest level.
660,I had issues (several) with eats and switched to DD.
660,"And wanted to check if they have upgraded their services, but gone downhill."
660,"Just a day ago before writing this review, ordered through eats and the delivery person's car broke down right in-front of the restaurant."
660,Though the delivery person contacted the support they took staggering 30 mins to call me and update that my order will not be delivered.
660,When asked on the call to connect to a supervisor they apparently don't have a way to do so.
660,"Also, when I asked them to place another order on the call, they couldn't do that either."
660,"I wanted to raise issues, but for that I had to drop off the call from the support team and call them back; what a JOKE!!!!!"
660,!
197,I've been a GrubHub+ member for over 2 years.
197,This means that delivery fees are waived for orders over $12.
197,"Randomly, GrubHub has been charging me for delivery fees (which can get very expensive) even though I'm a + member and have orders over $12."
197,"I've attempted deleting the app, restarting it, calling the help line, and speaking with a help representative over chat."
197,"Still, this issue keeps happening."
197,"If GrubHub thinks they can steal from their loyal customers, everyone should abandon them and put them out of business."
372,Stay away from Grubhub.
372,The drivers are lazy and customer service is horrible.
372,I was a loyal customer until recently.
372,"Long story short, my food never arrived even though I contacted and talked to the delivery drive."
372,"I had to fight tooth and nail to receive a refund, spoke with two representatives until I got my money back."
635,I had searched and ordered from a restaurant but it turned out that the restaurant did not exist.
635,"Some other restaurant had two accounts, one with a fake name to attract customers."
635,"One customer care executive didn't reply back, another one told he cannot do anything as it's against their policy."
635,"I filing understand are they helping loyal customers or the restaurants who use fake names, trick customers...2."
635,Second incident: I had ordered and it took 1.5 hours.
635,I texted customer service but they asked me to wait for the order and said restaurant food won't get cold as it is insulated.
635,What nonsense.
635,This app has worst customer service.
635,Policies favouring restaurants and their app.
635,Customers are not taken care of.
635,"I have had so many issues, have made so many complains and no response."
728,Im a loyal customer that had been ordering lots of food and inevitably sometimes they miss a thing or two so i have to tell them to refund the item myself.
728,Well after not even having any price adjustments in months they refuse to refund anything off my order even when it's their own fault.
728,"Their systems are faulty and will not refund you if you've had more than a certain amount so you cant rely on them as a delivery service, this is outrageous considering how the whole point of having uber one is to be certain your food is here correctly and on time."
728,charging me for food that never even got delivered feels more like a scam than a proper service.
950,I love the service and how they take care of loyal customers.
950,95% of time when I have a issue with order or anything they make it right.
950,I definitely recommend!
950,Also recommended paying for membership because it does save money if you order often
1068,I'm not trying to start any beef or anything however Postmates has been the best experience for me let's talk about it🎯you guys are Awesome .
1068,You guys have loyal customers .
1068,You guys have a handy optional choices along with A perfect website ✨I appreciate you .
1214,This app is awful.
1214,They overcharge on their food and often get orders wrong and offer no recourse or refund.
1214,"If a $15 item isn't what you ordered, you'll receive $3.50 as a refund, if they even agree to that."
1214,"If you try to report an issue and the app crashes, they claim it is ""resolved"" and won't refund you."
1214,"If you call to report a problem with an order, you'll be put on a long hold and speak with someone who has little power to provide refunds and makes no effort to even understand what you're reporting."
1214,"If an order doesn't arrive, they'll claim a 24 hr team is looking into it, report the issue was resolved, and will not refund you."
1214,"Essentially, when they mess up, and they will, and often, they don't even try to do right by the customer...I was a loyal customer for over a year and finally got fed up."
1214,"DD is awful to customers, they're awful to drivers, and they're awful in general."
1330,I use doordash almost every other day and have been a loyal customer from quite sometime.
1330,"..But unfortunately, my recent experience has been abysmal."
1330,May be they don't care Saphire preferred subscribers as much as the normal dashpass subscribers as I see a change in their behavior since I moved to this new subscription.
1330,"..I ordered food the other day, the dasher arrived half an hour later than originally estimated doordash time and then he tried to hand over food which was clearly not mine."
1330,He informed me that the food vendor hasn't provided any receipt as well.
1330,I rejected the food saying that it's not the food I ordered and immediately contacted the support.
1330,That took a wild turn where I started getting bizzare replies like we will get back to you in 24 hours.
1330,They literally left me hungry and had to get food elsewhere.
1330,"..Later I got a strange email saying ""exceeded recent compensations""."
1330,I personally never asked me to compensate for anything before.
1330,The worst thing is there was absolutely no investigation as what happened to my order.
1330,"In any case, I didn't get my food and I lost my money."
1330,I'm gutted.
152,The service fee has skyrocketed from 9% of the subtotal to sometimes as high as 19% on my orders over the past few years.
152,"Between that and the menu prices already being inflated vs ordering from the restaurant directly, I decided to switch back over to DoorDash."
152,The same meals from the same restaurants are several dollars cheaper before the tip on DoorDash now vs GrubHub.
152,Disappointed because I had originally switched from DoorDash to GrubHub as GrubHub appeared to be cheaper at the time.
152,Not anymore.
1090,"the past few times I've ordered food they always arrive at the destination but then cancel the order and they take the food, and then when I try to message the delivery driver back they close out the message."
1090,"I order my food at work and I tell them what kind of vehicle I drive, but they either put it on the wrong vehicle or cancel the order, bad service, bad drivers."
470,Delivery apps like this will milk you for any extra penny you have.
470,"Great app to save time if you can't walk the extra 5 miles to go to these restaurants, horrible app for saving money; you might as well walk."
470,"Nobody is paying you to use this app, so why pay Grubhub to save money only to spend even more?"
995,This is not beneficial.
995,I want to save money with small orders yet the orders are still high.
995,"Even with Uber one, I have to spend over $20 to apply the promo and despite that my order is still high because the promo does nothing to reduce the price."
995,I applied for Uber one expecting the first month to be free (as they advertised) yet I was charged $5 on my card after applying.
995,"This is useless, I am an unsatisfied customer"
604,You'll get lucky if you get a good customer service rep when things go wrong.
604,My food is never satisfactory or delivered on time.
604,"I have had drivers tamper with my food, steal my food and deliver other orders before mine even though I paid for priority delivery and the app says my delivery is up next."
604,I have even tipped someone who had a horrible delivery and they told me they could not take the tip back because it had been past the 3 hour time frame but I reported straight after the delivery.
604,The fact that drivers can see if you tip or not ahead of time says it all.
604,Uber is ridiculous especially if you pay for a membership and receive mediocre customer service.
604,They literally will just hire anyone.
244,"Placed an order, but got an ""oops a problem occurred"" message, they still charged my account and held the money until I chatted with them for an hour."
244,They would do nothing to compensate my wasted time or missed window to order the food I wanted because my account was new.
244,"Buyer beware, I've had pleasant experiences with postmates, ubereats, and DoorDash, when there's an issue they've made it right, I'm never using grubhub again."
1,They blocked my account in sept I have followed the email steps and still have not yet received any response.
1,They will block you for any little thing especially when some things are out of your control.
1,For example I will have two deliveries my first delivery pick up would be my last drop off.
1,The time stamp would be to drop my second delivery off first at 3:38 but my first delivery time stamp would be 3:36 how is that even possible ?
1,I had NUMEROUS deliveries like this one.
1,"They will constantly send me alerts about delivering orders late, but how when this is what the apps/system suggests me to do."
1,I'm only following what's giving to me.
1,Also you would get a delivery request but the restaurant would just be getting it when you arrive and you'll have to wait for the order to be done.
1,"I put in the app ""order not started until I arrived "" you would think they will adjust your time stamp to deliver."
1,You can't put a time on how fast food is prepared.
1,A lot of things needs to be updated so future drivers like myself won't have such a headache when trying to make a living.
1,I started this in July and I'm already blocked in September and as of currently still no response or update regarding my account.
1,You guys should get customer service employee's to help with blocked accounts instead of having drivers waiting and responding to emails that never receive a reply!
1038,"I will no longer be using Postmates, and I highly recommend that others do the same."
1038,"The past month, I have had a problem with nearly every single order I have received, whether it be arriving an hour late, receiving less than half of my order, or the order being completely cold by the time it arrives."
1038,"This is a continuous issue, and is clearly a waste of both your time and your money (and that's not even going into the ridiculous upcharges and ""service fees"" that add up to ten dollars on your order)."
873,I told the agent the problem.
873,Did nothing to help.
873,Then instead of finding a solution.
873,The agent closed the chat out.
873,The app was glitching and I couldn't see the tracking.
873,No one accepted the delivery that I could see from my end.
873,I definitely would use a different ordering app because how the agent handled it was unprofessional and rude.
873,It should not take over an hour for a drink that is 12 minutes away.
873,I am very frustrated and would not recommend it to anyone due to how the agent handled it.
873,I am paying money for a service to deliver food.
62,"I used DoorDash for a couple years and just canceled because I was bored of the same restaurants, their drivers suddenly started delivering my food to the wrong house, and I had to reorder and hope they got it right..I switched to Grubhub and at first I loved it."
62,The problem is if you order something far it comes faster than if you want something from a spot close by.
62,I ordered from a McDonalds thats 5 min away and its been over an hour.
62,The driver picked my food up but has been doing other deliveries.
62,Now my food will be cold and at this point Id rather have loaded my newborn up in the car to just drive down there so I can have a warm meal.
842,"For at least one of every three delivery orders, Uber's navigation sends the drivers to a wrong location."
842,The address shows up correctly but my deliveries are always sent to a location a few blocks away and it's obnoxious.
842,Tried to contact customer service on this but they've done nothing to correct it over the last couple years.
842,So I have to call drivers and explain the issues which most times works out but sometimes are a disaster.
196,Waited over an hour for our food.
196,"I contacted them to make sure things were okay, they informed me their drivers were busy but they were prioritizing my order."
196,About a minute later the order was cancelled.
196,They offered me a $5 credit and to be refunded in 3-5 days.
196,After an hour and a half.
196,If there's no drivers available they should tell you that not wait an hour and a half.
196,Never had these issues with DoorDash 🤷🏼‍♀️
241,Though it's an occasionally necessary service.
241,Inconsistencies abound in ordering.
241,The drivers consistently fail to do simple things like count the items and or make sure utensils or sauces are present.
241,And when a mistake is made which is frequently there's no way to address the issue with the restaurant and or fix on the spot.
546,"I don't usually order with them, but we have very limited delivery options in our area and try various options (DoorDash, grubhub, etc.)."
546,We had to have a reorder because it wasn't telling the drivers our house number so the first driver just left our order at a random house even though the box of food they were delivering had the full address with house number on it.
546,"On the redelivery, same issue happened but the delivery driver very rudely told me that I need to make sure I put my house address in so he's not wasting his gas trying to find the house since they barely pay enough to cover the gas."
546,When I explained that I had indeed put the house number in and he should talk to the company since clearly there's an issue on their end not giving the drivers the house number.
546,He told me I sound confused and must have put it in the wrong place and I should be grateful he even decided to deliver it to us as most people don't deliver to our area.
546,I think we'll be deleting this app and sticking with the other companies from now on.
595,My order was received with my coffee not even half full as it had spilled all over the sandwich I had ordered.
595,"I used the help function, took a picture through the app and sent my request."
595,When you take a picture through the app it doesn't save to your phone.
595,Support claims there was no picture attached and bc the app doesn't save the photo to your phone I had nothing to send later when they asked for it again.
595,Bc of this they credited me $10 on a $21 order that was entirely ruined.
595,"I asked for the request to be escalated and they said I ""had reached the highest level of support"" and refused to engage w me further."
595,"If you decide to continue to order from this grifter of a billion dollar business, make sure you save the photo of your damaged items to your phone bc they'll do anything to avoid doing what's right for the consumer."
651,Here's my problem.
651,I assumed this app tracked your location like the ride app does.
651,So I placed an order.
651,A few minutes goes by and I really start looking it's getting delivered to Seattle(which was the last place I used the app) I'm in Orlando Florida.
651,So cancel the order and I'm charged a 20 dollar convenience fee.
651,Check your restaurant location and make sure it's in the same state.
651,"Lol  didn't check it, but I shouldn't have placed the order."
651,"Still my fault but hey Uber work on that for me, I already started a fund to help in research"
992,Pay for priority deliver that says 25-35 minutes and took an hour and a half.
992,Refund?
992,Nope!
992,..There should be a test for every Uber driver to make sure they know how to drive in the city.
992,"These people, and I don't mean the drivers only, app makers as well, don't know how to navigate the city."
992,I'll watch my delivery and they will take side streets instead of the freeway.
992,A 15 minute drive will take them 35 minutes cause the drivers follow the stupid navigation app given to them instead of driving the fastest route.
992,Garbage
1042,"this happened 2 years ago and i'm still reeling from how unprofessional, greedy, and inefficient this company is."
1042,".not only had I ordered an item from them and not received it, but they charged me TWICE for the unreceived item."
1042,"i contacted customer experience immediately, and it wasn't resolved for FOUR MONTHS."
1042,i didn't need the money so much as i wanted to make sure postmates didn't have it.
1042,"i haven't used a food delivery app since, and especially caution my friends and family against postmates specifically."
1289,"My brother paid $30 for our lunch and accidentally tipped $10, but was fine with it because he wanted the person to have a nice tip."
1289,We waited over an hour for him to get a notification that the food was here.
1289,It's not.
1289,The food is nowhere in sight and the picture the driver took is of a house down the street.
1289,"The picture doesn't even show the food, it's just a photo of the neighbors house taken from the driver's car."
1289,He asked the neighbor and no one dropped any food off there.
1289,"When he tried to reach out to customer service, the agent ended the chat out of nowhere while he was trying to type his response."
1289,"..I've driven for DoorDash before and if I got a $10 tip, I would do everything in my power to make sure that customer received good service."
17,I have had multiple times where a restaurant and/dasher calls because the order does not exist in their system or someone has given the wrong CC information.
17,Grubhub jacks up the prices then processes your card meanwhile someone calls the restaurant and uses a company CC.
17,I had a restaurant call me one time and said they wouldn't let my food go because my CC was declined…they then told me how it Grubhub calls them and pays with a different card.
17,I gave the restaurant another CC and my food was delivered.
17,"Meanwhile, Grubhub said my card was already processed and couldn't cancel the charge or do anything…until I told them what that the restaurant already told me that Grubhub personal gave them their CC that was declined then all of a sudden I had an instant refund."
17,The same thing just happened again but worse.
17,This company is nothing but robbing you.
17,"And what about the ""free memberships"" with other apps?"
17,Are they really free if I'm charged hella dollars for a service fee every order AND jacked up prices.
17,"No it's not free, just a scam!"
157,"For the past three days I've tried to update my profile - change the present address, etc."
157,I get a message saying something has gone wrong and try again later.
157,Ridiculous!
157,I'm trying to order food and I'm supposed to wait?
157,I have free delivery through Walmart+ and I've had to use other apps!
157,I'm going to delete this if it isn't corrected.
157,Sorry it isn't through Walmart but I don't remember where I got it.
300,"Grubhub is cheaper than other apps and has restaurants I love, but I hate that you don't get a text with a picture of where ur food is located like the other apps."
300,I literally have to walk the entire lobby looking for my food (it's never dropped off at my door like asked).
300,"The driver tracking is also not ""real time"" and exact as other apps."
706,I almost never write comments or reviews.
706,This one has been overdue for sometime now.
706,"I have lost track of how many times did I NOT receive the correct order, sometimes items ordered were missing, and other times the order itself was missing."
706,"I know it's not Uber who prepares the food, however, they sure deliver it and that's the company I pay."
706,It would be extremely nice for a driver to verify the food items (may be not open the boxes) before they pick it up.
706,I am very dissatisfied with Uber yet I order from them cause I have found very many options on other apps.
706,I would love to be an Uber member if they can improve this for me.
1043,It's my birthday today and I have wanted a specific thing on the Starbucks menu but other delivery apps do not have the full menu like you guys do so I am very happy about that.
1043,Thank you for having more options than other apps.
1078,"Postmates definitely has cheaper prices when it comes to other apps such as UberEats or DoorDash, but the quality of the service is horrendous."
1078,"If you don't pay your drivers a big enough tip, they'll take FOREVER to deliver your food!"
1078,I can't tell you the amount of times I just cancelled my order because it was infuriating waiting for food that would seemingly never come…
1225,I had to switch from this food delivery app.
1225,The prices have gotten worse and worse since I started using this app years ago.
1225,"Not only do they charge an absurd handling fee on top of the delivery fee, but they increase the price of everything on restaurants menus."
1225,The normal price of a burger from your favorite restaurant becomes even more expensive when using the app.
1225,"The restaurant receipt was stapled to my last order and it came to a total of 54$, the DoorDash cost for the food alone was nearly 75$ before they added the handling fee, delivery fee, taxes and tip."
1225,The 54$ meal it would have cost to pick up became nearly 100$ meal.
1225,"I always thought it was the restaurants who were upping their prices during Covid, but it turns out it was just DoorDash marking everything up."
1225,"I get you pay for convenience, but they sure hide a lot of their markup."
1225,Other apps provide lower fees and actual restaurant prices.
1227,I love doordash they're very important to me and family of 11 and when I'm at work or busy I can't cook or I forget to pick something up from being so tired.
1227,"Yes it's been a few problems with my orders, things missing or my order has been canceled or damaged, however doordash fixes all of my issues with respect and unfortunately sometimes a refund, more than a few times my order has been canceled do to my driver having an emergency with his/her car."
1227,So sometimes I just get refunded and pickup the order up myself.
1227,I'm a customer and contractor with this app.
1227,My suggestion is that Doordash drops lying customers and lying contractors and assist with banning them like other apps do
1268,"Let me start with the good: Convenient, reliable (mostly), and fair in comparison to other apps The not so good: Dashers often are late, there's little accountability other than a refund (more on this) if something is missing or wrong, store menus are not always updated or right."
1268,The UGLY: Reviews are kicked back unless they are 4-5🌟.
1268,"Huge issue with that, it's fraud!"
1268,"If there's a review for a place submitted with less than 3 stars, it's kicked back and not submitted, even if it's not going against the posted guidelines for a review."
1268,This means establishments are not held accountable except for a refund through the application and more people will endure the same poor results.
1268,I'm available for verification if needed.
715,"When you have issues with an order they connect you with a bot, not a live person, and it's impossible to find a way to contact a live person."
715,I've run into issues countless times where it charges me for an order and won't connect to a driver so I sit there waiting for hours until it cancels on their end.
715,"I tried canceling on my end this time because I didn't want to waste my time and the app prompted me to cancel and didn't refund me at all- I finally got a hold of a live person and they told me it was ""in the terms"" that no refunds are given- so now I'm without food and money?!"
715,What a load of crap- this app is terrible and I will never be using it again.
745,I have had several safety concerns with ubereats drivers.
745,"I have reached out to ubereats countless times and the only ""advice/resolution"" they offered was for me to contact the driver directly with my concerns which seems like unsafe protocol/suggestions for customers who have the specific issue with the drivers behavior."
745,"BUT after digging a little further into safety concerns, just saw how an Uber driver broke into a passengers house after he dropped her off and Uber didn't fire him until AFTER it went viral on TikTok."
745,That's disgusting!
745,I use to love Uber but it has seriously gone down hill since the pandemic.
745,I will be using other delivery services and using Lyft.
185,When ordering pizza there is no way to customize .Each half of the pizza for ordering different extras.Separately on each half of the pizza.
185,I put special instructions for this which were not paid any attention.
185,This would be great functionality to add.To simplify orders and to maintain customer satisfaction!
504,"This app worked fine for a while, then it started to involve some operations that failed the customer satisfaction for sure."
504,I just ordered a dinner a couple of days ago and everything was just fine until minutes after the order was placed and almost ready to deliver.
504,"So it happened that I opened the app to check order status and my order was canceled, and the stated argument was that I called the restaurant to cancel the order over phone."
504,Besides that Uber customer service told me when chatting that they were sorry and my $ can't be refunded because I have canceled too many orders recently which was totally false and not demonstrated.
504,"Then #1 how is it possible that Uber may allow a customer to cancel and order over phone that he placed online through the app instead of canceling using the app, and #2 how is that you can tell me I won't receive full refund for a non-demonstrated action."
504,Guys you need to improve your operations or if this continues happening you will totally lost many clients.
504,I uninstalled the app and hope to find some other new app or an entrepreneur who can do a little better with less complications because this is a difficult time to waste $ for no good reason.
504,I better call straight to the restaurant and make my order than handle my $ to such an irresponsible entity.
199,Ordered food for myself and kids.
199,Waited an hour and then they email me to tell me my order was cancelled and that I would see my money back in 5 business days.
199,They had double booked it.
199,"Wrong driver grabbed my food and they just say hey too bad so sad, we will give you your money back later."
199,Right way would have been to attempt to expedite a new delivery but now I have to use another service and wait another hour.
199,Terrible customer service
227,Often the app tells me my food is delivered but it's not!
227,There's no accountability!
227,They will sometimes refund your money (3-5 business days) and sometimes not!
227,The people in customer service (like Emily H) just stop the chat whenever you tell them that just getting a refund in 3-5 business days and no food is not satisfactory just hang up and get off the chat.
227,For the high cost I would imagine better customer service!
458,"First time using the app, place an order of more than 75 dollars for my family lunch, 20 min before the order arrived I received an email saying ""order cancel"" your redound to your card within 5 business days"" this is beyond unacceptable, they kept my money for 5 days and left me without lunch!"
948,Wait was way longer then listed on app.
948,The first person was on a bike who was 6 miles away to pick my food up.
948,"I told her this was making me late, so she canceled."
948,The next person was on a bike and road pass the restaurant and my house to go Several mile away.
948,At this point I had to leave and now I have to wait 3 to 7 business days for my order.
948,.
948,If they are on a bike they should not take the order if they are far away.
948,I don't want anyone bringing my food when they're on a bike for numerous reasons!
948,!
1034,"This is about the 10th time I've had a delivery driver steal my food and mark it as delivered, but I've had enough."
1034,I've ended my membership.
1034,"I ordered an entire meal and this driver named MIYRA in Los Gatos marked it as picked up, waited 10 minutes, then marked delivered."
1034,"When I called support, they said it had been delivered to an address - which was the restaurants."
1034,These drivers are scamming the company and customers and the best they can do is offer a refund in 3-5 business days.
1034,"I'm so over this, Postmates."
1034,Punish your drivers and make them photograph evidence of delivery for once in their lives.
1258,I usually always go to the store buy and pick up my own food.
1258,Recently i've been using this app.
1258,"All the food is taxed on top of the actual price through this app, On top of that you want me to wait an hour for the delivery, and still want me to give the driver a tip."
1258,Not happening.
1258,My food could usually cost 10$ and i'll be paying 20$ just for the food before the delivery prices and taxes come in.
1258,It can say it's an 8 minute pick up but 50 minute delivery when the store is down the street..
1258,I'm sorry but this app is really unacceptable looking at it from someone who usually does it themselves.
1258,It's a scam and you guys are getting a lot of money out of this and still want me to pay a tip to the dasher.
1258,I'm sorry but you guys can pay the tip if my order is 10$ more then what it usually will be.
1258,"(not including delivery, taxes, or tip)"
673,So I had an issue where I didn't receive some food items.
673,I one of the food items that I did receive had a hair in it.
673,The customer service  made it seem like the main issue was the hair in the food.
673,Which was an issue but we wanted a refund for what we didn't receive.
673,Which was literally half the order.
673,"The customer service was very automated, scripted and not helpful at all."
673,"Which convenient as according to the terms, nothing could be done as they disregarded we were still missing half our order and only made it about a hair."
673,By the way they wanted a photo by the time they got back to us was four days.
673,This seems like a greedy corporation with bad customers service.
53,Zero stars.
53,I just finally deleted my account after multiple terrible experiences with botched deliveries and uncaring customer service agents.
53,"This last time was similar to the previous - I literally waited for an hour and a half, got a message that my delivery was complete (nope, no food here!!)"
53,"and the only response was ""would you like a redelivery in an estimated 50 minutes?"""
53,"No, I absolutely would not like to wait almost another hour for your incompetent delivery service."
53,"Also, the word ""redelivery"" implies there first was an original delivery, which was not the case."
53,The chat agent never offered a sincere apology or any kind of redeeming gesture.
53,Then I got an email for a $10 credit for THE NEXT time I make an order.
53,"Lol, $10!"
53,Nope.
53,Done with GrubHub.
235,Account has been compromised multiple times with zero context on what happened or how to gain access back to my account from the GrubHub team.
235,Overall terrible experience and now have to change cards and go through a number of other related efforts.
235,Cannot even gain access back to my account because the team has not reset correct email in account.
235,Avoid putting your info and data here.
500,"Terrible experience, especially when using the app."
500,"Deliveries canceled on me by Grubhub, incorrect information about driver availability, glitchy functionality."
500,Restaurant owners and consumers inconvenienced all around!
500,With so many competitors who blow Grubhub out of the water I plan on never using GH again.
890,I ordered at the wrong location and immediately canceled the order.
890,"However, after the cancellation my refund was denied."
890,So I went to the Uber help staff only to be left be waiting for 10 minutes before getting a response.
890,I asked if I could still receive the order still since it charged but they denied that and gave me a generic AI generated response when it was supposedly suppose to be a actual person.
890,Terrible experience from this money hungry company would not recommend getting this app.
1249,I have no idea how many times my order has been canceled after I've waited and waited.
1249,Finally writing A review on this app after my terrible experience about 10 minutes ago.
1249,I ordered a Wendy's meal at 4:22 PM.
1249,At first estimated delivery was 4:40 PM then it constantly got pushed back until delivery time was 5:20 PM.
1249,Mind you this Wendy's is a five minute drive from my house.
1249,I can't drive due to medical reasons so I was really relying on DoorDash for my daughters birthday dinner that's what she wanted.
1249,"however, at 5:20 PM I got the notification that my order was canceled because Wendy's computers never got it."
1249,I called Wendy's and they had prepared the order and the Dasher just never showed up.
1249,I asked for a refund on the DoorDash app and it has been five days and no show of me getting my money back.
1249,absolutely disgusted.
1310,"If you have any desire to have a possibility of good customer support, don't use this."
1310,Do yourself a favor and get your food in any other possible way.
1310,"Grubhub, ubereats, hiring a dog with a backpack and a working knowledge of currency."
1310,"Anything is better than this...They screwed up my order, twice for the same order, trying to get any customer service was a nightmare."
1310,The chat option sucked and agents just trying to placate me instead of just doing what I asked: issuing a full refund.
1310,"They keep sending me emails saying they're trying to call me, when I haven't gotten any calls from anyone from doordash."
1310,"In the emails they say I can respond to that within 72 hours, when I do I get no response."
1310,Just a terrible experience all around.
1276,At least half of the dashers will be people too incompetent to get hired at any job.
1276,You'll buy an $8 meal but after Doordash fees and tip it'll be $22.
1276,"Oh, but you can spend $12 a month to get rid of scummy fees, but only if what you order is over $10 in food 🤷🏼‍♀️ you're better off spending that money on gas and going to get your food yourself."
1276,".I ordered a burger for me and nuggets with fries for my girlfriend, we received only the fries."
1276,Doordash at least let's you refund if there's a problem… only one item though 🤷🏼‍♀️ ..Go get your food yourself.
1276,Do not overpay to have some disgusting unsanitary random stranger to handle your food.
1276,I have had instances where the seal was broken and we suddenly have 6 fries total.
1276,Doordash will let LITERALLY anyone deliver.
1276,It's easier to become a driver than it is to buy a gun in Texas.
378,My order has been over an hour late or has been dropped an hour after purchase the last three times I've purchased.
378,"You cannot get ahold of them on the phone due to ""usually high call volume"" and the people you talk to through the app refuse to refund you."
378,Use any other food delivery app
980,Special-needs people that use this app to feed themselves.
980,They give refunds but it's never enough to cover a 2st order.
980,It's like them stealing little by little .
980,An it takes 48 hours for them to refund!
980,Today my client doesn't have enough to make other order.
980,"When trying to get ahold of someone to talk to , but they don't have a hotline to talk to someone ."
980,All  my clients want is their food they order .
980,taking a vantage of people that can barely take care of themselves is not cool.
1058,"same old complaints: exorbitant delivery fees, inability to make customizations or add sauces etc, impossible to get orders fixed right then when there are errors, you can only get a refund or order the whole thing again."
1058,too impersonal and hard to get ahold of anyone that does take accountability.
1058,"BUT, i keep coming back for the convenience and at least they tend to be quick with refunds."
1058,¯\_(ツ)_/¯
1115,"Service is complete trash, worse daily."
1115,I have to get refunded majority of my orders and just go without or get in my car and go pick up after wasting time with completely false delivery windows or drivers who completely ignore addresses.
1115,"No convenience with any of it, so the app and service are worthless."
1255,The worst customer service ever!!!
1255,Ordered dinner that worth $100  and waited an hour but nothing was delivered even though the driver put my order was delivered.
1255,When I reported the problem i was told that my report has been noted and someone was going to contact me but nobody did.
1255,I contacted the customer support and they said at first i was supposed to contact them right away when i told them what happened they said wat for an email and of course nothing so I contacted back and they told me that they can't do anything about my last order and i was not going to get any kind of refund.
1255,I've been using the app for a few years never had any problem before this so very DISAPPOINTED not sure if i can order something else again knowing I'm not going to get any help if something like this happen again.
736,Please use GrubHub or DoorDash do not use UberEats this company is ran by a bunch of convicts who wanted to steal money from innocent people this company is a disaster and everything about them is horrible they will say one price and then as soon as they get your card information try to milk you for every single dollar you've got they do not want to deliver your food they do not want to see you eat this company wants to just take your money and watch you starve on the side of the road everything that they sell and everything that they have is overpriced this company is absolutely horrible and needs to be shut down immediately because they're all convicts and just scam artists
784,"When UberEats application or your connection have an issue and UberEats server is unable to connect back to your phone, UberEats will ASK YOU TO RETRY YOUR ORDER WITHOUT YOU KNOWING UBEREATS ALREADY PROCESSED THE FIRST TRANSACTION."
784,"If you call them, they will say, the store has already processed your order and UberEats will be charged blah blah blah… GET THIS."
784,"If it weren't for the application prompted me to retry the order, there wouldn't be any duplicate at all."
784,IT'S A SIMPLE LOGIC 🤯🤯🤯..Like how do Banks able to automatically dispute or disapprove a duplicate charge within seconds of time and UberEats cannot?!?!?!
784,"FRUSTRATING...For whoever's fault, if you cancel, UBEREATS WILL NOT RETURN THE ENTIRE AMOUNT."
784,You'll be surprised to see a tab equivalent to two Entrees in a restaurant.
575,I ordered food to be delivered to my girlfriend who is in a pinch and doesn't have money for lunch.
575,"Not only did the driver not follow the instructions, but after calling and having me reiterate them to him, he never delivered food to my girlfriend."
575,"..After that I attempted another order but my girlfriend had to go back to work so she couldn't eat even if she wanted to, and we were charged a second time for cancelling."
575,When trying to get a refund they couldn't even immediately refund my card.
575,"Instead they offer ""Uber cash"" which traps you into spending more with them, and they refused to refund the 2nd order that was unable to be completed as well...Completely dissatisfied and now I'm out 50-60 dollars."
575,I don't care about the Uber cash remaining in my account.
575,I'm never using this service again.
575,Don't recommend.
623,Not only is the app buggy and annoying to use(randomly closing while I'm making an order or bugging out when I'm trying to contact my driver).
623,"The ""support"" is non existent."
623,My orders have been messed up multiple times but when you contact support you could be waiting up to 3-4 DAYS for a response.
623,Then when you get the response they ask for information that you would've had 3 DAYS ago (which was not asked for at the time of the original claim) but now you don't so they throw you 5 dollars in Uber cash and say F off for a 45 dollar order that was ruined or wrong.
623,I was an Uber one member as well which you think would make things better.
623,Will never use the app again same with Uber.
623,It's a scam and they don't care what happens to your money or food as long as they get paid.
778,Part of my order was missing.
778,"It came with dry fried chicken, no sauce, rice, soup, or seasonings, ruining the entire meal."
778,"The entree was $20 and they ""refunded"" me $5 uber cash."
778,"I don't want uber cash, I want my money back!"
778,I had to wait an hour for my food just for it to be incomplete and inedible.
778,"Terrible service and there's no way to contact customer service through the app about the problem, they just keep saying ""we already refunded you $5 uber cash for this order""."
778,To even USE the $5 I'd have to spend more of my own money!
778,Literally try any other food delivery app because they will at least pretend to care about their customers experience.
866,Don't like how this would be my 2nd time Uber has been charging from what I haven't spent.
866,They charged me 21 dollars worth of food and I didn't even order anything… I didn't get a refund.
866,I checked my email to see if I accidentally charged myself but no receipt.
866,And I have checked my past orders but there's nothing with a charge of 21 dollars within that day it was taken from my account.
866,I called they did help me out but they told me to send them a screenshot of my charger and since then I haven't heard anything from them.
866,No emails no refunds not even Uber cash.
943,My order is constantlyyy wrong when I order from UberEats.
943,"On top of that, the system for ""correcting"" the problem is horrible."
943,"Constantly disappointed, paying more money than the food is worth when I'm missing half my order, and when they've refunded me in Uber Cash I always got less Uber Cash in my account than was supposed to be refunded."
943,"And if you call customer service, they'll tell you there's nothing they can do."
943,Frustrated and hungry.
943,Will never use UberEats again.
114,Orders are constantly late.
114,Sends drivers to wrong address.
114,Whenever I order I get one ETA then when that time passes I receive an updated eta for 30+ minutes into the future.
114,I app will say driver has your order but the location can't be tracked and it still shows as being at the restaurant.
114,Once I upgraded to free delivery the actual prices went up and delivery times are consistently 50 minutes.
114,After numerous mishaps and random order cancelations after an hour of waiting for an order I will never use this service again.
207,Grubhub systematically takes advantages of workers and customers.
207,..They refuse to provide their drivers with support and accurate navigation.
207,I live in a condo complex and my food is delivered to the wrong address every other time.
207,No matter what instructions I provide.
207,..Grubhub will refund your order for this once.
207,But if it happens twice they will just take your money.
207,"Your account will be labelled as a scammer, no matter how much evidence you provide."
207,..Grubhub is not a food delivery service.
207,"They make their money via fees and scams like this, claiming they provided a service when they didn't."
207,"..The fees are double what the food costs, plus tips, because they don't pay their drivers."
207,..There is no possible way for you use this app without being scammed.
338,If I could rate negative stars I would.
338,I used this app for a while and in the last 3ish months it has been nothing but issues.
338,Cold food.
338,Incorrect food.
338,Food delivered to the wrong address.
338,Don't expect to get help from customer service.
338,They are beyond awful.
338,Unprofessional.
338,You will not get reimbursed.
338,They will offer you credits toward future orders.
338,It's the worst company I have ever dealt with.
589,We ordered some cake but my husband soon realized we had the wrong address in and cancelled it within a minute so there was no way they were preparing our order.
589,We proceeded to place the correct order to which the driver cancelled on us.
589,The 19 dollars was refunded however the first order of 30 they refuse and then this morning I woke to find they had taken another random 18 dollars out of my account.
589,This is the second time they keep charging us randomly.
589,The first time I was resolved and they were the kind the second time the help line basically said you should have contacted us that night sorry there is nothing else we can do and would not further explain why we were charged three different times for food we did not get.
589,This is the second time they have done this to us.
589,Watch your account because they seem to make random charges.
720,I will no longer be using this app after my latest experience.
720,"Ordered delivery around 5pm, food was probably ready around 5:30, but the driver kept getting lost, and once they finally picked the food up they delivered it to the wrong address!"
720,"I demanded a full refund through the app which thankfully I got, but c'mon, you mean to tell me your drivers can't even get the address right?"
720,"I could've easily gone out and got it myself, which is exactly what I'll be doing from now on instead of using this money-grabbing scam of an app ever again."
720,"Believe me, you don't wanna waste your time and money with this app."
720,You're much better off ordering delivery through the restaurant itself.
1085,If you hate having your deliveries given to the wrong address.
1085,This company is the most efficient and I would say has the fewest mistakes or missed dinners.
1132,"Some time after coming out DoorDash added the feature for dashers to ""complete other orders nearby""."
1132,"Then after creating this problem where the customers food gets cold, DoorDash ""solved the problem"" by allowing the customer to pay extra for direct delivery."
1132,It's ridiculous to ask the customer to pay extra to solve the problem you created.
1132,Numerous times I've gotten cold food regardless of how good the driver is.
1132,"Sometimes the nearby customer won't come to their door, or the ""nearby order"" isn't nearby at all."
1132,"If it wasn't for the fact that I enjoy hot food, this wouldn't be a problem, I can wait a little longer for my food, but it gets cold."
1132,"Without this feature I would give DoorDash five stars as a customer, until then it's two."
1132,I assume the multiple orders feature was only added to appease the dashers who weren't being payed properly.
1132,"But maybe instead of putting that onto the customer you just pay your dashers fairly...Side note, I would also love if they could add a feature to see the car your dasher is driving, a color and make or something."
1132,"I live in a city where the dashers have a hard time finding me, and I'd love to be able to pick out their car and wave them over."
301,Please update the gos you give the drivers.
301,I had to direct two drivers to my building after they were given incorrect directions through the app.
301,The food and service was wonderful!
1267,"I use DoorDash and lot, and I have used it for almost 3 years."
1267,We have rarely had issues that were not the restaurant's fault.
1267,"However, in the last few months, the map function that the app uses has been sending the dashers to the completely wrong street."
1267,For years this was not an issue.
1267,"All of a sudden, every time we order the dasher ends up calling us to say they can't find our house, and it it can sometimes be a huge hassle to get the dasher to the house."
1267,"Doordash, please update your maps."
1267,"This house has been here since 1976, so it's definitely you and not me."
7,"I ordered Wendy's one night at around 10:00 - 10:15, and they had to delay my order for about 30 minutes, which i get, stuff happens ya know it can't always be perfect."
7,"And then I get another delay, and then another, next thing I know my order is not going to arrive until an hour and a half past when it was originally going to arrive."
7,"I noticed that when I went to the Home Screen where all the restaurants are, they had all closed."
7,"When I searched places such as insomnia cookie, which stays open very late, it said they were still open but it wasn't appearing on the Home Screen."
7,This meant there were no delivery drivers to actually deliver my order now and Grubhub does not know how to handle this when it happens.
7,I contacted support and was told my order could not be cancelled but could instead receive a 10% discount .
7,.
7,Woo.
7,"I attempted to contact support multiple times after but for some reason it would not reconnect me to anyone else, I did get reconnected to one person, however they said nothing the entire time, and after sitting in the call for about 5 minutes with no response, I left."
7,"This is definitely up there with some of the worst experiences I've had with delivery services, I was honestly kinda impressed."
41,Placed an order for delivery an hr ahead of time from a fast food restaurant.
41,Driver shows as being at the restaurant then drives to a different location.
41,I message them and then they cancel the delivery 5 min after I had scheduled the delivery.
41,"I contact customer service they say it will be another hr, and give me a 10$ perk."
41,I cancel the order and place a new one.
41,The new driver delivers the old order that had been sitting for 2 hrs and keeps the fresh order.
41,I contacted the restaurant to find out if there were two orders so I know there was no reason for the food to be cold.
41,The order I received had the initial time of the first order I placed.
41,I contact support again for a full refund cause everything is freezing cold.
41,Instead they give me $5 off my next purchase.
41,Deleting my account and the app.
308,Please please please hire better people or educate the one you have on how to treat customers.
308,Oh and you should make the options that we pick on the app such as (Hand the order to me) but instead the driver just leave it wherever then leave.
308,I try to contact support but they always have a way to shut me down even tho I'm a plus member!!
308,If that matters lol....I'm done with food delivery
801,Ordered something from a pharmacy.
801,They didn't have it in stock.
801,App wouldn't let me update the replacement item the delivery driver found.
801,So I place a second order with the new item.
801,"App then doesn't cancel the first order, and sends the driver back and allows them to replace the item."
801,Go to cancel the 2nd order.
801,App won't let me cancel the second order.
801,"Contact support, they take 25 minutes to not cancel the second order and it gets delivered too."
801,Paid for 2 orders of something I only need 1 of for a year.
801,Have 2 of something I need 1 of and got charged delivery feeds and tipping for 2 deliveries.
924,I did my first ever order today and the food was delivered to a Whole Foods instead of my apartment.
924,The driver called and requested my pin.
924,"Without knowing that would allow her to claim the food was delivered, it was provided."
924,..I received a notification the food was delivered yet I never saw it.
924,I attempted to contact support but they said I have a high amount of refund requests despite never using the app.
924,..Do not order from this company.
924,They will not support you if something goes wrong and will wrongfully take your money.
1233,I tried to place two orders yesterday and both were cancelled because both of the businesses were closed yet they were still available on the app.
1233,The money was taken out of my account.
1233,"Fast forward to today, I'm having pain and discomfort so I order what I needed from cvs and it's delivered to the wrong place."
1233,I text'd contact support and showed them the picture the dasher send of the mat and door they delivered to.
1233,I also sent a picture of my mat to prove they delivered to the wrong place.
1233,They told me my case was under review and someone would make contact with me in 24 hours.
1233,I ordered medicine for pain to be delivered so I wouldn't have to go get it myself.
1233,It was the dashers mistake but they refused to just resend my order.
1233,"Three issues within two days, that's too frequent."
1233,I'm deleting the app and choosing another option.
1233,This is ridiculous.
95,"System works great, food is always good and the communication of my order status is top notch, but there are just way too many fees."
95,"You have to pay a delivery fee, a service fee, a tip, and the price of the food is higher on Grubhub than you would pay at the restaurant."
95,Add the monthly fee to that and it's just crazy how much you're paying if you keep track!
95,We only use Grubhub when we can't go pick up ourselves for some reason.
984,"They allowed me to purchase there subscription service, Uber One, without verifying my CVV, which is fine, because I lose my cards all the time."
984,"The funny thing is, right after that, they would not allow me to purchase food without verification."
984,"So I was able to set myself up for a monthly fee, which I was entice to do becauseI was going to save on the order I was currently making, then I was not allowed to make that order."
984,"Also, it just doesn't have nearly as many options as DoorDash!!"
984,!
800,"My experience has been very good, .Most drivers arrive on time, .My food is never tempered with, .I always tip well if I get 100% everything I ordered, I know late nights can get frustrating and tiring but us people that order appreciate you and all you do to make this experience the best so I thank you for that."
800,.Your all doing a wonderful job
96,I never had a bad experience until this week.
96,I ordered some food thinking it was close by so I could pick up- it wasnt.
96,.Therefore I cancelled the food.
96,"They wouldnt refund my money so I chatted w customer service, Hugo, and somehow the chat ended before I could make a choice."
96,.They sent me a $15 coupon that I could only use IF I purchased something $15+ without taxes and fees.
96,That means I would be paying more money!
96,".I talked to another lady to sort it out, Brittany L, and before I could answer she ended the chat on me too."
96,Absolutely terrible customer service.
96,She gave me 10 secs to reply back before ending.
96,If only I could post the ss.
570,Both the app and the service are terrible in my experience.
570,"I just gave them another try after a bad experience a while back, and it was a total fail."
570,"I didn't receive a notification from the app when the driver tried to contact me even though notifications were enabled (got a robocall instead), yet when I called the driver via the app they simply wouldn't answer."
570,"The app told me I could leave a message, yet repeated calls just disconnected me."
570,"My internet/phone signal was strong, so it wasn't that."
570,"My order status switched to ""delivered"", yet the food was never delivered."
570,"The driver simply wouldn't answer their phone, and the app gave me no way to actually contact a human being."
570,"It offered to refund what I paid, but my dad and I were left without dinner, and the promo credit I used was not given back."
570,By this point the restaurants near me were closed and it pretty much messed up our evening.
570,Never again.
1109,I don't know why everyone's complaining in their reviews.
1109,I've never had a bad experience with postmates and I use it literally everyday.
1324,"Most of the orders I have placed on the app had been cancelled because the restaurants had supposedly been closed; sometimes the restaurants are actually still open, OR a driver will arrive at the restaurant and it will be closed."
1324,How is the app not aware of the hours of the locations that they service??
1324,And how come it often lets me add menu items toy cart and then tell me AFTER that the place is closed.
1324,"They also don't allow you to tip afterwards, which to me is completely unacceptable."
1324,Nothing but bad experiences.
1324,0/5...Also absolutely ridiculous to charge huge fees on top of the items already being priced higher on the app.
1324,My most recent order that would normally be a 15$ meal if you pick it up yourself costed me 40$ through the app.
480,Extremely unprofessional and full of bugs.
480,Every single delivery was +1 hour late.
480,"I send messages through the customer service chat, and there is a bug: as soon as they respond, I automatically get a message saying that I did not respond, and they close the chat."
1293,If you want real advice take it right here it's waaaay better if you go by yourself grab your food and take it home then using this app but if you can't go grab the food yourself use this I only rated it one star because of the tax that's thrown on here for no reason I can't even tip the DoorDash driver bc 10 dollars gets added on every meal you order to sum up the story / if you absolutely can't get the food yourself use this app but if you can then absolutely do NOT use this app you'll waste waay more money on tax than gas using this.
1293,This app can also just help you find other places to eat and what the menus and prices will be I keep it on my phone just in case I'm ever in a situation where I have into use it but I barley ever use this app because of the money tax
9,I agree with the reviewer who said that customer service only response is to refund your $ but not to make it right..
9,"In this post Covid job apocalypseIt would be better if a company with his big name in food delivery as GrubHub, would value their drivers and delivery people a little higher and give them credit for doing the job that they are doing."
9,I wouldn't do the job myself but I'm glad there are people who do since I am a handicap shut in..But I've struggled with Walmart over almost 3 months to get them to honor the price quoted by one of their vendors.
9,Apparently there are no companies anymore who value and honor their employees.
9,The bigger they are the less they care.
9,.I wish there were someone out there who would create a delivery service where the money went all to the restaurant and  drivers and all the service did was broker their services..Alas we do not live in that world.
9,For whatever it's worth GrubHub seems to serve things up just as well as any other delivery service I had to use.
15,I have had to deal with their customer service several times.
15,They have all been horrible experiences.
15,There is no empathy to anyones situation and their solutions are laughable.
15,Tonight we placed an order and 10 minutes later I got a notification that it was cancelled and then a phone call letting me know my order was cancelled due to a restaurant error and I would get a refund within 5 days.
15,We made other plans for dinner and we're sitting down to eat 40 minutes later when my phone rang and it was the restaurant that we originally ordered from asking if we were coming to pick up the order.
15,I guess Grubhub cancelled it on their own without telling the restaurant.
15,"I apologized as if I knew, I would have gone over and picked it up myself."
15,"I went and read the email Grubhub sent and they stated it was a delivery error, but customer service blamed it on the restaurant."
15,This is horrible for both the consumer and the restaurant that lost the money for food they prepared.
15,"We've had so many issues, but I won't be wasting money on this anymore."
24,Where is the accountability from Grubhub when mistakes are made?
24,You delivered the wrong order to my home this morning.
24,I call you and tell you what happened and you tell me you've refunded the order and that's all you can do.
24,We call the restaurant and our order is just sitting there.
24,I ask why you can't deliver my order?
24,Customer service says once the order has been marked as delivered there is nothing they can do.
24,Absolute trash of a service you provide Grubhub.
24,"Make the order right, send the driver to go back and pick up my correct order??"
24,"I didn't call you for funsies, your job was to deliver to my food and a mistake was made."
24,Why is Grubhub not able to make good on their end??
24,Last time we use your service Grubhub.
24,Corporate pigs at their finest.
24,Talked to customer service and waited for over an hour after our wrong order was delivered to finally get someone on the phone who also wouldn't accept any accountability.
38,"Placed an order and waited 2 and a half hours, called the restaurant and was told the food was picked up a while ago, I couldn't reach the driver nor the restaurant could..When I chatted with customer service twice,.No one could reach the driver or call the restaurant, the restaurant blamed GrubHub and GrubHub blamed the restaurant."
38,"At this point my food was already cold 2.5 hours later- I asked for a refund and an email to write a complaint, BUT the chat was ended by the representative."
38,Uber would have NEVER done this.
38,"The restaurant reported that the driver PICKED UP the order, but the driver CANCELLED IT- which means he got to enjoy my dinner instead… and GrubHub still said it was getting delivered."
38,As it is now.
38,"So safe to say, someone stole my food, a GrubHub employee, so I will never be trusting this company again."
38,".No help,  no support, no nothing..Horrible service."
38,Save yourself the trouble.
44,GrubHub has no control over your order.
44,They are just there to take a fee.
44,"Customer service is very polite, but useless."
44,"Once you place an order, you have to hope for the best."
44,"Maybe it will be there on time, maybe it will be an hour late."
44,"Maybe your courier will pick up your order when it is ready or take a nap, grab some lunch, take a few trips via some ride app or just sit at home watching tv and cancel 45 minutes after your food was ready."
44,"You can't blame the restaurant, can't switch drivers even if they aren't moving for 30 minutes, and you can't edit a tip."
44,"Even if you could edit the tip, the person who made you wait an extra hour canceled so you would be punishing an innocent courier."
45,I've tried multiple times with this company.
45,So many times they string you along with an order and tell you someone is on their way when in truth there's no one coming and the order isn't on its way.
45,And nearly all of not all orders that do make it have issues.
45,"This is the worst, in my experience, of any of the delivery apps."
45,"And barring the Bezos investment, I fully expect this company to fail."
45,The product and service is terrible.
45,The customer service is terrible.
45,And I don't need to sell it any harder than that.
45,"As soon as anyone uses it, they will realize how bad it is and be sad about the fact they've downloaded it at all."
45,"Jeff, wish you would have brought us something, but this company is terrible."
45,"Its customer service is terrible, and it's a drag on your brand."
47,Had to make a second account to order food because my account that I only had access to was disabled because they felt like it just for them to do it a second time.
47,"When I reach out for assistance I get a sorry there is nothing we can for you besides give you the run around and make you wait for a response from a special department that has no name that will never be received as I am still waiting for the response from my first account which was stated to be sent within 48 hours from the time Grubhub decided to disable my account, that was about a month ago."
47,This app is not worth time time.
47,Stuck with UberEats they might be a lil more expensive but they are more professional.
47,Especially their customer service.
47,Do better GrubHub
55,"The app works fine, which is why I gave it 3 stars, however there is a severe lack of customer service."
55,"If your order is wrong, it just refunds the cost of the item that is wrong."
55,You have to hunt for the chat option and they can't do anything but recite what the GH+ membership includes.
55,What if I wanted the correct food still?
55,What about the service fees?
55,I just spent $20 on food that I can't eat and had to give to a coworker because it was incorrectly made and I have dietary restrictions.
55,But I got $8 back so apparently that's fair.
55,This is where there is a monumental difference between GH and DoorDash.
55,I will be going back to DD.
56,I ordered from a cookie place and it said it was going to be here in like 30-45 mins so I was like ok.
56,It has passed an hour and some minutes since I ordered and I called the cookie place I ordered from and they said they couldn't do anything so I called the customer service number and it TOOK SO LONG for the lady to give me my money back.
56,The next day we went outside and the cookies were on the ground.
56,"Mind you, I kept going outside to check to see if they were there."
56,When the cookies got there the delivery guy could have at least knocked on the door but instead they decided to come at like 3:00 in the morning and sit them by the door.
56,I was up all night so I could have gone down there to get them.
56,They have terrible customer service…
61,If you are a restaurant.. don't .If you are a consumer.. there are others Seamless isn't the one.
61,..5 stars to get attention.
61,This deserves one star.
61,Customer service is insanely horrible.
61,..This last experience resulted in this review.
61,I've been disconnected from customer service and have had questions that were refused to be answered.
61,..This time was hilarious.
61,"..My driver gave us a pizza from another restaurant, the wrong size and cold."
61,"No problem, but going to customer service was crazier."
61,"I asked for a refund, the asked if I could get the $$ right away to use I also asked if they had expedited delivery on Seamless."
61,"This person told me they couldn't refund, I'd have to wait 3-5 days.. fine, what's the total?"
61,I was told to check my email..
61,"..I asked what about my other question.. this person answered,""nothing."""
61,..Nothing?
61,Lol hilarious.. ..Seamless is horrible
75,"Over 5 times I ordered from Grubhub, the drivers pick up the food and cancel the order when they get close enough to you, they actually get to keep your food."
75,"The other times they delivery driver calls me to drive to them to pick up my food, whats the point of the delivery if I have to drove to pick it up."
75,Worse food delivery service and I will never ever use their service again.
75,Customer Service is no help either.
80,"I ordered food and when I went to check the status near the time of my provided delivery window, it had said it had been delivered 30 minutes before."
80,I checked all around the house and at all the neighbors and nothing.
80,I was unable to go back and see my driver or rate them or anything and customer service was not able to give me any information on what happened.
80,I didn't receive any updates despite having text updates on.
80,Customer service only offered to reorder my food which also arrived late.
80,..I will never use grubhub and will also tell anyone who listens to use a different app.
84,"I had three separate orders to three different places canceled over an hour after I placed the orders, after the drivers drove all the way over to pick it up."
84,This was in the same night because I kept trying different places.
84,"Restaurants confirm orders, and then when the drivers get there they don't have the items that they confirm they have and just cancel the order on you."
84,The customer service representatives offer to do nothing to help you and don't care.
84,The drivers don't communicate when you reach out to them.
84,No one calls to ask about substitutions.
84,The whole thing is a waste of time and money.
90,9/10 times you place an order on this app it'll be wrong.
90,"That's not including missing utensils/straws (that almost always happens), I'm talking strictly about the food."
90,"It's good that the refunds are quick, but it gets tiring to always have to deal with a problem whenever your order arrives."
90,"I've only ever had my order show up correctly a few times, and at this point I'm thinking of trying a different service...EDIT: The link customer service responded to this post with doesn't work, that should about sum up the disfunction I'm talking about"
109,"In the past, I've had restaurant issues delivering the wrong order or missing part of the order, or even no-order and GrubHub has always been very RELIABLE in correcting or solving or just making it right with me."
109,Good customer service goes a long way- a quality that's hard to find now a days.
109,Keep up the good work GrubHub.
113,There is no customer service.
113,"The number they list is a mailbox that says, we don't monitor this mailbox."
113,Call it.
113,If I didn't have a problem it would be hilarious.
113,They only take your money and no way to fix a problem.
113,$$$ gone.
113,They happily answer and email if you want to use them for something tho.
113,I wish I read the reviews before I used them for something.
113,Don't believe anything about a customer service number or email.
113,They send you to a FAQ which doesn't solve anything.
113,Apple should delete then from there store.
124,Longtime Grubhub user.
124,The current customer service is beyond awful.
124,Food is never delivered on time (and the estimated wait/delivery windows are regularly changed without notice to make it look like deliveries aren't late when they always are).
124,"Reached my limit this evening with a driver who didn't even try to deliver my food—parked nearby, marked the order as ""delivered"" and left."
124,After waiting 1 hr+.
124,Couldn't even get through to a person at Grubhub customer support.
124,"One star for GH, zero stars for that driver."
124,"App uninstalled, won't be back."
134,First time ever using this app..I order over $31 worth of food.
134,".The driver (named Sartu) put a notification in that my food was delivered to me when in fact it wasn't..I contact customer service, I give them the drivers name, I told them that I tried to call and text the driver several times, and the driver never responded..They their response is ""sorry"" because they can't get in touch with the driver either do they say..So what you're telling me is this company allows people to take peoples money, and tell them nothing about the delivery, whether it was lost or stolen, or just not delivered at all..I'm  truck driver you can bet  I'll be sure to tell every truck driver in this facility not to do business with you....You basically took my money so you can tell me that you'll refund it to me 3 to 5 days later."
139,I want to start by saying I don't have to speak to customer service often but I'm always pleased with my experience from Grubhub support.
139,They are prompt and helpful and they always do something to make the customers feel most important.
139,Thank you for your hard work!
139,!
141,Tried to order food 3 times from the same restaurant because drivers kept getting lost and cancelling the order.
141,"Apparently when you contact customer service and try to explain the situation, they will just cancel your grubhub+ membership and not tell you."
141,"Then when you find out and call them on it, they tell you to ""check for fraudulent activity"" and that there's nothing they can do to refund you or reinstate your membership."
141,"Joke of a company, and I thought ubereats was bad."
164,When you hire just any body to deliver your food you're going to run into issues.
164,"However - Grubhub has the worst in app help out of any food delivery service, and 0 actual customer service."
164,"So when something inevitably goes wrong you are basically just screwed!..Also got charged 5+ times because their system is crap and had a closed restaurant showing up, but the app kept crashing instead of saying the restaurant was closed."
164,Jesus christ get it together.
174,Customer service is terrible.
174,"The ""customer service"" rep who identified themself as ""Frances NP"" was not helpful in anyway."
174,"""Frances NP"" was, however, short with me, rude, and in no way cares about the customer."
174,.My driver refused to communicate with me.
174,She was told by the restaurant to wait 2 minutes.
174,The driver did not.
174,My order was ready but Grubhub decided to delay the delivery for an hour.
174,I went and picked it up myself so it would be hot when we ate it.
174,"I told all of this to ""Frances NP"" and they were zero help and blatantly didn't care."
188,Had issue right after I placed an order and I realized the place was closed.
188,Jumped on chat support and was refunded in mins with a $15 credit for the hours not being updated!
188,It's always impressive to great and speedy customer service!
206,Once again our order was only half delivered.
206,We called the pizza place and the first thing they asked was did you use Grubhub and that they've had nothing but problems with drivers stealing food and messing up orders.
206,When a restaurant begs customers not to use a service that makes them money you know there's a problem.
206,Grubhub customer service doesn't care in the slightest.
206,"So that's it, we won't be using Grubhub for delivery anymore."
209,I've had too many orders change the delivery time.
209,"Worst part is that GrubHub has a policy that says ""Food late, we'll give you a voucher"" but they change the delivery time before you can even put that option in."
209,Customer service is hit or miss.
209,Honestly you're better off with UberEats or DoorDash.
217,I like Grubhub.
217,I order a few times a week through the app in spite of any issues that may arise.
217,".Firstly, their customer service is really outstanding."
217,Each person tries their best to respectfully solve your issue.
217,.I have to mention the prices are quite high and by the time you come out of the app you are paying a pretty penny for your food.
217,.Many of the restaurant employees don't read the order properly either.
217,".Lastly, time is never a priority."
217,The drivers often come from all over to bring the food and by the time it gets here it's cold.
217,.In spite of all this Grubhub is the best app.
217,And by all but a few dollars worth the price.
218,After being delayed once I looked back on the map and the driver still wasn't going to the store.
218,"Contacted customer service, said it would be around 30 more minutes (another delay)."
218,I had so much time to think about how lazy I am and decided to get get it myself.
218,"God as my witness the restaurant was 5 minutes to my house, terrible all around."
218,First time using Grubhub too.
218,Despite doordash having a terrible menu it's much more efficient.
223,"I Order 30 minutes before the store was supposed to close, when the driver got there they told them they didn't make the order, driver leaves I never get my order, after 50 minutes of waiting I contacted customer service to find out they cancelled it because it wasn't made and I don't find out till 30 minutes after I was supposed to get my order and only because I contacted them"
236,"I was waiting outside for my delivery driver, she barely answer the phone to follow my instructions to the delivery, marked the order as delivered and just ran away with my food, never returned the food to the restaurant and establishment has confirmed has happened twice."
236,If you contact customer service they just cancelled the order and erase any proof of the robbery.
236,Very disappointed since I've been ordering a lot of food without issues before.
243,I'm sick and tired of drivers not delivering food.
243,I was told my address was incorrect when in reality the driver was at the wrong part of the complex.
243,"When I contacted customer service, they gave me 60 days free of some perk, which I told him I didn't want but she was not helpful in getting my food reordered."
243,I am done with these food delivery apps because there have been too many issues and not enough accountability for the drivers.
250,My account got hacked.
250,Someone placed an unauthorized ordered and then updated the email address to theirs.
250,So I wasn't able to login mine again.
250,"Called customer service, they were trying to send the reset password to the associate account which has already been changed!"
250,But they just didn't understand that and kept saying I sent a password reset to your email.
250,Will never use the app again!
257,Two terrible GrubHub experiences.
257,"First one, took them over an hour to deliver and kept updating the delivery time."
257,"Second time, the menu for the restaurant was incorrect, they called and told me I had to cancel and it took customer service 30 minutes to cancel and refund me...Only using this because of a giftcard and I will never use this again."
257,I've never had any of these issues with DoorDash.
261,My account was hacked and an order for $65 worth of food was places.
261,I contacted their customer service 3 times.
261,I was told each time the situation would be escalated and told I'd be contacted within 24 to 48 hours.
261,I was never contacted.
261,Customer support has done absolutely nothing to assist me with this fraudulent order.
261,I am deleting my account and contesting the charge with my bank.
261,Totally inexcusable.
261,Three times I was ignored.
264,"My order was wrong, I contacted customer service and they immediately fixed my order."
266,I kept going back and giving it another try to only continue to not get what I ordered.
266,"How difficult is it to order food, have a delivery person drive to the restaurant, check the order and deliver it?"
266,Turns out it's almost impossible.
266,The customer service is a joke.
266,Nobody seems to care about service anymore.
267,Every week my coworkers and I order for delivery.
267,I am sitting at my fourth consecutive cancelled order from GrubHub+.
267,The order is always cancelled at expected time of delivery with various reasons having been emailed to me but when I call customer service I'm told the underlying issue is error in app communicating to store.
267,".If you want food delivered, don't download this app."
267,"Great on giving refunds, terrible at delivering food."
272,"The app serves its purpose most of the time, but my address has been wrong for MONTHS, and I've been going back and forth with customer service, but gotten no help."
272,"..I've put instructions in for drivers, but about half the time, they are ignored."
297,Horrible customer service and drivers.
297,"Out of 3 times trying this app, (because Amazon's free plus subscription), I only ever got 1 delivery."
297,Customer service didn't help.
297,"Wouldn't re deliver, wouldn't contact the driver, wouldn't even let me send screenshots of the texts the driver had sent."
297,"The second time, it just never showed up."
297,The driver ghosted?
297,".Don't waste your time, you'll end up hangry and frustrated."
306,App is fine.
306,Customer service is awful.
306,My account was hacked and I had to contact them 4 times with no resolution.
306,I've used other services for years and those services will fix/refund my items immediately and resolve my issues via chat directly.
306,"With Grubhub, not only was my information compromised but they were absolutely no help when it happened."
311,Terrible company.
311,The drivers do their job fairly well BUT - many mistakes - wrong orders - an hour or more wait - no refund on undelivered orders - no contact or try to fix the situation.
311,Ignore complaints.
311,POOR POOR POOR way of running a business.
311,Will NEVER NEVER use again and will inform others.
311,Actually less than ZERO.
311,Cost me money - lost meals and much stress.
311,Always anout the MONEY- what happened to GOOD CUSTOMER SERVICE!!!
311,None here.👹👹🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬
322,Tried using the app more than a few times in El Paso Tx area and my food was always more than an hour late.
322,Didn't matter if I ordered less than a mile away it was always late.
322,When I reached out to customer service they would give me $5-$10 credit for the late delivery.
322,Totally didn't make up for the cold fries and watered down drinks.
322,Gonna try doordash.
327,Been using Grubhub for 6 years and there is a 50/50 chance my order will be cancelled every single time I use this app.
327,The customer service people are absolutely no help and they're pretty snarky and rude on top of that.
327,"Why even bother paying for a + membership for a company that doesn't fulfill their orders and then doesn't offer any solutions besides ""Oops sorry""."
327,Going to Doordash ✌️
337,Everyone note this shows Ty company sends credits on through codes to your email.
337,Nothing actually goes through to your account in the hopes that it gets lost in spam folders or other emails.
337,Please remember to try pull one over on them as much as possible as they will continuously try to screw you with there awful customer service responses!
344,My account was suspended for no reason whatsoever.
344,I was not allowed to order anything from anywhere even though my payment went through.
344,They kept refunding me on every order.
344,When I called customer service they said they could not tell me want my account was suspended.
344,Such bad service and customer care.
344,So disappointed.
359,Grubhub is very poorly run here in North Texas.
359,"The lack of drivers, poor customer service, very long delivery delays are not worth a consumers time and aggravation."
359,How can a convenience service be so inconvenient?
359,Until Grubhub gets their act together in switching to another service.
359,My order took over an hour and a half to be delivered which is unacceptable.
359,"It's not on the restaurant, it's on Grubhub."
366,"They don't even have drivers to deliver your food and when you reach out to customer service, they're no help whatsoever and actually super rude."
366,This company has a lot of problems.
366,Don't see it making it much longer unless they make big changes.
366,There are way better alternatives to this app.
387,Incorrect order (which happens) but then followed by a poor customer service to which my chat was ended by the rep because I couldn't respond quickly enough.
387,"To summarize: we ordered 4 items, they delivered one, charged us $20 for it and said it was company policy."
387,Last time using this service.
387,👎👎
401,"Best customer service, user friendly interface and supports restaurants."
404,"I chatted with a customer service rep, Zachary V. He was terrible to work with, should definitely not be working in customer service."
404,"Didn't issue the credit he told me he would, refused to cancel an order even though they hadn't even made the food yet."
404,Very disappointed in the quality coming from Grubhub lately
428,My order never arrived and I was not given the option to contact the driver after it said it was delivered.
428,"I contacted customer service and they said they would give me a refund, but they just gave me credit for the app, but not equal to the amount i spent on the incomplete order."
428,Overall really disappointed and hangry.
442,My issue is that the delivery drivers never follow the directions has I put them in the system.
442,..I never want my food left on the door step.
442,It's crap customer service and when ever you try to talk to somebody about any issue it never works out.
444,"Glitchy app, customer service non-existent."
444,One star is actually too generous.
444,"I have now tried to get my issue resolved three times using their chart help service, which most of the time leads to no response and even when it does has been useless."
444,Worst experience I've ever had with an app of any kind.
449,Frequently late with customer service that has one response.
449,Have a $5 or $10 coupon.
449,They also have absurd fees tacked on top of upcharges on the food.
449,Other than that it's a delivery service.
468,"I AM DONE WITH THESE GUYS!..I've used them for years and every once in awhile they'd forget an item, now it's happening every time!.I asked for them to deliver the food that was missing since I already paid the obscene fees and charges, but they'll only do a refund, then when it came to a refund, they wouldn't give it to me because of too many complaints… HOW THE F IS THAT MY FAULT!"
468,"?.So I told them I will never use them again, and the customer service manager said she didn't care… really?"
468,"I spend on average $1200 a month with them, so I guess that's not enough?..BYE!!"
468,!
482,"Horrible delivery drivers who leave your food where ever without contacting you, and horrible customer service when you call or use their chat."
482,Problem keeps happening again and again and they never help or really do anything
551,I placed an order today but canceled it shortly after I placed the order.
551,"Before and when I hit the cancel button, the app did not say I would still be charged if I cancel the order."
551,I was told that I have been be charged of $147 after the cancellation was completed.
551,I contacted their customer service right away and asked the representative to reinstate my order if the restaurant had already prepared my order.
551,"However, the customer service lady came back and told me that they are unable to reinstate my order nor issue me the refund."
551,"I called the restaurant too but the restaurant told me that since I canceled the order, they will not be paid by Uber."
551,"In other words, Uber stole my money without fulfill my order nor paid the restaurant."
551,I am going to file a class lawsuit against them because I believe this is not legit.
551,The customer service rep said the manager will contact when I requested to escalate this issue but they never did.
551,Stay away from UberEats!
557,I order through this app at least 2 times a day.
557,"Usually I have no issue but when I do have an issue, they have very bad customer service."
557,I had an order that got delayed 3 times.
557,From 8:15 to 8:30 to 8:45 to then 9...When I complained about the delayed order the customer service would not even acknowledge that the order is late.
557,After repeating multiple times they offered me $5 for compensation.
557,How is that ok?
557,I should just be happy with $5?
557,"No apology, no acceptance of responsibility and no respect for my time?"
557,How is that fair to someone who is a member and orders daily?..There is no option to make complaints and the customer reps would not let me escalate the issue to a complaint.
557,There is no option at all.
557,Absolutely horrible service.
557,I discontinued my membership at that point because it really gives me no value.
557,It's not about just the money but customers want to know they are valued.
557,Specially when they have been loyal to you for years.
557,ABSOLUTELY HORRIBLE SERVICE.
557,"..Since I cannot make any impact in their business, because there is no option for anyone to make a formal complaint, I decided to write this review, hoping they change."
557,"They used to be good and trustworthy but not anymore...I hope you have a better experience than I did, sincerely!"
557,Best of luck but I am out.
557,I will keep looking for an app that actually treats their customers right.
576,Overall the restaurants and delivery is decent.
576,But the customer service/assistance is just horrible.
576,Although online it's said you'll only be charged an order after cancelling if a driver has already been assigned to your order.
576,"However, I had cancelled my order because I had forgotten a few items I wanted to add (not even 5 mins after I had placed it) and no driver had been assigned either so I didn't think it would be a problem."
576,I ended up being charged anyway for the order and delivery which was about $30 and their solution was for me to place another order as in wasting 60$ in total when I didn't receive anything at all from the first order.
576,It was just overall frustrating especially as a new customer that it's too familiar.
584,I am BEYOND upset!
584,I have been waiting for OVER an hour that has NEVER EVEN BEEN DELIVERED… I tried contacting the driver MULTIPLE times with no response and I'm here with my daughters who now don't have dinner and I don't know what to do this is BEYOND bad customer service!!!
584,I am livid at this point that someone would say they deliver food and has probably just kept it for themselves which is why they didn't leave a photo or anything!
584,Upon calling support they told me the couldn't confirm with the driver that the order was delivered nor could they process a refund because I requested a refund for over cooked food in the past.
584,I am extremely upset as I spent my last $20 to feed my children and myself and they don't even offer the common courtesy of redelivery as I am NOT asking for a refund.
584,DO NOT use this app I now have no food and no money left to order dinner… I am disgusted by my treatment!
599,The driver who brought my order only brought one of the two bags of groceries.
599,All items were on the printed receipt.
599,He looked around the car and shrugged his shoulders.
599,He asked to look at the store address on the receipt that he'd figure it out.
599,"5 minutes later, he knocks on my door and says he can't find the store address online and to just contact customer service for a refund."
599,Are you kidding me?
599,It took 20 minutes to correspond with customer service in a selective one-way text.
599,I had only one opportunity to write my issue.
599,Good thing I'm a person of many words and details!
599,I want that driver's tip back too.
599,Not because I'm cheap (I wouldn't be buying groceries online if I was cheap) but because he doesn't deserve it.
599,Customer service said he'd initiate the refund and still I have the full grocery and tip charges.
611,"The customer service chat are awful!.I'm a disabled person and they won't even give you time to type out your issue before they hang up in chat, so you have to try and reach them again, which means you have to wait in line/on hold again for 10 -20 min and or longer only for them to hang up on you again after I have managed to type ""please be patient with me as I try to type I'm BLIND."
611,"""I continue to try and type what the issue is and again they hang up on me in chat!"
611,"I feel very frustrated , disappointed and DISCRIMINATED against!"
611,"As if I don't matter , tho I mattered enough for them to charge me $30 for a bowl of soup but I don't matter enough to tell them I NEVER RECEIVED MY MEAL!"
611,.They hang up chat when you ask to speak with a supervisor.
611,Who feels like going through all of this just to try and get a meal!
618,"They took my money because my dasher mixed up my order (I didn't want the refund, just the food because it was the first night of football and a new job) and they said 5 days refund."
618,Call the customer service number today after the required 5 days and they ended the call and said this matter better regarded for another party but nothing from their management.
618,I am so distraught and frustrated.
618,Why punish the consumer?
618,I love the product in previous but now I have no faith in this service going further.
618,Thank you.
631,"App works well, delivery drivers are great."
631,Where they fail is customer service!
631,I placed an order with a chain barbecue fast food restaurant and part of that order was a bottle of their barbecue sauce.
631,The restaurant was out of the bottled sauce and told the driver I would need to request a refund.
631,I submitted for the refund and was declined.
631,After speaking to  the agent I keep getting the same copy and paste explanation about how I'm not getting my money back.
631,I told them to call the driver and she will tell them it was not in my order.
631,I also included the receipt that the person packaging my order was obviously using because all the items missing from my order were not checked off and everything that was actually included was checked off..This company is dead to me and I will never use them again.
672,If your order is wrong.
672,You have to pay an additional delivery fee and tip to get it corrected.
672,Customer service is a joke.
672,It took them 3 hours of going back and forth discussing this issue.
672,Then they told me to contact them when I ordered within an hour of the original order.
672,It was already three hours later that you told me this!
672,Well after an hour after the order.
672,"When I reordered and contacted Uber, they said they can't help because it was past an hour after the order."
672,Really?
672,There is no point to using this service.
672,When you have an issue you get no real help to set everything right.
672,I should not have to pay more money to get my order corrected.
678,They charged me for an order I canceled.
678,I asked for customer service because I canceled said order not even a minute after I ordered it (took three days of repeat questioning to even get an agent and when they answered they said the restaurant was already preparing the order and closed the chat).
678,They said the restaurant (Dunkin) was already preparing my order.
678,However when my friend tried to order from them they said they were too busy to take delivery orders.
678,On the same app within the same minute.
678,I heavily doubt they had started on my order.
678,"Not to mention I just ordered donuts, Dunkin doesn't make donuts to order so it's not like it was special items."
732,I've never used this until today.
732,My friend is always raving about this delivery app so I wanted to give it a try and I also had a 25 dollar off coupon and free delivery so I thought why not!
732,Wrong.
732,I put in the right address but took the driver to a completely different place..was on the phone with the driver trying to look for him but he couldn't do anything about the order.
732,He had to cancel and I wanted to get a refund but customer service wait was long and the wait time kept getting bigger and higher.
762,Worst experience I have ever had ordering food and worst customer service.
762,I made an order at about 2:00 am which I was told would take 30 mins.
762,When I finally paid and ordered it told me 3:10 the latest which I was not happy about but decided to wait.
762,At 3:00 am the app told me the food would be arriving at 3:50 which was over an hour after the original delivery time.
762,"I decided to cancel because I needed to sleep, and was charged almost the full price of the meal."
762,Absolutely ridiculous and an embarrassment to this company.
762,I need a full refund for this.
762,( honestly plus more for all of the trouble and no meal delivered.)
764,I've been using ubereats and Uber throughout my college life.
764,"Went to London for exchange program, I still used the app because I loved its great reward program and its reliability."
764,"Ironically, after 5 yrs of purchasing membership and accumulating over 80k+ dollars spent on the app, Uber decided to cancel its loyalty point redeeming system."
764,"With the increasing service fee and the disappearing discounts, I feel so disappointed towards the app."
764,"Customer services cannot explain their ""newest Uber one loyalty program"" properly; all they could say was ""ah please check updates""."
764,"I wonder if this app lost its most fundamental loyalty customer, how will they attract new ones?"
764,?
769,"When you first buy food it's fine and works great, until you accidentally get the wrong order."
769,This happened to me and i tried to contact customer service.
769,They told they couldn't do anything and sent me to a higher team.
769,That team then emailed me saying my account was deactivated.
769,"So i can't place orders or use the app, but I can still pay for Uber pass and put credits in my wallet."
769,They only want your money and if i can rate uber zero stars I would.
769,If you want a nice app for food service I recommend doordash .
769,I've never had a problem with them and they have a nice reliable customer service.
773,I'm sure they're losing tons on quality and service issues and it seems the issue is company wide and no one seems to know how to fix it or maybe they just don't want to.
773,No drivers use hot bags so it's almost a guarantee that your food will be colder than it would be compared to a competitor.
773,..I've ordered maybe 10 times from them.
773,Different places different drivers.
773,MOST orders arrive cold.
773,If I were at a restaurant and it were served to me I would leave and I would never come back.
773,Maybe Uber customer service should take a look at the pretty sharp decline of Uber's stock price.
773,It's not a coincidence.
773,..Deleting my data.
786,My daughter is in college away from home and sick.
786,"I ordered some medicine, soup and AAA batteries for her fireStick remote."
786,"The Uber driver messaged saying some items wasn't available, but sent pictures of what was available."
786,I called her and told her which items to get and what not to get.
786,The Uber driver still took it upon herself to still get the items that I didn't want which was the soup.
786,They didn't have chicken noodle soup so I said forget the soup she instead got clam chowder.
786,I asked for AAA batteries but instead got AA Batteries.
786,.You can't even find a customer service number to even call anyone to make a complaint.
786,So not satisfied
797,Worst customer service ever .
797,Literally have had to repeat my problem multiple times with inhuman bot like responses not solving the issue for over 3 months!
797,I got falsely signe up for a subscription and contested it and had it cancelled and even was sent a refund by Uber and then the following two months they attempted to bill me after I had already cancelled and also received a refund .
797,Been trying to communicate and have basically been ignored .
797,Horrible customer service and they themselves are preventing me from um using the app.
797,Now probably never will again .
798,"They used to be great, now?"
798,They have the WORST customer service imaginable.
798,All they do is give you soulless platitudes.
798,They don't care about you in the slightest.
798,"I pay for Uber one, I often pay for priority delivery, and even still, my food always arrives at LEAST an hour after it was promised it would be delivered."
798,"It takes forever to get a driver, and when you complain to customer service, they do NOTHING to help you."
798,"I never do reviews, but I've had back to back to back issues over the course of just one week, and not a single thing as been done to improve, in fact they've only gotten worse"
804,I have had a decent experience most of the time but I often have missing food items and then myself and the people I am ordering for are just out of luck and have to go somewhere else to get food and they will refund the food cost but not delivery or fees.
804,"Or the food comes and it's wrong or half of your coffee is missing, spilled, dripping out of the bag and customer service tells you it's not their problem that you just paid $25 for a cup of coffee that you didn't even get … bad customer service."
804,:-/
807,"I stayed up whole night to finish a school project, and hope to order a lunch on ubereats."
807,"The restaurant is 20 mins driving away, but I was too tired to drive."
807,"I placed the order, and a total of 3 drivers was picking up the order then after staying at the restaurant for half an hour, cancel the pickup."
807,"So I waited 3 hours for this :).At last, when I chat with customer service, they just cancel my order, without any refund or coupon."
807,So just wasted my 3 facking hours!
807,I should've just went to bed!
807,I facking stayed up to wait for the delivery!.UBEREATS is a joke.
807,Don't have food delivery service if you are not professional PLEASE!
819,normally the app is fine (it still almost always lies about delivery times).
819,"but out of my last 50 orders, about 5 times the driver doesn't go to the restaurant."
819,just now it happened again.
819,i ordered at 8pm and support forced me to wait until 9:30 before allowing me to cancel.
819,"it's absolutely silly to not be compensated after being hungry for 1.5 hours, you've basically given them a free loan in exchange for being hungry and a wrench thrown into your schedule."
819,i even pay for Uber One.
819,"all the agents are fine, but the design of their customer service is pathetic"
858,I placed an order and it got delayed like for 2 hours!
858,The app popped up with a small credit for the delay.
858,"I accepted and waited, but it turned out the order was never delivered!"
858,"What's ridiculous was that when I try to contact customer service for this issue in the app, it shows issue resolved because I took the credit??"
858,"Excuse me, I accepted the credit for a delayed order not a MISSED order!"
858,I have to call customer service to get my refund..because agents from the app just couldn't help with it!
858,Will never use this app again!
865,I had an order cancelled by two different drivers without an explanation after waiting for over an hour for my food.
865,I called to complain and get some explanation and recieved no help from Uber's customer service.
865,Maybe if Uber paid their drivers enough we could get decent service and I wouldn't have had to complain.
865,Instead they rip off users and don't provide any decent assistance when you call.
865,Deleting both Uber apps since I refuse to give them any more of my money if they can't provide consistent service.
880,I used Uber grocery to buy something from a local Safeway.
880,"When I was checking out, the total price was $44 with all fees and taxes included."
880,"But when they processed the final charge, it became $66!!!"
880,"Contacted the customer service and the answer was: whatever number you see at checkout, that's only their ""estimation""."
880,"They're allowed to change it to a higher number based on some ""limited access program"" (which I was not informed at all before placing order)...So, don't trust their price!"
880,They reserved the right to charge you %50 more.
905,They have bad customer service support very rude very disrespectful and don't expect to get your money back even if it is there fault trust me they are not gonna care if you didn't get your food after you made 3 order and all of them were canceled also just a bad app in all I don't understand you have no reimbursement what so ever .
905,Like I started to sue the company honestly they deserve it I see why it's so many glitches no one is doin there jobs filled with a bunch of incompetent not knowing how to do there jobs than no one speaks English .
968,Terrible customer service.
968,Driver said food was delivered at 9:53 but food never arrived.
968,Check all around my property and seen nothing.
968,Reached out to driver just to have my call ignored.
968,Checked cameras from 9:30 up to 10:00 and seen no one drop anything off.
968,Worse part is that I can't even get a human on the phone to voice a concern.
968,"Everything is ""handled"" through the app using predetermined responses."
968,Yes I got a refund but the fact that I can't speak to someone about this is ridiculous.
979,"A couple joke of an app and customer service is hard to get a hold of, they make it nearly impossible to talk to an actual person."
979,"When you do they don't help the issue you might be having, they say sorry then continue to give the same automated response thinking that will help."
979,"Save yourself the time and money and don't get this app, get another delivery service app because this one ain't it."
979,"This was my first time using the app and it will be my last, high disappointment."
983,This app has become so unreliable when it comes to restaurants either not delivering food at all or canceling after waiting 30+ minutes or just arriving way after initially promised or placing the order.
983,Paying for priority on many occasions feels like it's a total scam and they can tell you that the order will be later without giving any restitution customer service is absolutely useless and condescending.
983,it is sad to see such a good company have gone so far downhill.
1000,It's the worst customer service I have ever seen.
1000,".I have to wait for my order for more than 2 hours from a restaurant that is 20 min away, and unfortunately I was having Avery hungry kids with me to be surprised after that with a wrong messy order and we have nothing to eat, then when I contact customer service instead of apologizing there is no response even I had a promotion with $25 they haven't refund it Back."
1000,.It was my first and last time to use this miserable application.
1011,Postmates is the fastest way to go broke ordering delivery.
1011,"We have been customers for a long time now and we pay the yearly ""Unlimited"" service fee in an attempt to make the experience more palatable to our wallet."
1011,"Even when ordering from a place with ""free delivery"" and having an unlimited membership, there are still a ton of extra fees."
1011,Restaurants also get paid 30% less when people use Postmates to order so the restaurants also jack up their prices to cover their losses.
1011,Who pays for all of this?
1011,You/us!
1011,"If you ever have a problem with your order, don't expect any help from customer service."
1011,"They use an automated service first, then pass you off to someone over seas that copy/pastes boiler-plate responses."
1011,"Use another food service company..any other company, actually."
1011,This is by far the worst.
1011,"We are done and have deleted the app, once and for all."
1019,Don't use them for shopping.
1019,The drivers can add anything they want that's not on your list without asking to keep their tips higher and customer service won't do anything.
1019,"I had a lady add items I didn't even order, and they just kept showing me my final receipt I must've order it, but can't provide my original order."
1019,"Luckily you change the tip, but I still have to pay for things I didn't ask for."
1019,"You can't call, you can only chat with people overseas who don't know enough English to understand the issue."
1019,"They're rude and consistently cut the chats prematurely, you have to wait like 30 mins for someone to read what you're issue and then just say sorry, you have the best resolution."
1030,"and they have a limit to how many refunds you can get (even though it's ALWAYS THEIR FAULT), make it impossible to remove tips (although their customer service claims you can), and make it impossible to contact your driver after you contact customer service."
1030,deleted the app tonight because i was missing half my $50 order.
1030,tipped my terrible driver QUIANLING $8 (she literally called me to come get my order and just left when i told her it was wrong) that i will never get back.
1030,wasted lots and lots of money on this app.
1049,I came over her from DoorDash as I way too many orders were wrong and customer services was meh when it came to larger things.
1049,But I feel like vendors treat Postmates better because so far none of my orders have been wrong and the app itself it's a lot easier to navigate.
1055,"Got postmates because they advertised a $10 off deal on my first order, however the deal was never applied to my order."
1055,I spent several days trying to contact customer service but kept hitting a wall.
1055,"Horrible customer support, and I feel misled by their advertising."
1055,Will be using other food delivery services from now on.
1057,Postmate and Uber is jsut a terrible app and company in general.
1057,1.
1057,"They will change your delivery time after you place your order, for example, you will see the delivery time to be 20min, and when you go check your delivery status 20 minutes later, they will say that the estimated delivery time changed to 40 minutes."
1057,2.
1057,Their customer service is terrible and never answers your issue.
1057,They will end the chat before solving the problem.
1064,So I ordered an item from a restaurant.
1064,A different item was delivered.
1064,"Rather than refund me the whole amount, they only refunded me a very small portion of what the total amount was."
1064,"Then, the didn't let me talk to a customer service rep or let me rate the experience in any way."
1064,"Every time I tried to renew my complaint, I just got a message saying that I was refunded this very small amount."
1064,Total let down and fail!
1073,This customer service is horrible.
1073,Instead of just refunding every time an order is wrong why not get to the root of the problem and try to fix getting the order wrong in the first place?
1073,Do the drivers not check?
1073,Does no one check for accuracy?
1073,People order for convenience not to miss half their order.
1073,I really hope to use alternatives to postmates in the future this is ridiculous..
1096,I'm SHOCKED people still use postmates.
1096,"The ""other fees"" total at least $10 per order."
1096,You can just use a different app and not have to pay those...You also wait crazy long times for the delivery person to even be assigned so by the time your food arrives it's cold and gross...Their customer service is HORRIBLE.
1096,"They refuse to fix issues that is their fault (like assigning a delivery person and thus the food being spoiled by the time it arrives)...If you try to cancel an order that's over an hour late, they still charge you $20 for the order!!"
1096,..Postmates is trash.
1096,Stop paying all these crazy fees to keep them afloat so they can steal your money.
1103,They don't care what you tell them as far as instructions and the customer service also doesn't care.
1103,Have had multiple meals ruined because everyone associated with this app just seem to have a DMV level of apathy and disdain for their customers.
1103,Just a trash app.
1103,Do yourself a favor and use DoorDash.
1108,Pricing always competitive and customer service always on point
1110,Could not think of a sadder excuse for a food delivery app.
1110,The customer service doesnt answer texts and barely answered the phone calls.
1110,They overcharged for several items multiple times and refused to fix the issue.
1110,This company clearly only cares about money and not its customers so its a horrible one and deserves to be put out of business.
1114,"Although the restaurants in the area have troubles from time to time, the PostMates Customer Service is puntual and quick to help."
1116,I ordered Jack in the box and had a delivery driver named Meredith.
1116,She did not deliver my food and marked it as delivered so I contacted customer service and they did not give me a refund.
1116,They just apologized and she left with my money and my food and they did not do anything to help me.
1116,Never using postmates again.
1116,Doordash is cheaper when ordering Jack in the box anyways.
1129,I have literally spent hundreds of dollars on this service.
1129,"I have either not received my order, received incorrect items or received items late."
1129,"I have been ""flagged"" because of their inadequate service."
1129,I have had to call my bank multiple times because of the situation.
1129,The latest situation was my requesting cut watermelon and receiving a whole watermelon.
1129,I'm in a hotel and cannot do anything with that!
1129,I cannot say it enough please stay away from this inconsistent service.
1129,"They will refuse to refund you for their errors, you cannot be transferred to a supervisor and have to wait for a callback, you will spend hours on the phone trying to resolve their errors."
1129,I think I have only received 2 orders that were correct and all the other ones were incorrect in one way or another.
1129,Their customer service representatives all use the same canned script when you call to notify them of their errors.
1129,After this latest error I have decided to use a different service.
1129,Word of mouth is the most powerful form of advertising and I plan to share my experiences with as many people I can.
1129,If you look online there are countless lawsuits against them.
1129,"Terrible service, unempowered customer service representatives and they put their customers last."
1129,Terrible.
1140,"Not sure if it's specific to Washington state, but DoorDash is the absolute worst delivery service out of all of them."
1140,They constantly take an hour longer than it initially says to deliver.
1140,I have never once had them within 30 mins of the initial delivery time sent.
1140,"I've also had them literally forget 95% of my order at the restaurant, refuse to refund the delivery fee or the 25% tip I gave."
1140,"I had ordered a pizza from Farrelli's and a side salad, I only received the side salad, the delivery driver dropped it at my door, didn't knock and took off."
1140,Tried to call them to tell them they forgot the majority of my order and ignored my calls.
1140,"Went to pick it up myself, was told by Farrelli's that DoorDash should refund me, it is separate from my order and they have no part in it."
1140,"The DoorDash customer service person was entirely useless, told me it's not on them and they can't refund me and to figure it out with Farrelli's."
1140,I just gave up because it was only $14 and I had already wasted 45 minutes on the phone with DoorDash.
1140,Anytime I've used their service after has been by accident (not realizing that's who the restaurant uses for delivery) and every time I'm frustrated and get my food an hour later.
1140,It's a joke.
1145,I order Doordash pretty regularly due to the nature of my job and most of the time it is fine and the food gets here on time and everything.
1145,Here lately I have multiple orders in a row where my Dasher either never makes it to the store or they go somewhere way out of the way.
1145,The last two orders I have placed both had to be canceled.
1145,"One was for the Dollar General two miles down the road from where I was working and the Dasher parked across the street from the store for over an hour, at least that's what I could see on the map."
1145,"Ultimately he never went inside and the store closed and I had to talk to customer service for a refund because the app refused to refund me due to the ""order already being started."""
1145,Then tonight I ordered from one of my favorite restaurants and the driver drove almost to the next town over and didn't move for more than 30 minutes before finally I get a call saying there was an emergency and my order was canceled.
1145,Gotta say I'm pretty angry about it.
1166,I ordered food for my family at Disney World.
1166,I was given a time quote and the driver messaged me when he arrived at the restaurant.
1166,He said the restaurant was telling him he would have to be waiting much longer past the quoted arrival time.
1166,I apologized as this was just his time wasted.
1166,As my order continued to push out I tried to reach out to customer service to see what my options were.
1166,I couldn't get anyone.
1166,I had to order other food for my family.
1166,I was able to get them fed and in bed before I got a response from an agent.
1166,"My option was to cancel my still in progress order and the driver would not get paid, or continue to wait for a $10 credit."
1166,I choose not to screw over the driver and I received an order of food for a family hours after I was quoted.
1166,Said family was asleep in bed and I could only save what I could pack into a mini fridge.
1166,"Oh yeah, and the agent ended our chat once I said I would not cancel and screw the driver."
1166,So I never got my $10 credit.
1166,Never again DoorDash!
1166,Deleting app now!
1194,Don't expect a guarantee you will get your food or your money back.
1194,If you are lucky you will get half your money after a lot of effort and no lunch.
1194,It's a gamble every time.
1194,Convenient yeah - if you don't get screwed that trip.
1194,So many people I work with have gotten screwed multiple times too.
1194,"Bad dashers, stolen money, stolen orders, incomplete orders, part of order never delivered and when you are told you will get your money back they do not tell you it's only half and if you trust and not check your bank they say too much time has gone passed to change your case."
1194,Customer service is non-existent and in a foreign country.
1194,"They just repeat themselves and pretend a review panel examines your case (it takes moments so yeah, no) but the company takes no accountability for your money or order."
1194,Forget about asking to talk to someone higher up or get an address to write to.
1194,"Since this business hurts restaurants anyway, I encourage everyone to avoid using it."
1201,I did a total of 4 orders on DoorDash in one day.
1201,3 orders were delivered successfully but my last order showed delivered but it wasn't.
1201,The dasher took a picture of her car dashboard.
1201,I contacted customer service and I thought the issue was resolved when I said I just want another order place.
1201,"I see where the order was placed, but Zaxby's told the new dasher Steven that two orders was already made and gone mind you I ordered from Zaxby's twice and the second one I never received."
1201,I contacted customer service again and was told they would give me $25 credit for the inconvenience but I would still receive the food.
1201,The dasher then called me and say I have to cancel my order so to make a long story short DoorDash only gave me $4 because even though the order was canceled due to their error they couldn't give me my money back.
1201,I spend plenty of money with DoorDash look me up by my name but I promise I will not give another penny to this garbage company.
1230,Absolute ridiculous joke of a company.
1230,I'm going to tell everyone I know to never to use this shame.
1230,I order my first order as a gift to my family on vacation in florida which was all booze.
1230,I had to upload an ID and sign off on verification of age when deliver was made.
1230,Driver took a picture of their dash and said it was delivered and took off.
1230,I escalated this to the first round of customer service and was told I had a valid case and they would escalate it further.
1230,Next morning I received a notice from their customer service that I had never ordered before and therefore didn't qualify for a refund.
1230,Escalated again and was told basically too bad.
1230,DON'T EVER USE THIS CLOWN OF A SITE!!
1230,I will tell everyone and anyone I talk to the same thing!
1230,"First order ever I make with them gets stolen and their response is ""too bad you have never ordered with us so we can't help you""."
1230,Absolutely joke!
1238,I hen I tell you the fact that ANYONE can work for this company and they don't care about the way the treat you… I MEAN IT!!!
1238,I had a delivery driver who called cussing me out because they had to park ACROSS THE STREET instead of out front.
1238,"Then when I opened the door and they were walking away, in front of my toddler they started CUSSING ME OUT!"
1238,It was f you mf!
1238,"And a bunch of other stuff, my baby was scared and started crying then my husband came out and all of a sudden this make delivery driver changed his tone."
1238,He got really nervous and afraid and tried to play victim.
1238,When I called customer service to report the incident they said the best they could do was refund me the $3 delivery fee.
1238,I miss the days when customer service mattered.
1238,"I don't expect people to take being treated like less than from anyone, but that should also mean you can't treat customers like this with no repercussions."
1250,In January 2022 I placed an order with DoorDash at IHOP.
1250,I was told the order was picked up but I never received the order.
1250,I received a refund from DoorDash.
1250,"Saturday, November 12, 2022 I decided to give DoorDash another try."
1250,I ordered from ihop with DoorDash again.
1250,The apt said my food was on the way.
1250,The driver was Patrice and I watched the apt of her entering my subdivision.
1250,I then looked at my surveillance cameras and observed a gold color car stopped in front of my house.
1250,I then received a notice that my food was delivered and a photo of the food in a bag.
1250,It look like it was in her vehicle when she took the photo.
1250,She never exited the car and drove off without me receiving the food.
1250,I called DoorDash and the said I will not receive a refund because I had a duplicate in January.
1250,So I received no food and out of my money.
1250,I will never use DoorDash again.
1250,Bad customer service.
1250,Deleted the apt.
1295,After waiting two hours for my order I called support to get assistance and told them that my order had first and canceled for no reason and that when I called the restaurant to come pick it up myself they informed me that they had assigned a new driver to my new order.
1295,my driver was not the issue it was the app canceling the order without a reason and when I informed customer service of this they informed me that they can offer me a five dollar credit for my $43 order that is now pending on my account two different times because I had to redo the order.
1295,"so two hour wait for an order that was supposed to arrive within 30 minutes and almost $90 taken out of my account until the first refund goes through, and they offer me five dollars…"
1317,"I paid the extra fee for express delivery because we were ordering sushi and it says ""straight to you"" which, for sushi, I really think is important so it doesn't sit in a car for other deliveries."
1317,"However, on the map, I watched the dasher make at least 2 other deliveries fiest."
1317,"When I contacted customer service, they said they group deliveries by location."
1317,"I asked what the point of ""straight to you"" is and they basically wouldn't answer the question even after I said please just answer my question."
1317,I didn't want a refund….
1317,"I wanted to know if it was really supposed to be ""straight to you"" so I knew whether to ever do it again…."
1317,And they could NOT give me an answer.
1327,DoorDash does not give your money back after one mess up of you reporting it.
1327,I have had to deal with my order messed up miserably and not get my money back?
1327,"And I had to deal with this TWICE, first some of my food was missing."
1327,"Second, they got my order messed up and put black olives NOTE: I can allergic to black olives."
1327,I sent a report for both of these issues before and neither got dealt with and they said they couldn't do a thing about it.
1327,"I have not received my money back what so ever and I thought maybe I'll try DoorDash again and they fixed their poor communication and annoying policy, WRONG."
1327,Do not order or get this app if you intend on getting scammed out your money and poor customer service.
1337,I made an order for breakfast over 30 minutes before the menu would change.
1337,Got confirmation right away from the restaurant.
1337,It took another 20 minutes to be notified that they didn't have a dasher in the area.
1337,Probably something you should have before you allow someone to put in the order.
1337,Another 40 minutes go by and I get informed that they can't process my order at all because breakfast time was over.
1337,All I got from the customer service was that my order was cancelled.
1337,There needs to be some other reimbursement than just giving the payment back and there needs to be some way for you to ensure there's a dasher before someone can put in an order.
268,I had a promo sub to Grubhub+ and decided to cancel early to not get charged.
268,All cancellation verbiage said I would continue to have benefits until the end of the billing but they removed it.
268,Service reps said it didn't matter what the messaging said and there wasn't anything they could do.
268,I wouldn't have canceled early if the messaging let me know I wouldn't have the benefits after I canceled.
268,Glad I deleted my account and app.
1111,Every discount offer I look at has a minimum dollar amount that is for several people.
1111,A single person wouldn't be ordering enough food to meet the minimum.
1111,What gives?
867,Place an order any time late and night and watch as the app tries and fails to find you a driver.
867,"I would have loved for this app to work but unless you like being disappointed, stay away."
867,Ive had like 3 orders that have been canceled because the app couldn't find a driver and they make you wait hours until its canceled to give you your money back.
867,I guess thats what happens when you treat your workers like garbage 🤷‍♂️.
867,"Avoid these resturaunt delivery apps at all cost, they are hella not worth the ""convenience"" they promise."
537,This app likes to waste people's time.
537,Your order WILL take longer than they say almost guaranteed and on top of that they give you 3 different times.
537,They will tell you 25 to 30 minutes when you are ordering and then give you an estimated arrival time 35 minutes from now.
537,"Then you will get a ""latest arrival"" time for an hour after you ordered."
537,They say any order that arrives before this time is technically on time meaning as long as you get your order within a whole hour that's fine with them.
537,Idk about you but I dont like hour old food.
537,But guess what happens when your order doesn't make it within the hour.
537,"You would think a refund or some type of compensation but nope, they just push your latest arrival time back as if the last latest arrival time wasn't supposed to be THE LATEST TIME YOUR FOOD WILL ARRIVE."
537,Of course this comes complete with a notification letting you know the obvious that your stomach was probably telling you for an hour and a bogus apology.
537,With all the time wasted on this app you'd be better off cooking.
302,Great app… Intuitive easy interface makes ordering and checking out painless.
302,Only negative is the Grubhub + ….
302,I don't see the value in it… had it for a few months..ehhh
1286,I've been using Doordash for a few months and it's been great.
1286,This is the first time something bad had happened and it's made me nervous that stuff like this can happen more often so I'm taking a break from this app for now.
1286,A person named Amy was supposed to give me my food that I payed $21 for and she ended up taking it.
1286,"She never moved from her spot on the map, wouldn't answer my texts, and when I tried to call her it said that her phone is not in service anymore."
1286,There was nothing else I can do besides canceling it after waiting an hour and getting $20 worth of credits for a next order on the app.
1300,"As a longtime DoorDash user, it's absolutely appalling for the company to constantly raise rates on delivery service by introducing things such as Instant delivery."
1300,This capitalistic mindset from the business is creating an unstable experience for customers Who wants to use the service at an affordable price.
1300,Most people who use the regular service are paying up to $10+ in fees and tips which was not the case a few months ago.
1300,"While using the ""new standard service"", my food is arriving much later and colder than usually."
1300,"As a consumer, it's starting to be apparent that I'm better off buying my items at the location instead of using DoorDash."
1300,Or just use a different service all together.
478,Not a lot of menu choices.
478,Does not offer a lot of normal menu options that are on multiple restaurants menus and are available for delivery with other delivery services
687,"Would be a four, but prices are getting out of control in general."
687,"Largest issue is that the app will not default to your nearest location, even when ordering from the same franchise."
687,"Multiple times I've had to cancel, or wait longer than I should because it auto picks a location 8 miles away, when the same eateries are located less than a mile away."
687,"Lastly, menu options do not reflect what is actually available from a location, and alterations are not sometimes possible on the app, when it would not be an issue in person."
1003,"VirtuallyEvery restaurant I go to in the app… It allows me to choose items… And when I go to my cart I get a message that says ""sorry your menu options have changed while ordering"" or something like that… But regardless I'm not able to complete the order."
1003,"Literally six different restaurants, almost all of which I've ordered from previously, showed me this message… And it's been happening for several weeks?"
490,Great order that I got from Applebee's.
490,I'm ordering the same thing again today it was great thank you
652,Ordered food an hour prior before getting refunded $30 that's going to hit my account in 3-5 days.
652,The whole hour I had drivers constantly going to pick up and dropping my order every 15 minutes.
652,"It's heavily snowing and after 45 minutes of trying to get a driver we instead got a dude on a bike to go get my order in 16 degree snowy weather at night, all for the same dude to drop my order 20 minutes later."
652,2 other guys did the same thing but they were in cars.
652,I just wanted to go get something else at that point and do it myself but ofc I couldn't because you have to wait 30 minutes to get it canceled and the timer resets after people decide they want to go get it.
652,This loop has really agitated me and I think I'll be my own driver from now on…
815,The app closes down while processing an order at least twice - this never used to be the case but lately I noticed how it crashes once you place an order and again when the app begins to process the order.
815,"This doesn't happen on any other food delivery app - I use Uber as I get Uber credit every month but without that, I would place an order elsewhere as it's quite annoying when the app crashes and gives you a black screen for 5 seconds each time"
1341,The double dash (adding on to an order from an additional vendor) NEVER works.
1341,.Also I have entered my ID into the app and verified that is correct multiple times.
1341,Still every single alcohol order ends up taking the delivery person ages to enter and half the time the app crashes on them halfway through and they have to start over.
1341,.So basically I end up paying twice the delivery fees and watch a complete stranger take every bit of information from my ID which is already loaded into the app every time an order involves alcohol.
1341,".To add to the frustration, the two times I reported mistakes in my order, not a single thing was done to correct or refund."
37,So I order from a place 5 minutes away.
37,The driver is positioned 10 minutes away from me.
37,5 minutes from the restaurant.
37,I called to confirm the food was ready for pick up 20 min after ordering.
37,The driver proceeds to just drive around for whatever reason for 40 min.
37,Literally went back and forth to the street the restaurant was on 3 times and never once grabbed my food.
37,Now finally after an hour or so I receive my food and it's cold.
37,So I ask for not even a full refund but atleast half my money back cause I'm not eating a cold sandwich that should of just came off a press.
37,Then you have the nerve to say you can only give me 5$ credit back!?
37,"Then the agent ""helping"" me proceeds to say he is gonna transfer me to another department and ends the communication and hangs up on me."
37,I hope your company gets shut down.
37,Terrible service.
933,I recently ordered from rib shack barbecue in Union.
933,The food was wasn't to my liking.
933,I had two orders of mac and cheese missing from my order.
933,You guys refunded me five dollars the two mac and cheese that  was $3.95 each I think and $5 that is efficient and I am not happy with that.
933,I would like my full refund back.
933,I'm always satisfied when I order from you guys or at the restaurant I choose from the site this one I refuse to pay for it.
933,It was disgusting and my order was missing.
933,And I am very unhappy with the outcome of everything.
970,"I've had multiple failed deliveries, did not receive my food and tipped well..I'm able to get a full refund for everything but cannot take back the tip the delivery driver does not deserve as they failed to even be a delivery service as I received zero of my order."
970,.Very disappointing when this happens!
970,.I love Ubereats but I need an option to change my tip like they use to have.
970,I tip well to encourage and help delivery drivers and for good service but if I do it beforehand cannot alter it even if they fail to deliver..I always tip beforehand because or else drivers would take up to 30 minutes to an hour to get here and the food would be cold..Delivery service is suppose to deliver and when that service fails it's very disappointing!
1344,If I could just load the pictures of how horrible my order arrived I would.
1344,The driver had my order in her car for 30-40 minutes prior.
1344,"We had a hot sub, two hotdogs and two milkshakes."
1344,"The hot food was absolutely cold and fell apart, soggy bread, etc."
1344,our milkshakes were so warm that it melted the whipped topping and definitely wasn't a milkshake anymore.
1344,DoorDash is refusing to refund even after sending them pictures of my order.
1344,After several attempts I finally reported them to the BBB.
1344,I am also going to dispute the charges with my bank.
1344,As per law if a customer does not receive the product as it should be.
1344,A full refund will be issued.
1344,I will fight this until I get my money back.
1344,I have everything I need to win this.
639,Use competitors for grocery or food delivery because about 50% of the time I've ordered my order disappears and driver disappears OR it's a crazy long wait.
639,25% of the time my order is incorrect or subpar food handling.
639,"In the last 12 months, 100% customer support has been completely unhelpful."
639,"There's been a few times I've had to contact my back to get reimbursed for a driver disappearing, never getting my order but being charged."
639,"..Uber Legal team, if your delivery drivers are disappearing on you with miscellaneous groceries or food, you need to find a better way to press civil and criminal charges on the drivers for theft and fraud."
639,This is in major city in Texas for context.
639,"Haven't had these same issues, besides increased wait times, with other delivery services."
879,I proceeded with the order to make my point .
879,I tried ordering a sandwich @.
879,McDonald's and and the process continue saying the Menu changed while you were browsing.
879,If something is not available ensure that's indicating on the menu .
879,Don't wait until check out then indicate menu changed .
879,That's the most frustrating experience that's why order I was able to  order.
879,Someone Should review the process and correct it
323,I enjoy Grubhub because of the convenience of how quickly you can order.
323,Sometimes they have good deals to shave off all those extra fees.
323,But sometimes their fees are over the top.
744,Discounts usually don't mean much since fees eat up the discount… gas is no longer crazy high so why are we stuck paying these extra fees… they don't go to the drivers and the fees are higher when I order more food so it makes me want to order less… it doesn't cost a driver more to bring me a bag with 5 items than it does a bag with 4 items but you charge more because I purchased more food… you're hurting consumers drivers and restaurants… please stop being greedy
1052,"Postmates used to be my favorite delivery app, but I recently learned that each menu item is priced higher then it would be at the restaurant."
1052,Why do they need to do that when they already charge so much an extra fees!
1052,"I feel completely scammed, and it explains why they give away promos so often."
1052,"Even with the promo, it's more expensive to order it on the app and it would be to get it delivered from the actual restaurant which I just learned so I will be doing that from now on."
1285,"The app is pretty good, great even at times, but it's getting ridiculous with the delivery fees."
1285,Before it was just $5 for the extra fees on your meal but now it can range anywhere from $10 to $15 bucks with every order.
1285,"The delivery drivers are great but if you at least want to give them a tip of $5, it's nearly $15 to $20 on top of your order that's already expensive depending on how much you're ordering and I usually go for the cheap stuff..Imagine ordering from McDonald's for a $6 meal and end up spending $20 to $25 bucks just for one person."
1285,It can definitely be pricy if you're trying to budget and have no car to do pickups.
1285,The app is great but it definitely needs work
521,"I was charged a ""cancellation fee"" worth 2/3 of the order because the App didn't update my location when I changed states and I had to cancel an order immediately after making it (less than 15 seconds) because it was going to the wrong state."
521,"First ""agent"" gave me vague excuses about technical difficulties and ended the chat."
521,Second agent assured me that the entire charge was a temporary hold.
521,"Contacted third agent because I was still charged and they told me, contrary to the second agent, that I was charged because the restaurant had already started the order."
521,At the very least Uber needs to address the inconsistency.
521,"Moreover, if their system is truly so sensitive that an order can be irrevocably locked in as soon as the order is submitted, they either need better safeguards in the app or better integrated systems with the restaurants to prevent a trivial mistake like forgetting to change an address at checkout from costing the entire cost of the food."
521,"I understand paying for the cost of the user's mistake to the company, but the one I was charged was outlandish relative to the mistake."
894,I feel like I should get a refund.
894,"I came into the car and the man had asked me for my age, and when i told him I was under 18 he immediately refused to drive me."
894,"He told me ""I can't drive you get out."""
894,I'm assuming he was some sort of sex offender and wasn't allowed to be around children under the age of 18.
894,You guys need to do more background checks.
894,I had to ask a coworker to give me a ride after crying and standing there in the cold without a clue what to do next.
894,Then I was charged an almost 8 dollar cancellation fee because THE DRIVER refused to drive me.
894,Nope.
894,Never again.
393,"They can charge additional funds (even several days after the order) beyond what's agreed on when checking out, and they won't even notify you."
393,Remember to check your bank statements!
393,"They claim this is the adjustment for mismatch pricing, but they are the ones who put the wrong price on the menu in the first place."
1069,Done using delivery services.
1069,I am not because of you but because the restaurants that i order from simply can never get the orders right.
1069,So i am paying you to deliver wrong orders.
1069,I would be concerned from your point of view because i am not alone.
1069,I see forums and social media turning on this as well.
1069,High prices already and then paying you to deliver wrong food.
1069,"Yikes, i would be concerned about your restaurants"
269,Fees even when paying for plus.
269,Their drivers are horrible and they don't allow us to rate them separately from the restaurant.
269,"Their Grubhub guarantee is a joke as my order was late and I was never given a credit, it says it will be issued in 24 hours and that was 2 weeks ago."
269,Not the first time they've completely ignored the guarantee based on late delivery.
106,Deliveries frequently show up long after the estimated delivery time.
106,This usually means an hour or longer after the order was placed.
106,"Delivery drivers lie about pick up time, which is ridiculous because their location is displayed on the app."
106,"Drivers frequently refuse to get out of their cars to drop off food, expecting customers to come to them."
106,Why do we even tip for such poor service?
106,Why can't we tip after the food has been delivered?
106,The delivery fees just keep getting higher too.
182,There are a few places that I will avoid because I know it's going to take forever to get the delivery when promised.
182,"When that does happen, however, Grubhub is good about compensating you with one click once your estimated delivery time window has come but your food hasn't."
895,My order was cancelled with no explanation after 90 minutes of appearing to be in progress.
895,Estimated delivery time was 30 minutes at the time of the order.
895,I understand that things can happen but I appreciate an explanation.
895,"Without it, I can't trust that my next order will show up."
895,"..Also it's always cheaper to order delivery through the restaurant itself, even if they have a delivery fee."
895,Good prices are increased AND there is a delivery fee AND there is a service fee.
895,All these fees and there's no guarantee you'll get your order.
951,Honestly I like sticking to doordash cause it won't have stuff like ubereats does.
951,They will randomly cancel my order after waiting 20 minutes with no reasoning and there will be times that I'll accidentally order and try to cancel but they basically charge the whole fee.
951,Already cancelled my ubereats premium subscription just not worth it when they can just constantly change the estimated delivery time instead of being late
753,My order was cancelled by support because I was frustrated with them for not helping me apply a coupon that was offered to me...They told me I can't refund an order I already placed.
753,I told them I wanted to apply a coupon to an order I did not place yet.
753,"..They told me, again, I can't refund an order I already placed."
753,"I told them, again, I did not place any orders...This repeated 3 times."
753,I told them I felt like I wasn't being heard and that they were doing their job poorly.
753,I had my chat closed on me and all further conversations ignored...I gave up on the coupon and took the $25 service fee hit and ordered anyways.
753,"Then the same support member, Anamika, manually cancelled my order and I got a notification about it."
753,"So I called customer support and relayed this story and they confirmed everything with my account history...So they gave me $10 in credits and refunded my cancelled order, then I made the order again...I hope the staff they hire for chat gets completely fired."
753,"Horrible, horrible, lazy people."
1246,I rarely post reviews but felt like I shouldn't let these issues sit as they could impact others not paying attention.
1246,We will be deleting this app after tonight's experience.
1246,..1.
1246,Doordash provided me a promo to entice me to place an order.
1246,At checkout they declined to honor that promo.
1246,There were no explanations.
1246,.2.
1246,"Doordash advertised no delivery fee initially for the restaurant I was ordering from, however, at checkout it somehow added a deliver fee."
1246,Was that a bug?
1246,I'm not sure.
1246,But given the other issues my guess is it's a feature and they're advertising of fee is wonky at best.
1246,.3.
1246,"Even if there was no ""delivery"" fee there was a 15% ""service fee"" which is not for the dasher."
1246,they mix that additional fee into the taxes section of the bill.
1246,"Let's face it Doordash, that's a delivery fee through the eyes of the consumer trying to figure out how much it will cost to order delivery."
1246,.4.
1246,They promote a monthly pass and that you can sign up for a trial to fees waived.
1246,"However, when I went to sign up for that the app again had another ""error"" and wouldn't apply."
1246,"..All in all, my order would have been 25-30% more expensive than just picking up."
1246,For some that may be worth it.
1246,"But even for those that it is, I'm sure they'd like transparency."
121,If I could give a 0 star I would.
121,I live in california and got scammed for 5 seperate orders in Arkansas to 5 different locations.
121,I contacted them the day of its now 3 weeks later after 10+ conversations I still haven't been emailed back.
121,"They respond "" we will advance this to a specialist and they'll reach out in 24-48 hours."
121,It's about to be 24 days later and no message my orders totaling over 300 dollars still has not been refunded even after this long.
121,I'm annoyed and they give the same message about the advancing to a specialist.
121,Terrible support
845,I was trying to get two food items from a nearby restaurant and it said that it would take 30-40 mins.
845,Then it postponed to 10 mins later then 20 then an hour and a half passed.
845,I was leaving that spot so I reordered it to go to a different location.
845,It said it would take another 30 mins.
845,I accepted and it got postponed another 10 mins to 40 mins.
845,The ironic part was that by the time I left the spot they finally sent a driver.
845,"I ordered this Food item at 2:30pm, and a driver was finally sent at around 6:30pm."
845,DoorDash just takes 20 mins and gets You right.
1094,I ordered from a local franchise and a half hour my order was canceled .
1094,I don't know why.
1094,"I placed the same order at a different location of the franchise, and close to a half hour later it was canceled too!"
1094,"I just placed the same order at a different location, same franchise."
1094,Waiting to see if it works.
219,"It's bad enough the amount of fees they tack on to every order, but most of the menu prices are dollars more than what the restaurant charges."
219,"What would have been an $18 order from a restaurant jumped up to $35 before tip solely from fees, taxes, and GH charging $3 more per item from that restaurant."
219,..Never again.
219,"I've had my account since they came to Chicago, but I will not use them anymore at all."
219,Nearly $20 surcharge is ridiculous.
692,I love using the app and ability to order from many restaurants but when there is a problem with an order it's difficult that you can't speak to someone.
692,Sometimes it's resolved properly and others it's not.
692,"Also when you pay for priority delivery or even just regular delivery and the time increases 15+ minutes from the latest time originally stated it's not fair to have to pay for priority still and not being able to do anything about it being so much later than originally stated, which happens often"
397,"Grub-hub has been a great blessing to me, I'm paralyzed,and get tired of the microwave ding as my dinner bell!!"
397,I've been lucky in that the drivers have been very kind and accommodating!
397,True Blessing!
397,Thank you!
397,!
1226,I have had regular problems with DoorDash.
1226,"Items missing, brought to wrong door, yesterday it was spilled coffee all over bag and about 2/3 of drink left."
1226,Then there's the times when I order at seven and they have so few drivers I'm still waiting at ten and several times I ordered and waited until the store closed and the order got canceled.
1226,"Other times if I remember to order before seven, I got it okay and everting was good."
1226,It is convenient to use them because I am wheelchair bound and can't drive .
1226,It gets frustrating not getting what you ordered but you just have to take the bad with the good.
1226,They don't have much control over how good their drivers are.
1226,They do the best they can by refunding your money.
1226,It would just be nice to always get what you ordered in good condition.
862,Get ready to have messed up food and the app tell you it's not eligible for a refund!
862,The restaurant will tell you to contact Uber and the app offers no help.
862,"More than once I've had food stolen, messed up, received the wrong order and had food missing with absolutely no resolve for the issues."
862,It's more headaches than convenience.
862,Don't waste time or money on this company Bc all they want is the money and don't care if you're able to eat the food when it comes or not and don't care if it doesn't show up.
467,They need to get better drivers.
467,The amount of times I've had to request a refund because a driver forgot an item or dropped the food at the wrong location is insane.
467,There's never any proof either that they dropped it off at the right location.
467,Ubereats is better
255,They are adding money to you orders after you have already paid.
255,They are trying to claim that it is because of price discrepancies at the restaurant but it's not.
255,It is because this company is not updating prices on their app like they are suppose to do so stuff like this does not happen.
255,I will be talking to all my restaurant owner friends to take grubhub off of their delivery options for over charging costumers.
634,You're better off going into the store.
634,Everything is 2-3 times more expensive ordering from them.
634,This doesn't even include tip because they don't give their drivers a bonus or tip.
634,So on top of our triple price we have to top the drivers.
634,Then I tried to delete the app and of course they made it nearly impossible to delete my account.
634,"I had to do extensive research on google and if you're wondering, you have to click on privacy, the delete button used to be on that page but of course they deleted it and now once there you have to click on Help or something then it takes you to the actual website where you have to scroll down and find the delete button and go through a 30 day waiting trial period before you account actually gets deleted"
238,Menu items are so marked up that I only use it when I have to since I'm disabled.
238,Why not make items the same price as you would if picking up (OR A LITTLE ABOVE since the restaurant does have to do a LITTLE extra for GrubHub deliveries) and still collect your normal fees?
70,I cannot tell you how many times my order never gets delivered but marked delivered.
70,Drivers don't even attempt to contact you even though I have clear directions to do so in my order.
70,"They just keep the food, mark it delivered and drive off."
70,"Unlike other delivery apps, they're not required to take a picture of proof of delivery."
70,I will say at least customer support reorders it for me or gives a refund but I'm ordering food when I'm in a rush with limited time and I don't have time to wait another hour for the re-order.
70,Plus you tip the driver beforehand so these drivers get away with my money and my food.
70,Trust me the way this company operates their business is not worth your time.
147,All of the reviews are bad…also Grubhub charges the most compared to other delivery apps.
147,I almost paid 54 dollars for a personal size pizza from Pizza Hut and cinnamon rolls.
147,"There is a couple of stores on here that aren't real… like it's a scam, when you look up the address nothing would be there or it would be a abandoned house."
147,They take your money but a driver is never assigned and just says you order is in progress.
147,they will give you a refund if this was to happen but i feel like it shouldn't happen at all.
158,"They don't allow you to rate drivers on this app and I'm noticing that every time I order using this app the drivers never follow the drop off instructions, instead call and complain about having to get out of the car."
158,"I'm sure if they did allow users to rate drivers, the ratings would all be 1 star."
158,"So far, the worst experience of all the food delivery apps I've used."
362,"Seriously, I was fine waiting, but after 30 minutes my order was just cancelled."
362,No explanation.
362,"Between this and other food delivery apps, it's always cold, always late, never reliable."
362,It's most likely the drivers biting off more than they can chew.
483,"""Service Fees"" are much higher than other delivery apps."
483,"Also, there are less dining/location options available."
494,It's a little cheaper than other food delivery apps.
494,Not many issues with app or workers.
494,Great service!!
494,!
675,The coupons aren't really worth it.
675,"I get it, everyone has to make money somehow, but don't give coupons if they aren't going to actually do anything."
675,"Like not all of the coupons are bad, but you guys do things like say ""$15 off of you spend $40 or more"" then , after putting $42 worth of stuff in my cart , you take off $15 just to put it back in taxes fee and delivery charges, bringing it back to $41."
675,Pointless.
675,"Or you'll do ""up to 25% off $30+ orders"" and then take off $8, then put it back in taxes fees and deliver charges!"
675,"At that point, why even give the discount?"
143,Honestly I have nothing against Grubhub.
143,When we lived in NYC it was the undisputed best app to order food from and it was overall what you'd expect.
143,Reasonable and reliable.
143,However since our move to LA they really seem to have lost this.
143,"The orders are often wrong, take a very long time, and the customer support is not very supportive or helpful with this."
143,"I strongly believe that Grubhub just isn't a good option for LA residents, and that ordering restaurant direct or DoorDash are far superior options."
776,Uber not only lets people that can't follow a gps deliver for them but they also have the worst customer support system I've ever seen.
776,My order never showed up after an hour of trying to get in touch with my delivery driver.
776,The app wouldn't let me cancel and then when I try to report my issue it takes another 30 minutes to get through to someone and then ends the chat on me.
776,So I never got my order or a refund.
776,This happened to me years ago as well and this was only the 4th time using the app since then.
776,Just know if your order never comes don't expect a refund
1130,I am a college kid who also works full time the majority of my time I'm constantly busy weather it be with classes or work I don't get a lot of time to stop and enjoy things.
1130,"So, that's what I really enjoy  doordash I can put in an order real quick and I can have warm food for when I'm too busy to really stop and take a moment to cook or go get something myself."
1130,Lately tho it just hasn't been pulling through I get you guys get busy at certain times but lately there's been a lot of problems a lot of the time it's a struggle to even get a dasher or when I do get assigned a dasher the communication between the company and the dasher is so poor that my food was almost delivered across town.
1130,I really enjoy the services normally so it's sad to see if not live up.
1130,It's crazy how much more expensive it is to order through DoorDash and the customer support is literally the worst customer support I've ever seen ninety percent of the time they don't actually do anything to really help you I had to wait an hour and a half just to get McDonald's.
1130,If I had the extra time to make my own food at home or go out then I would more then gladly but it's not always that easy.
1130,This company has honestly taken such a bad turn from what it started out as.
1141,the dashers messed up repeatedly.
1141,"i mean, almost every order."
1141,once i got the completely wrong order.
1141,"most other times, they missed a drink or some food item."
1141,here's the thing.
1141,it's fine if the item is missing or the completely wrong order IF i get compensated.
1141,"i had been getting compensated up to this point, rightfully so, but today, the dasher marked the order as delivered when i literally never got the food."
1141,"in fact, the dasher was in the downtown of the city when he marked the order delivered, when i live in the suburbs."
1141,i didn't get compensated for this.
1141,"doordash's reason was that i was compensated ""in the previous orders""."
1141,"i understand that doordash may think i'm scamming for credit, but most of the times, there wasn't even an option to submit photos or videos to prove that what i'm saying was the truth."
1141,"so currently, i'm sitting here, with no credit for the food that i paid for but didn't get, no food (the dasher either ate it or delivered it to some random person), and the restaurants near me are closed because the dasher had already taken an hour to pick up the food."
1141,"at least compensate me, but no because doordash's customer support is extremely closed minded, unsupportive, and very rigid."
1141,extremely furious.
1143,"I've used this for around a year now, no problem."
1143,"Until the other day when I ordered over $50 worth of food from IHOP (please note this was done through their website and not DoorDash, but the delivery was done by a DoorDash driver)."
1143,I received a text saying the driver was approaching with my order but she was not here and it was never delivered.
1143,"I context customer support, and for as much sweet talking they do, they did not help me."
1143,"I was transferred to another agent seven times, which caused them to completely misunderstand my issue."
1143,"I was told I only spent $30 and would only be refunded that, and I showed them the email with proof that I paid $50."
1143,"I was ignored, and I received an email saying my order from the DAY BEFORE, from WALGREENS, was refunded."
1143,"The second I said ""wait, that not the right order"", I was dropped by the chat and had to do it all over again."
1143,"I did eventually get an agent who actually listened to me and helped me get my refund, but I don't know if the driver ever faced consequences."
1143,"I was already struggling enough with money, now I'm down another $50 until my refund comes in and I had to go to work with no food."
1143,I don't like writing reviews but this feels very deserved.
1175,"While the app itself is ""functional"", the user interface was designed by an idiot."
1175,..No way to clear cart without manually deleting each item.
1175,"Even force closing the app and logging out won't do it..No way to leave support chat screen with the chat still open..""Need help with current order"" just defaults to selecting a past order..App repeatedly asks and fails to verify my card...Now for my experience with customer support."
1175,"..During my first attempt I was connected to someone Named Deepak, who clearly wasn't paying attention to my problem, as his first 3 suggestions were all negated by my initial description of the problem."
1175,"..After accidentally leaving the chat with no way to return due to the aforementioned design flaws made by an idiot,..I attempted a second chat with customer support with someone named Megha."
1175,"I assume Meghan didn't fit, but then again Deepak fits, so who knows."
1175,"..Regardless they clearly weren't paying attention either, because their first suggestion was that I ""try using the app instead of the desktop site"" even though I clearly just said that my problem was in the app, and that the app ""will only ask to scan the card for verification"" when I specifically said that was the part that doesn't work."
1175,"And then they gave up and sent me a ""troubleshooting email"" so I can fix their poorly designed, apparently buggy software myself."
1175,..I am DEEPLY unimpressed.
1271,Just disappointed I was not reimbursed for when my Thai food order of triple vegetable with beef was not reimbursed like customer support said they would.
1271,We had a three way conversation with the driver myself and customer support who heard the driver say he never did pick up my Thai food order.
1271,Customer support said wait 25 minutes and you should see the refund.
1271,I thought it was safe to reorder and thought I'd get a fresh remake of what I ordered.
1271,Two hours later when I reordered I got delivered my original order and never reimbursed.
1271,I got charged twice for 2 hour old food.
1328,Unfortunately I won't be using this service anymore.
1328,It was convenient but the risk of paying for a service that is not provided is not ok.
1328,I ordered a meal and the driver dropped it at an address that doesn't exist yet put it on a porch of a house.
1328,Sent me the picture and I had to go looking for it.
1328,Never found it.
1328,I contacted customer support to simply ask for a refund or a reorder and they denied me both.
1328,Told me I would be getting a refund and a confirmation would be sent in 24 hours.
1328,After 48 nothing.
1328,I reached out about my refund to which I was told due to THEIR policy they do not refund orders not received.
1328,I don't feel this is right and I won't be using them anymore and I caution others of this policy.
424,"I have never in my entire life left a review on an app, but I just have to express my disappointment."
424,On two different occasions my food was dropped off at the wrong house.
424,My house is not difficult to find and the instructions are as clear as day.
424,I understand that no one is to blame but that doesn't lessen my frustration!
1259,I can't leave a poor review for my driver after I filled a complaint?
1259,"I waited 45 min for a pop I ordered, it was sent to the completely wrong house."
1259,It wasn't a complicated address.
1259,I even gave directions in the description in case they struggled.
1259,"Yet, my dasher now gets my tip and no poor review."
1259,Gets out scotch free.
1259,All I get is a REDUND so I can order it again and try again.
1259,"No coupons, no discount, just a chance to give them their money back all over again."
1259,"So now, 80+min for my order as I try again."
1259,"This is why I've never used DoorDash and lesson learned, I'll never use it again after today...Not to mention, the pop was for kids… by the time they get here they'll get put in the fridge for tomorrow because it'll be their bedtime."
1259,So now I have to deal with disappointed kids.
1259,Thanks.
453,"So I can favorite restaurants, but why the eff can't we also favorite items on their menu?!"
453,It would make ordering our favorite items extremely easier.
479,I find some of my new favorite restaurants in my area on GrubHub weekly!!!
479,My food is always on time and in great shape like I was picking it up myself.
693,"The app is pretty cool, I've always had good experiences with delivery , but: 1."
693,Prices are often higher now for each item (thus used to distinguish Uber esta from DoorDash in usa).
693,2.
693,"Moreover there are additional charges for Uber, such that even paying for the premium you are not breaking even before tip."
693,3.
693,"If you go to a new place, it doesn't realize that you are traveling."
693,This can lead to some confusion while you look for restaurants that you know should be there (maybe even cause you to order from the wrong restaurant I imagine)
71,The app is great and makes it easy to order food online from the best restaurants in town.
71,It's also a great place to find new restaurants and try different things.
71,I order delivery and pickup all the time and my order has been correct every time but once and Grubhub gave a refund with no hassle.
71,Sign up for Grubhub plus!
71,It is worth every penny!
71,It pays for itself after three deliveries plus you get a lot of awesome discounts and freebies from the restaurants and Grubhub!
836,So I never order delivery but i just got COVID so I'm like let me use the free meal.
836,I pick my meal do the normal process hit check out (all the while waiting to see the discount hit) and I pay the full price.
836,"So I'm like scammy layout, fine fool me once I'll do my due diligence the next time I order."
836,I go to order but the promo DOESNT WORK because it's for my first order only!!!
836,I've never felt more scammed in my life.
836,1 star is too generous for a bait and switch.
836,For all Uber employees I feel bad for you that your employer is a scammer and those who have been laid off there are better companies out there
1335,The app is only good for delivering food and the food at most times isn't even worth it which has nothing to do with the app itself but this app is so money hungry and greedy that If you do have a mistake with your order or your DoorDasher is unavailable to complete it you can only get a refund in tips and not the full price.
1335,Also I just accidentally spent $96 on a yearly subscription that I now have to use because I cannot contact them to get a refund or switch it to the monthly subscription like I wanted it .
1335,I honestly hate this app at this point and have had many many issues with it I do not recommend it to anyone anymore and I can't wait for my subscription to be up so I never have to use it again!
122,We have been faithful to Grubhub for years.
122,Lately they have been really lacking as far as accuracy and consistency.
122,Got a completely wrong order delivered and they said I had too many refunds on the account.
122,They had screwed up the last few orders but I had proof that this order was completely wrong and they said they wouldn't refund the order based on excessive refunds.
122,I canceled my membership immediately and will be using all the competitor apps instead.
122,Implied that we are liars when they can't get a simple order correct.
122,Goodbye
195,"If you are able to get a Grubhub Plus account, I recommend it."
195,"It's worth the savings with no delivery fee, which sometimes is what turns me off from a lot of places."
195,"Plus, there tend to be a lot of good local deals at any time."
259,Banking with Bank of America has its perks!
259,I have been able to save $$$$ on my delivery fees!
259,"Also, the food is almost always warm/hot when delivered."
259,I never would have gone through Grubhub if it wasn't for BoA!
291,They will always get your order wrong.
291,And then refuse to make it right.
291,I ordered the food because I wanted to eat it.
291,..You brought half of it.
291,And then refunded what you didn't bring.
291,"But then if I still want the food I ORDERED, I have to spend even more money than I was originally?"
291,And you also took increased taxes and delivery fees from the first order already.
291,..Poor form.
291,Garbage company.
291,Don't support it.
303,I just feel like it's kinda expensive especially when the driver has to do all the work.
303,A service fee?
303,Yeah grubhub just take away the delivery fee only to charge me extra on a service fee.
303,Sounds like grubhub is just taking advantage of their customers and drivers.
330,I feel like there have been too many incidences where the order was partially missing and they only refund you the cost of the missing food but not the delivery fees.
330,"Ordered four items, only one came and still had to pay the entire cost of fees."
330,It's unfair and should be addressed by Grubhub.
330,Shame on them.
336,"I live in a semi-rural area, next to a city with a major university."
336,"While my town has fantastic restaurants, it's incredibly convenient to have GrubHub+ so I can order delivery without the extra delivery fees!"
395,They over charge on everything!.I payed for Grubhub +(which would be 0 delivery fee) it's not even worth it cause everything still cost a lot (I have all these random fees ) that would make it add up to a lot.
395,You are better off going to the restaurant and places in person to save some money .
395,This app is not worth it.
439,"Even if you do Grubhub+ there are some businesses that ""don't participate in Grubhub+"" but you don't find out til the order submission."
439,"And now all the businesses have ""service fees"" in addition to delivery fees and driver tip."
439,I'll save myself the extra $15 and pick up my own food at that point.
530,"Gross, Awful, and unprofessional."
530,"I thought I liked the app at first, but the people who run it along with its drivers are AWFUL."
530,A driver spat in my food after I already paid SEVEN dollars for a delivery fee.
530,Was a $2 tip not enough?
530,Sorry I didn't tip to double the cost!
530,"When I went to report this order, I sent a complaint about the driver."
530,"After I sent this, I get a notification saying I tipped THE DRIVER almost $3."
530,The same one who completely disrespected me.
530,I didn't know a complaint came with money attached?!
530,They need an ACTUAL confirmation button with information on WHAT you're doing.
530,You can't just charge for everything you press on your screen.
530,"Based on what you tip and how much you spend depends on how you get treated, whether your order comes triple the time after it said it would, and if you get your food hot or cold."
530,And let us not forget that you can't cancel your order once a driver picks it up.
530,"Well dang, I didn't order an atrocious and slow delivery guy and I'm sure nobody else would."
530,"Disgusting, never again."
530,It's not worth your time or money.
530,Watch out for ratchet people named Steven!
750,"Absolutely clutch for multiple reasons, the service is immaculate and simply put it's a very convenient app to have, features and discounts can be very amazing, only complaint would be the premium which I had before but didn't really make a difference although it would say it made a difference, in terms of discounts on delivery fees and things of that nature."
750,Other than than I highly recommend this app👌🏾
911,Some people are in need of this service.
911,On top of delivery fee  they add on service fee  hmmmm  ok on to my point  my order should be correct and notes followed why do i have to eat a mess up by your delivery person who careless bout have they just drop ur food and leave yeah that was my last order had to toss cause it had bees in it   I specifically ask to let me know when here and i come right down  biggest issue is do you think uber cared not in the least no response nothing   If i could avoid todays order i would
1051,Usually when you order your meal it's comes to around $12 to $17 but then including the delivery fee you'll be paying the same amount or even more!
1051,I love the app for its UI and the freedom of being able to reorder my meals and how easily accessible it is to all.
1051,Just hope that they can do something about the delivery fees.
1051,:(
1164,"I have been using dashpass for a year now, in the past even though orders would get messed up, DoorDash did help a lot."
1164,"But ever since I moved to a new area, the prices and delivery fees went up even after 12+."
1164,I use the app because I am a full time student and working in between.
1164,"Now, I have to pay even more and recently multiple orders have been bad or completely missing multiple items."
1164,"Today, I hade ordered a meal and a large drink that happened to also be 3 dollars on its own."
1164,"While I was fine with that, the order came in and it was missing half the items Including that 3 dollar drink."
1164,"When I went to the help area Again, this time the app just flat out told me it couldn't help me with refunds and to have a nice day."
1164,The app is not worth it anymore.
1164,UberEats has restaurants in my area with less fees even Without the pass.
1164,"In the end I have canceled my subscription and deleted the app, I would rather just put up with ramen noodles for quick meals instead of being charged all this time for a pass that didn't do much for me eventually"
1176,I watch my driver on the app.
1176,It's obvious that several orders are being delivered at once.
1176,"Because of where I am located, I am always last in line."
1176,"By the time my food arrives, the things that are supposed to be hot are cold, and the things that are supposed to be cold or frozen are warm or melting."
1176,"When a special ""deal"" is offered, and I meet the criteria for the deal, I am still not able to actually get the deal."
1176,"And all the fees and prices have gone up so much, I often cancel out an order when I see the final total."
1176,This is true even with subscribing to the no delivery fee service.
1176,"When the tip is figured, I don't know what total they are basing it on."
1176,"For a $24 order, the ""20% tip"" was $6.50."
1176,"When they make a mistake or fail to deliver what has been ordered, they give you $5 back, even when your expense has been much more than that, and someone in your party didn't get their food."
1208,"I used DoorDash once and took advantage of ""free delivery"" for your first order, because of their new partnership with Chick-fil-a."
1208,"I ended up with a $5 credit because my order was an hour late, completely wrong and very cold."
1208,"In trying to use up my credit, I noticed that prices were higher normal."
1208,"I opened up my Postmates account and noticed that every single item I viewed from multiple restaurants was $1-$3 higher, with a higher delivery fee."
1208,"In fact, the price of the food was more than if I ordered directly from the restaurant."
1208,"What a disaster, I haven't used my $5 credit and am tempted to treat it as a loss...They have the delivery notifications with their ad notifications."
1208,Meaning you either receive delivery notifications and updates or you don't to avoid the STUPID ads.
1208,We're already using the app .
1208,Back off!
1263,"When the delivery fees are posted, they should be charged as such."
1263,"It blows my mind DoorDash gets away with adding additional delivery fees in a section called ""taxes and fees."""
1263,They should probably categorize the taxes separately so we know we're not paying tax on any intangible items like their fees on fees.
1263,Then they have the audacity to recommend we give like a 35% tip!?
1263,We tip on the total of items purchased.
1263,Not including the delivery fees and whatever other fees they try to hide.
1263,"A 20% tip on my $30 purchase (which was $40 after their ""2.99"" delivery fee) would be $6."
1263,And that used to be considered generous.
1263,"Yet I have to hit ""other amount"" and type in my generous tip as if I was doing something wrong."
1263,I'll delete the app and use others from now on.
1263,Hope the creators are spending their billions wisely.
1263,Like not ordering from DoorDash.
771,Great app if your being lazy to go out n grab items or food.
771,I mainly use for food if I don't feel like cooking or driving lol.
771,Wish there was a way to leave reviews for drivers they actually do a great job.
771,Something similar to DDash.
771,Locations could be a bit better they always go to the next street over from mine and I always have to text the driver.
771,Other than that great app and please tip your drivers.
1245,"I've wrote a review before and it was a 5 star but this is very frustrating, I've never been this upset with DoorDash but I am ."
1245,I am not lying or scamming DoorDash for credits but I've ordered food and got denied compensation due to having many reports but because DoorDash or the restaurant constantly mess up my food !
1245,I'm upset because I paid 17$ and couldn't even receive credit but completely am going to bed hungry!
1245,I haven't received my order and the dasher did not deliver it to the right address because it says she left it but I had not seen a SINGLE BAG FOR MY FOOD AND IM VERY UPSET I even feel hatred for DoorDash because of how often they've done nothing but completely messed up all my orders!
1245,PretttL is the name on DoorDash and I must say I'm very very mad still I worked too hard for the money I paid for that food for so I really was almost crying bc I just wanted food 🙃
107,Grubhub is a glitchy app that often is very frustrating to use.
107,It has wasted lots of time while trying to order a meal when I first started using it.
107,"I have since very rarely opened the app, often times it still had the same issues."
107,"However I have not encountered the same errors while ordering today, I don't know if their server infrastructure is improving or if I'm just lucky."
107,"I would like to use the service more, but I'm not sure if I would consider it reliable."
107,The drivers on the other hand are generally great and deliver the food warm usually.
451,App is fine but there are restrictions to free delivery promo.
451,Some restaurants not included which is disappointing.
451,There's no explanation or even a requirement set for minimum purchase.
451,I rather tip the driver that money so I chose another restaurant.
464,Grubhub + is very misleading.
464,I go to school at OSU and get Grubhub + for free.
464,Which includes free delivery.
464,You have to spend nearly $20 to get the free delivery and even then you aren't guaranteed free delivery.
464,It's very annoying when I only want one $6 meal but have to pay $13 for it…
965,"I think UberEats is the most careful of all good delivery services, it's backed by an easy to use platform with deals on free delivery, reduced delivery, something for everyone."
965,"If I were staying at a hotel and needed something to eat, UberEats would be my first choice in order delivery services."
965,Über thanks 👍🏽
473,"Thank you for a fast Delivery, my mom is in hospital and her food tray came and she was very dissatisfied, so I placed an order and you guys Delivered her food so fast!"
423,Apparently the delivery drivers take orders and only deliver them if they feel like it.
423,Multiple times the driver didn't bother to pick up the order leaving us wondering if we were going to get our food or figure something else out.
423,I deleted the app and won't be using the service again.
827,"UberEats has absolutely no concern on whether you receive the wrong item, are missing an item or an order is brought egregiously late."
827,They have absolutely no accountability for their vendors or drivers who deliver to PAYING customers that expect what they pay for!
827,Deplorable.
827,"Then will tell you, absurdly, that they can't rectify an incorrect order because it's happened multiple times."
827,Who's fault is that!?!?
827,It's not the customer.
827,"Pick better vendors, or vet better deliverers, but don't punish your customers!"
827,"Like myself, who orders frequently for business trips."
827,I think DoorDash just got a new customer.
829,"I was submitting my first order and it asked for my ID, I tried it multiple times and it was saying there was blurryness or a glare when there was none of that at all."
829,It wouldn't verify my ID after trying over 10 times.
829,"Then I retry and it does it again but when I hit the back button it said ""we've got your order, give the app time for it to show up"" and it has still yet to show up 10 minutes later."
829,I hate this app it takes way to much messing around and needing an ID to order food.
829,DoorDash is way easier and more simple.
829,DO NOT RECOMMEND THIS APP!!
829,!
902,So I've been having problems with mixed up orders and orders flat out not being delivered since I've downloaded this app.
902,But this last time I ordered a huge bbq feast and got brought someone's Lima bean soup and omelette from a different restaurant.
902,I was extremely upset.
902,But then they told me it wasn't eligible for a refund.
902,Because I had recently gotten one.
902,But it was also their fault.
902,So they'll screw up multiple times and end up taking your money.
902,I'm currently disputing it with my bank but this is rediculous!
1095,"Seth is great, and works very reliably now."
1095,But it is annoying how much they always make you rate the restaurant or you've ordered from multiple times.
1095,And they also sent so many pop-ups that are not relevant to a purchase.
1095,It's very annoying
971,"I got an amazing deal from my girlfriends phone, never used the app."
971,"Make an account, do everything the app wants; then they disable her account and we have no idea why."
971,Just wanted a good meal on a good deal; so instead of paying $20 through the offer THEY gave us we spend $40.
971,Never ever using this app again they'll just disable you for no reason and no explanation then make you spend even more money.
971,This is why I use DoorDash and not this crap app and I'm telling everyone else the same
1062,I Love Postmates because they have great service and good deals and the drivers usually I'll always get the orders right but when they don't they're ( Postmates customers service) always quick to make things right
1128,Experience from Sept 2022:  I set up a group order with a scheduled delivery date and time a couple days out on DoorDash.
1128,"The day we needed it to be delivered,I finalize the order first thing in the morning."
1128,The date and time I preset was noon on that particular day.
1128,"When I closed the order, it sent it to the restaurant and dasher immediately."
1128,It was delivered within 30 minutes - 2 1/2 hours before our scheduled lunch meeting time and before the time I entered when I set up the pre-scheduled delivery.
1128,"If the app is not going to remember a pre-scheduled delivery time, don't make that an option."
1128,It risks food spoilage.
1128,..Experience from last year:  DoorDash works out great when it works out.
1128,"However, the instructions for placing group orders are nebulous and not all restaurants have a group order link but it doesn't really say why."
1128,Also didn't know that a restaurant we tried to order with had $100 max.
1128,Would've been nice to know that before I entered $176 worth of items.
1128,Had to go back to the team to reassess who wanted what.
1128,Lunch was late because of that.
1128,That was after they are placed an order with one restaurant that turned out to be closed that day.
1128,"Like I said… When it works it's fabulous, and when we have today's experience, not so much."
690,"With Chick-Fil-A orders, the app doesn't let me select any of the required sides and drinks."
690,"The second I tap on my soda, the whole order is canceled."
690,"This is also happening with local restaurants...My other favorite ""feature"" is when the search shows you dozens of restaurants but when you tap them, it warns you ""this place will close in 3 minutes."""
690,"If the business hours are available, why not show them in the search results, or filter places that are closing soon?..All in all, Uber is ran by venture capitalists and overpaid programmers in Silicon Valley, and they underpay their contractors, who actually get the job done."
690,I want to stop using it but the alternatives aren't much better.
877,Just redownloaded this app on my phone.
877,Tried to order something from a local restaurant and wouldn't let me cash out because of a promotion to take .49 cents off was applied.
877,"It doesn't allow you to delete promotion, instead it insists you sign up for Uber one."
877,I will be cancelling Uber one I barely use Uber and very annoyed trying to order lunch but have to sign up for something I'm not interested in to get lunch delivered.
877,"As of Uber actually saves you money, they simply ""saved"" me 2.47 and really that's just them lowering the taxes and fees."
877,That they already collect money on.
877,Ok
830,"As drivers we are not happy with Uber… we are not being given information anymore, add in some of you don't tip."
830,"Ie… delivery comes up 5.5 miles pay 4.35 Two things on why we aren't going to fulfill this order(well a new or desperate driver will eventually) 1) we are not given any info Restaurant, location, drop off area 2) low pay, either because of Uber or customers being cheap."
830,Drivers don't care that you want to tip in cash… Because we have no guarantee of that.
830,This among many other reason is why we are not in a rush to fill these orders
74,"First time:..I ordered lunch and the driver arrived, did not call me, ""delivered"" the food in my apartment lobby and when i went down to get it, nothing was there."
74,..- there needs to be a better system of communication with the driver and the customer.
74,"Drivers want to get as many deliveries as they can and so they wont even wait a minute, and sometimes it works but sometimes they loose the food."
74,"..Second time: ..I ordered breakfast this morning, and when i checked the map, my driver was very far from both my home and the restaurant."
74,When i called him he said that the restaurant was closed and he had just kept working.
74,"I did not get a notification from him, and the app said that the restaurant was open."
74,..- The app cannot offer food from restaurants that are not open.
74,"And if they are closed, again, there needs to be a better system of communication between the driver and customer so i can know that it was closed, instead of just waiting 20 minutes."
126,"I ordered three items to be delivered between 12:40-12:50 and when it's just 10 minutes before it was supposed to be delivered it was delayed and then the driver changed because the restaurant was taking to long, then it was further delayed another hour and half."
126,"Then for the new driver to not even drop the order off in the right area or keep it for themselves, all I know this is completely unprofessional and has not been the first time this has happened I do not recommend to anybody"
178,Worst ordering experience my first time.
178,My order was dropped off 10minutes away and another persons with a totally different name and address on the ticket was brought to my house.
178,They didn't do anything just cancelled it and refunded the money but was already hungry and waited another 2.5hrs to hear sorry place is closed now nothing we can do.
178,Just super disappointed and if the drivers and vendors even just looked at the order and address this could be prevented.
178,Never assume always verify!
213,He didn't drop off my food when I was waiting at the drop off.
213,Refused to give any landmarks when I asked for them; and there are VERY obvious landmarks.
213,Grubhub gave me a re-delivery but decided to assign the SAME driver who didn't deliver the first time.
213,"Didn't accept my order cancel which is fine, but still decided to do a second delivery."
213,So the driver still got my money!
213,I'm okay with the restaurant being paired but why should he get my money when he ruined my night?
216,Twice when ordering from Applebees there were items missing from my order.
216,The first time a meal was left on the counter and the second time one item was missed.
216,Applebees said I need to contact Grubhub for a refund.
216,I was not able to find any contact info for Grubhub so I was out the food and the money.
216,On the second order I did tell them of the prior error in the comments but I surmise they don't care.
216,They got their money at my loss.
313,"Not the first time, here's the gist:.."
313,Delivery was promised in 40 minutes.
313,Driver was there on time.
313,Food was not close to being ready.
313,Driver left for another delivery.
313,Couldn't get any further info from the restaurant or the driver.
313,Neither did Grubhub… had to cancel after waiting for an hour and 45 minutes...All they can do is offer 10$ coupons
314,If I could give no stars I would.
314,Used Grubhub for the first time and the driver stole my food but luckily I got my money back.And they won't let me delete my account very trash delivery app
416,First time I have use it.
416,It was indeed awesome.
416,But I wish I could have had more choices of restaurants especially Captain Cook.
416,Great service!!
416,!
422,"Have not used GH in years, using it for the first time sort of was just so darn easy..Pop up and down arrows made sense."
422,Nailed it
447,"First time user of Grubhub, and received a phone call 10 minutes prior to when my order was going to be delivered advising that the restaurant did not receive my order and it would need to be canceled."
447,Not a great experience as a first time customer!
447,This will be the first and only time I use the service.
465,I placed my order and it would be here in 25-30 minutes which was fine.
465,But my food arrival got pushed back three times that it took over 2 HOURS to get here and it never did!
465,I'm so disappointed because this was my first time trying this app.
465,I'll never do it again.
770,Please make a button for Uber drivers to press IF they are sure to collect and deliver mutliple orders at a time because literally I was given 5 different drivers who kept on canceling and driving around playing with my time.
770,I sent the last driver a message and left me on read.
770,Unacceptable.
770,"If you can't take your side or full time job seriously, why be a good deliver in the first place."
770,This is not the first time this has happened to me and not the first time that I waited 1 hour or two for my paid food.
812,"First time using this app, only because I had a $25 promo to try it out."
812,BAD decision.
812,It doesn't allow you to modify your food orders and doesn't show a review of order or fees charged until after the order goes through.
812,"No option to chose payment information, took my card saved through Uber mobile app without confirming payment information."
812,Does not allow you to cancel order without being charged.
812,"Order arrives over an hour after placing, on a non-busy Sunday night at a non-busy hour after 8 PM and if course food is cold."
821,"No refunds, even if an entire entree is left out of the order."
821,"Policies aren't in place to make things right...We ordered a bunch of Chinese food for dinner, my fiancée didn't have his meal."
821,It took UberEats 2 days to respond and they said the order wasn't eligible for refund.
821,"First reason was that the restaurant doesn't offer refunds, then they said it was because we had requested too many refunds in the past - this was our first time ordering, we downloaded the app that day."
821,They are no longer responding.
821,Most other companies do what they can to do right by their customers.
887,"I love this app so much, this is my first time using it and I got so many discounts, the food came in the exact time it said it would and I could track my order from the time I placed it."
887,"I even seen that I can order my dog food from the store which is the most AMAZING feature to me, I absolutely LOVE this app and will always use it!!"
887,!
896,"me and my family want to surprise my little sister with her favorite fast food restaurant and instead of going out we ordered it on here when we ordered it on here the guy ""James"" confirmed he would be bringing our order keep in mind this is our first time using the app ever James tracking thing on the device disappears and he never delivers the food we talked to many people for refund or to find the guy there was no way they could track or contact him."
896,(I do not recommend buying this app you will 95% get stolen food or smushed food.)
898,I've tried ordering 3 times on this app.
898,The first time I got my order over 2 hours after I ordered it.
898,"The second time, the order was accepted and then cancelled after a long wait saying that the driver was unable to complete the order."
898,I decided to give them one more chance today.
898,"20 minutes after the app claimed I would get my delivery, the order was still pending and the restaurant hadn't even started making it, so I cancelled it."
898,I'm not impressed at all with them.
898,I hope other users have better experiences.
1106,I don't know if it's the drivers in my area where the restaurants but I always seem to have an issue with my orders that I recently ordered two times in one day the first time my order was missing part of it and later on my driver never brought my order and they got canceled I will still charge for it I am upset
1247,Wowza!
1247,I hadn't read any of the reviews before I placed my order.
1247,"In any case, I was very happy with the app as well as the speedy service."
1247,My delivery driver was kind and patient with trying to locate my place (he actually tried calling but I didn't realize that I had my phone on silent and I was out in my garden awaiting my order/watering plants).
1247,Thankfully I looked at my phone and saw that he had messaged me asking for more specific directions to my home.
1247,"Within a couple minutes of messaging him back, BAM!"
1247,My order was here!
1247,Yay!
1247,"First time Doordash user, definitely will be a repeat customer."
1247,Thanks!!
1247,:-)
414,Took a while to get but I ordered during traffic time but I must say it was hot crispy and really tasteful only problem is they forgot the drink and cookie that came with the pot pie meal other than that it was really good 😊
783,"They're definitely upping their selection of foods, and I'm also a part time driver and I can say the drivers are treated well and the drivers are usually very good."
783,However I feel the actual owners of the app should treat the customers better.
783,I waited 2 and a half hours for my breakfast during a slow time when everyone should be awake (8:30) they ended up canceling my order with no explanation or credit for the inconvenience.
783,Seems like they don't really care about their customers.
405,couldn't order from toppings for right half of pizza from the app.
405,"Only way to order was to ""reorder"" a pizza I ordered previously.."
485,With where I live it's the only way to get any quality food delivered.
485,I've noticed we're getting charged a delivery on top of a service fee and that just doesn't sit well with me.
485,But I guess it's my own fault for not planning a supper in advance.
26,"Not only is Apple somehow changing 1-star reviews to 5-star for this app, but in the app you can't even review a restaurant or driver once you have a problem."
26,Driver never delivered your food?
26,Can't leave a review to warn others.
26,Restaurant forgot half your meal?
26,Once you file for a refund you can't leave a review.
26,Forcing only positive feedback to make themselves and bad restaurants look good.
26,"I just ordered food and you can tell the restaurant intentionally ""forgot"" all of the free items like sauce and utensils, as well as more than half my food."
26,They only refunded me $11 so I ended up paying $32 for $7 worth of food.
26,"I don't know who is worse, Grubhub or DoorDash."
26,I've also had MULTIPLE drivers just disappear for 45 minutes.
26,Literally happened to me THREE times where I've cancelled orders because of a driver who probably went home.
26,Just pick up your own food folks.
26,Or use local delivery services.
26,Forget about these garbage corporations.
136,Inexcusably large upcharges and food is consistently 20-30 minutes late.
136,Food always sits under heat lamps for that time and you're left with paying 3 times the price of food for stale garbage.
136,"Just go get your own food, it's not worth it...Please note that while this app has a ""5 star"" rating, you'll notice that if you actually read the 5 star reviews they are all negative."
136,This leads me to believe that there is a finger on the scale here and that these reviews are being manipulated and/or bought.
136,Really poor form.
296,"UPDATE: Developer response is to say, ""contact customer care,"" but it sends you to a page where there is no customer care."
296,The whole service is a waste of time.
296,..I'm finally DONE with GrubHub.
296,"The mapping software keeps sending drivers to the wrong place and no matter what driver instruction I provide, it keeps happening."
296,Google and Waze can do it.
296,I don't know why GH can't.
906,Ordered tons of times through the app.
906,"Lately orders have been coming wrong, drivers canceling after 5-10 min wait."
906,Some orders are never picked by anyone and canceled.
906,"If half of ur lunch comes missing after an hour wait, they just reimburse you the amount for the missing part and you have to pay for delivery and mysterious other fees again to get the rest."
906,The fees are like 15% of the order and then you have to add tips on top which makes the whole thing not worth it.
1075,Their no ability to call which only leave text support.
1075,Every message took 10 to 15 minutes.
1075,It took so long to get a response from someone the app kept thinking I was afk and was asking was I still there while waiting for the other person to respond.
1075,"It took an hour of ""just give me a few minutes"" to be told what a policy is."
1075,Literally the worst delivery app I've ever used.
351,"Asian boneless chicken wings are good, ask for extra sauce."
351,"Onion rings are amazing, my grandson liked his ham and cheese sub."
351,They have kids subs.
351,Over all wish the kids subs was a few dollars cheaper.
351,I would recommend eating at Slacks.
42,So I've always used different delivery services and Grubhub always hits the right spot.
42,"I'm so disappointed to see a lot of bad reviews on Grubhub, because there's a lot of better support on Grubhub vs Doordash and Grubhub is an ethical service."
42,"My guess is on the App Store, Doordash dominates Grubhub unfairly."
42,"If you actually compare the prices from Doordash and Grubhub disregarding the prices, Doordash charges a lot more."
42,"And lastly Grubhub takes long, but somehow the food is always still magically warm?"
42,Compared to most delivery services?
42,As a customer I hope that Grubhub get the recognition it deserves and doesn't change.
1197,"When I lost my wife and surrogate children in a house fire following a freak accident involving our dog, twelve gallons of motor oil, and a poorly knit Hanukkah sweater that depicted Danny Devito passionately kissing Abraham on the lips, I had no way to cook my own food."
1197,DoorDash has served as my replacement family for three years now (some Dashers will roleplay as my wife if I give a big tip) and I have since fallen in love with the regular Dashers.
1197,Now the majority of them are married to me in a polyamorous relationship and we all live in an estate together in the Canadian country.
1197,Our twelve children are all Dashers which is where we obtain our income (all those married to me are retired now).
1197,DoorDash changed my life for the better.
1197,DoorDash was there for me when my family wasn't.
1197,Thank you DoorDash!
88,I frequently have issues with drivers being late or abandoning the order.
88,Too often you can see that they are making pickups and drop offs for other delivery services before satisfying Grubhub orders.
88,..They change the delivery time to meet their needs without consideration for the impact upon the food and the customer.
88,"They never apologize...I get that people are trying to earn a living, but delivering cold food that I'm having to pay a premium for is very frustrating."
88,Take pride in your work or don't do it.
88,A $5 discount for missing the delivery window by an hour just doesn't bring satisfaction.
99,I'm a full time student and single mom and I lost both my parents a long time ago.
99,My moms cooking was my life.
99,Grubhub comes in handy when i miss warm homemade food and I don't have the wherewithal to make food for just myself.
99,Now I know why my mom never wanted to cook for just her only if I was eating dinner too!
99,It's hard.
99,Im probably being dumb and spending too much money but hey this service is keeping me alive.
99,🙂
571,they are thieves they stole my money whenever I asked for my orders they took time to assign the delivery person and I had to cancel my last order because it took a long time to assign my delivery person I had to wait for the hours for my order to arrive and the restaurant was at Only 7 minutes from my house I despaired of waiting for him to assign me to the person who would deliver my order and I decided to cancel it.
571,I went to the restaurant myself to buy a lot of food and asked about that order and he told me.
571,"that if it had been canceled by uber or that they had not charged anything because uver canceled it and they never returned my money to my account they stole 56 dollars from me and they have not returned it to me apart from giving bad attention in assigning the relauncher without Madrones, because if a client does not receive any food and the restaurant does not charge anything, you keep the money 😡"
1074,"To bad delivery services wasn't around a long time ago, it's just not for Pizza!"
1074,Gives people jobs and the one's that don't want to go out and get the food the opportunity to order whatever they crave!!
1074,!
3,"Today is Monday, September 26, 2022, and this is the second time that I have had an issue with GrubHub delivery."
3,"I've been tracking this driver and he or she has been driving around in my neighborhood and didn't even bother to  get to my address so therefore I felt that my food would've  been cold upon arrival and now it was abruptly cancelled, so now I am re-ordering once  again.😡 I am a senior citizen and I am disabled, the name of the complex is Mayflower Gardens Senior Apartments."
3,I wished that the driver would keep in mind that some of us older customers are not as quick to get to the door and we are not dumb or stupid.
3,"I know know how to read apps, and I know my directions,when they come, and some of them in the past will abruptly leave your order at the door on the ground and not even bother to knock."
3,I am requesting a re-order once again because I have tracked the last driver and he or she was in my neighborhood and I'm not sure if they were lost or not but it would be nice if they were use the GPS system more effectively so that they can find my address.
3,Please know that  is why I am really hesitant to order with you in the near future if this continues to happen.
3,Needless to say I am not happy at this time.I noticed that a female driver will be delivering my order shortly and I hope that it'll arrive in time.
224,Best experience I have ever had with a delivery service !
224,"Not sure how they handle undelivered items so maybe I am biased at the moment but the food was warm and on time , can't say enough about my delivery person ."
275,I've had two deliveries from Grubhub.
275,I gave written directions for the contactless delivery.
275,Both delivery persons left the food at the incorrect door.
275,I don't know if the app is working incorrectly and not passing the delivery instructions to the driver or if they were both careless.
288,This is an add in that was not there until.2020.
288,Should be removed.
288,It's the amount of tip I give to the delivery person.
288,I used to order Grubhub 2-3x weekly.
288,Because of the Service fee maybe 3x monthly.
290,Forever annoyed that they are tacking on fees and keeping it for themselves and not passing it along to the delivery person.
290,.Eight dollars in fees just to run GrubHub and I have to pay an additional five dollar tip to a delivery person?
290,Even more annoying as you can't directly order from the restaurants themselves because they bought into the service.
290,Super disappointed.
290,Times have changed.
295,"I ordered a food from through this company, at Norcross GA. and for some reasons the delivery personnel made a choice to leave the food on some chair at the hotel without informed any one."
295,While I was waiting for my orders.
295,Effort to trace this particular chair as well as contact Grubhub hasn't been successful.
295,I'm ordering my bank not no to pay for such a bad service acclaimed.
295,I'm suspecting this delivery services as fraud.
295,No one should trust the services
432,Seems no matter how detailed the instructions are to get to my door they always take my food to the wrong place.
432,One driver even left the food at the curbside.
432,.I only use them because I'm disabled.
432,"But, they asked me to walk around and see if I could find the food instead of getting on the driver/delivery person."
471,"Even with grubhub pro and a $12 tip for food from a restaurant 2 miles away, the delivery person is now on the other side of town (10+ miles away) delivering another order before mine because that TOTALLY makes sense."
471,"If you enjoy wasting your money for cold food, look no further!"
97,I've had a number of issues with GrubHub delivery most recently.
97,The driver will drop the food at the doorstep and walk away.
97,"I later, sometimes, will get a text indicating that the food has been delivered."
97,"Unfortunately, this notification comes to me as late as 20 minutes which means that my food is cold and then two cases raccoons have gotten to it."
97,"Not appreciating the lack of care these drivers show even though in my delivery instructions, I specifically indicate not to put it on the floor."
240,"I have very specific, yet simple, delivery instructions."
240,Most drivers respect them.
240,Some seem to not be able.
240,"A few have been downright rude, citing the amount of tip (20%) as insignificant and not enough to make it worth delivering to my door."
273,"More of a criticism of GH, not the drivers or restaurants."
273,"When we add delivery instructions, SHOW THEM TO THE DRIVERS."
273,GPS is NOT always accurate and it is such a waste of time to have to go find the driver because GH didn't show them the delivery instructions.
273,"..Fix yer ish, GH."
368,This is completely unacceptable.
368,This is why we stopped using Grubhub a year or so again.
368,"Your service is terrible, and you are completely insensitive to the customer having a lunch hour...Thought we would try you again, and sorry that we did."
760,Literally worst app known to man.
760,"I waited over 2 hours for my ""priority"" order and they said my first driver took my food and never delivered it."
760,Then said it was a glitch.
760,Then said the new driver has the food and is at the restaurant awaiting the order.
760,Then told the restaurant specifically NOT TO REMAKE MY ORDER.
760,This is completely unprofessional.
760,"I spent $100 on food for my colleagues and I.. it was never delivered and I am paying for their ""glitch""."
760,I wasted my lunch hour waiting on this food that never came.
760,They didn't even take my calls and then said well we gave you a $10 credit!
760,What a joke.
760,Never again.
760,Doordash or Grubhub baby!
63,"Yesterday I had ordered Dairy Queen and additional toast, but when it got here it wasnt toasted and was just soggy warm bread."
63,"The driver was amazing and even made it inside to put the food by my door rather than just outside, so I gave them an additional tip."
63,Afterwards I made a claim with the toast and they refunded me everything.
63,"Tip included, with no warning."
63,"I told them that had they told me the driver tip would have refunded, I would have opted out of the refund...They gave no warning and when I asked if there was no way around that, I get told ""They make salary anyway""."
63,Tips can be everything to a driver and it was such a negative interaction that I wont be using the service again.
63,"Treat your drivers better, Grubhub (and any 3rd party delivery service)."
929,"I ordered food, my driver goes to the restaurant and says they ran out of everything, they can't complete your order."
929,The driver and the restaurant leave my order open and now I can't cancel to reorder anything else.
929,Support has a robot prompt that doesn't address a scenario where a vendor doesn't know how to use the app.
929,This is becoming a 50/50 nightmare on getting food that actually arrives.
929,"Use a competitor, never had an issue with doordash ever."
929,I've had so many issues with Uber over the years my patience is thin.
1181,DoorDash is great when placing your order thru the app.
1181,"However, when it comes to actually receiving your order, I would rate a -5 if I could."
1181,"It's a continuous cycle of my wife and I placing orders, and the dasher Never delivers to our home."
1181,They always drop our order off to another house.
1181,"We've been fortunate enough to walk as far as 4 streets over just looking for our order and finding it, but even calling and messaging our Dasher to tell them per the app, you're not even on our street is brutal as the Dashers ignore all communication efforts."
1181,"Smh.. if the Dashers are not using GPS to make their deliveries, then DoorDash should find a more productive method to screening Dashers and making sure they know how to read addresses."
1181,"What's worse is that this occurs so much with our orders, sometimes DoorDash refuses to give us a refund of our order because we have had submitted too many issues with our orders not being delivered."
1181,DoorDash definitely needs to audit themselves and their Dashers and Restaurant accuracy of fulfilling orders.
142,Maybe if grubhub wants their orders to be on time they should actually put more of their $$$ into paying their drivers.
142,"So overpriced, but the drivers get pennies."
142,Prices on app much higher than real restaurant costs (before all the fees are added too).
142,ETA on the app is a joke and it doesn't update accurately and the app does not consider it an issue when an order is hours late.
142,Restaurant will make your order and it can be waiting there for 2 hrs before someone picks it up.
142,Do you get any refund for this?
142,"No, but you get $7 of store credit!"
1284,It's painfully obvious that you don't pay your Dashers as you should.
1284,"Tipping them as much as I am, I feel like I am footing the paycheck."
1284,"You shouldn't suggest as much as you do, and I shouldn't have to tip like I do."
1284,..Also.
1284,At least give me the opportunity to give a tip AFTER I receive the meal.
1284,Why would I tip without knowing what the service quality is.
1284,It doesn't make any sense.
1284,Half the time there is an issue with the order of delivery time is wrong.
1284,And I'm not new here.
1284,I've spent a good portion of my income receiving food.
1284,"..I still love the service option, but you need to adjust the cost, because I can compare to other services that clearly don't try and make me feel bad about offering a tip I can afford."
1284,"And a tip is for extra, not for the expected service."
154,I love the convenience of Grubhub and I have used it quite a few times.
154,"I have always had great drivers, the only issue I really have is a recent one where when I order the driver can pick up multiple orders."
154,This causes issues because by the time I get my food it's never warm enough.
154,When I order and I'm given a time and then it changes by 20+ minutes it's happened enough to where I don't want to continue using the app
358,Have placed a bunch of orders and a few times it's wrong what we get should the restaurant pay for Grubhub to bring back the correct order?
870,I love this app!!
870,"The few times I have had an issue, they are quick to resolve it, it's so convenient when needed!"
870,"By the way, if you can afford to order food on this app then TIP THE DRIVERS WELL."
870,"Don't be a cheap a**, if things are so tight there you can't tip the person doing you a convenience then you should go get it yourself!!"
870,!
916,Whomever approved the latest update for iPad made a huge mistake.
916,Now when I view 99% of the restaurants I to they pop up in a window the size of an iPhone Max.
916,It took me forever to realize you have to scroll to the right to be able to make a selection or even see what you selected.
916,On one order I placed I hit the screen the few times but saw no check marks and didn't realize I made more selections than I wanted.
916,I paid way more than I wanted AND didn't get the order I want.
916,Unacceptable.
1232,I've ordered a few times from DoorDash and honestly support is impossible.
1232,"Usually if I have to get something from a store, they don't even list the right available items."
1232,I have to go through support and try to change the substitutions they allow to get what the driver says is available.
1232,Honestly at this point it's less of a headache to get it myself!!!
1232,Not to mention support takes forever and usually just cancels the order when this happens so I get nothing.
1232,"Not to mention I was promised credits as part of a refund when this last happened, they were never delivered, and when I asked support about it again they said they basically had no clue what I was talking about!!!"
1232,"It didn't use to be this bad, the app was great for getting supplies when I had Covid, but it really went downhill!😡😡😡"
914,"Most of the time I like this app and the people are fast and nice but todays experience has put a bad taste in my mouth because after ordering a small kids meal and a Lemonade Wich it said the full total drive, tax and tip included would be 10 $ but then it's suddenly jumped to almost $30 I thought maybe it was a glitch till I looked at my recent they sent to my email ☹️ I'm still hoping after they see this it'll be fixed my meal only cost 10 idk how it all got jumped to 30"
989,"When I'm starving and can't find anything open, it's always Sherrys."
989,The food is good and most times it's always hot and delicious.
989,I don't know what you're waiting for order something you'll be happy that you did.
420,App worked fine until it made me sign up for 30 day free Grubhub+ after the entire initiation of the order stemmed from the link through our PRIME membership.
420,Unlikely coincidence onsidering tech-savyness of both companies.
1244,My account has been deactivated for no reason twice in the last 3 months and then a few days ago i had ordered food and didn't receive part of my order.
1244,i contacted support in order to either get my food or a refund for the stuff i never got.
1244,"the lady on support told me there was nothing she could do and refused to let me speak to a supervisor or superior (which i wasn't going to do to get her in trouble, i know some things they don't have the power to override)."
1244,i hung up and called back because i wasn't taking the unnecessary rudeness anymore and the next person told me they could issue me a credit which i was fine with.
1244,I hung up and thought nothing of it but today opened the app to find it had been deactivated again.
1244,doordash is literal trash and i will never be buying anything through them again
179,I was a grubhub+ member but after today I canceled.
179,Whenever I use this app to order either my order arrives missing entire items or the food is undercooked(burgers especially).
179,Today I didn't receive my entire order and when contacted for a refund was told they couldn't do it because of my recent refund requests and they can offer a $10 off coupon.
179,No I want my money back to spend on something else.
179,Would not recommend.
192,I love that Grubhub finds most of the best places around where you might be.
192,"I work long works at different place throughout the week and Grubhub makes it easy and so convenient to get happy healthy food to me no matter where I'm at, Thank you!"
986,Why is it only 4 addresses??
986,It makes no sense.
986,"I work in more than 3 different places, and I often visit my family, so I NEED to add more addresses."
986,"Also, you should allow the user to save as 2 diff addresses, e.g."
986,"one for day delivery and another one for evening delivery, because the access doors can vary, even if it is the same building."
986,It's amazing you haven't contemplated this basic need yet.
1002,overall it has most of all the restaurants I like on the app and rewards are always good .
1002,Has a wide variety of different places to eat from and again always has offers .
1002,It's just the taxes when you got to checkout that's the only issue lol
900,Disgusting.
900,Just the worst food delivery service there is.
900,They lie about their deals.
900,They lie about taking my your order.
900,"They'll say a restaurant is preparing your order and then you'll find out an hour later that the restaurant was never open in the first place(not open the whole day) and they just kept you waiting for an hour for no reason...UPDATE: Now, they took thousands of earned free dinners from people because they just took all of the points away and stopped the rewards system."
900,This company should be shut down.
305,Grubhub is such a great app to use.
305,They have a lot of deals to where you can get so much money off or free items!!
305,Soo much better than DoorDash by far.
305,The drivers are nice and efficient!
305,!
857,Uber will just cancel orders.
857,If you pay for UberOne.
857,They'll wait right up to the min of latest promised to delivery (with driver in route) to cancel your order just save $5 from guaranteed delivery promise.
857,Reaching support is darn near impossible because they don't let you just reach out.
857,If you do manage to get their app to let you communicate.
857,They'll just send you a generic reply back not fully addressing your issues and close out your ticket so you can respond back.
857,This is all done immediately.
857,On several occasions.
857,So it's just horrible service.
938,You would think that a company as established as Uber wouldn't pull shady nonsense but unfortunately they do.
938,I am sick and tired of receiving emails with discount codes that only work for one or two restaurants in my area.
938,when I try to place an order I find out at checkout that whatever nonsense they sent me in an email does not work.
938,I am sick and tired of their crap and will no longer be using this app.
938,There are too many other delivery options available that don't pull moves like this.
938,Bye Uber
1047,"I swear on everything I love, my delivery driver removed the staple from the bag my food  came in and took more than half my food."
1047,I will never trust my food being delivered from anywhere again.
1047,"Not only that, when I called and told support what happened he act like he couldn't find my order."
1047,My suspicion of the delivery driver was confirmed when I reached out to the store I bought the food from and they knew exactly what I was talking about and confirmed to me that there were many other cases with the driver.
1047,Smh
1089,i only don't like 1 thing about postmates is that they give the drivers so many other deliveries before mine.
1089,I had to wait 1 hr 30 mins before receiving my order just because the delivery driver had like 5 other orders.
1089,Like how does that leave your food fresh when y'all are giving the drivers many many other orders.
1241,My first experience with this restaurant is the best first experience I've ever had with a restaurant.
1241,They far exceeded my expectations.
1241,I tried a bunch of different dishes and they were all amazing.
1241,I ordered the Mac and cheese but they were out of it so they substituted the Rasta pasta.
1241,So happy with the substitution!
1241,The lunch special curry chicken was flavorful and had the perfect amount of heat.
1241,The steamed vegetables were tasty and not overlooked like in so many other places.
1241,The rice was perfectly cooked and was a great compliment to the chicken.
1241,The jerk chicken empanadas we're out of this world!
1241,And the sweet plantains were the perfect end to the meal.
1241,Pretty sure I'm going to order dinner from them tonight.
474,The delivery driver forgot one of my kids meals and the other got his so there's not a good situation at my house.
474,I have to re-order something pay more money and watch my kids argue over who gets what after paying almost $100 for four meals.
474,This is ridiculous.
474,Do not recommend GrubHub or this driver especially.
1029,"It's perfect , how to find what you like?"
1029,".The convenient symbol Postmates uses .shows who has the highest customer  ratings, -that's symbol is quite helpful,."
1029,and this app is pretty awesome too.and if you join on a membership that saves you more money.
1029,"Often it's cheaper than the way I shop  and ya gotta love no dishes and servers willing to deliver, pretty helpful!"
893,Good experiences every time so far with Ubereats.
893,I use it for myself and for company orders.
893,"It's just easy to miss which card it's on, and I can only select personal or company card right before finalizing the order."
893,To me it would make more sense to pick a card before adding the tip and seeing the total.
1066,"I enjoy there delicious food here it's very clean.very fresh they have very good food here I .highly recommend eating here at Carson's Ribs .regardless if you eat in, carry out or order online delivery it's always the very best service and .quality so just enjoy enjoy enjoy!!"
1066,!
256,It's so dang expensive.
256,It literally doubles the cost.
256,$30 for $15 order...Update: I called like they suggested and they said I could have a five dollar credit toward my next order.
256,"I told them I wasn't going to be using them again and they told me they tried to give me a refund but ""the system wouldn't let me."""
256,..Changing to one star.
256,You literally added insult to injury and wasted my time.
91,I have used this service to order breakfast or lunch at work.
91,I'm not sure who they hire as their drivers but twice these driver have given my food to the wrong person.
91,EVEN THOUGH I HAVE INSTRUCTIONS FOR THEM TO CALL AND SPEAK TO ME.
91,I work in healthcare so I don't always have time to grab lunch or breakfast for work and depended on them to get me my order.
91,They gave me a free Grubhub upgrade pass that does not reduce the cost like they advertise.
91,So save your money.
91,And now they are offering me $10 to make up for the fact that I waited an hour for my food and the driver just gave my food to the first person they saw.
91,I am so disappointed in Grubhub.
91,You can do better when hiring.
214,"Be warned—if you're ordering group lunch for you and your co-workers, the receipt GrubHub provides is not itemized… it only lists the amount for your order, even if you paid the whole bill."
214,Itemized receipts are a requirement most companies have when it's time to get reimbursed.
214,I was shocked when the GrubHub costumer care representative just told me I'd need to contact everyone of my coworkers who ordered food using the Group Order link that's generated through the Apps..I'd stick with UberEats.
231,Drivers seem to think they don't have to go into the building to deliver your food but simply text you and tell you I am here.
231,When there's a clear note in the comments asking it to be delivered to a specific place and your name.
231,Then I'm given a credit thankfully and a coupon for my troubles that I can't even use on the replacement order because my replacement order isn't even big enough.
231,I'm done with GrubHub...Hangry
385,Prices keep going up while service and speed continue to decline.
385,"Unless you have no other option, grubhub is definitely not worth paying double for your food just to get it an hour later."
385,If you get it at all.
701,"Love this app, hate the service fees."
701,It's next to impossible to get a hold of anyone to resolve any issues that arise and not easy to get refunds.
701,"This app is a necessity, however for all those late, cold and rainy nights and the days and nights where there is nothing for miles."
701,"My two biggest pet peeves are that they allow people on bicycles to deliver, so if the driver does not insulate your food properly it will be cold, and the fact that it asks you to tip as you are completing your order."
701,"It's like, let's see how the service is, right?"
1302,I love DoorDash because it has all of my family's favorite food.
1302,It is so easy to place your order and go.
1302,"But, there are 2 problems about DoorDash."
1302,Number one is that it takes 40-50 minutes to get to you.
1302,"Usually it's in the forty's, but sometimes it takes longer."
1302,Number two is that sometimes they mix the orders or something is missing from the meal.
1302,"Also, if you/we get someone's else's order, what if we are allergic to their food, or their allergic to our food."
1302,That might be a problem.
1302,"But, other than that, I love DoorDash and I would recommend getting DoorDash."
1302,😁
200,I love Grubhub they are able to bring me and my family dinner when I'm exhausted after a long day at work or just have to much going on to break away!
200,Very useful and my food has always been delivered still hot and in a timely fashion!
200,!
377,"I love Grubhub but I do not love that some restaurants are just certain foods from other restaurants listed, I.e ""wild burger"" being just a list of burgers from Buffalo Wild Wings."
377,It is very deceiving because it doesn't state that in menu.
415,I like that they pay their drivers.
415,But the app could use some work.
415,It froze to where I couldn't make any selections and had to close/open a couple times to get back to my orders.
354,"EVERYTIME I order it seems something is made wrong, missing, or it's SO late it's still gay or freezing, stuff spilled-last time they delivered an almost empty spilled drink.. they never ever remember the condiments, it's SO much for delivery and taxes..and other fees..it's just a lot of extra money to have the wrong items or cold late items delivered."
379,Restaurants should not be able to charge the customers extra money b/c the app hasn't been updated to show the new prices.
379,That's not the customer's fault.
315,Grubhub listed a restaurant near me under a nationally-recognized name when in fact it was a poorly-rated local place.
315,The time estimate increased by an hour because the restaurant had to sub rice for noodles; I was committed at that point.
315,"I thought, ""surely this won't take a whole hour."""
315,The driver then proceeded to drive around with my food for the whole hour while making other pick-ups and deliveries.
2,I've used GrubHub for years and thought it was great!
2,"Unfortunately, my account got hacked and someone used my account to order $40 worth of food and then changed the email on the account so they could change the password."
2,"As soon as I noticed the charges and reported it to Customer Care, I got an email saying they moved my inquiry to ""priority"" due to the serious nature of the concern and that they would be in contact with me shortly."
2,"The email also suggested I reset my password if possible, but I can't since the hacker changed my account info."
2,Days go by and nothing.
2,I sent an email on the same thread asking for an update and a refund and still nothing.
2,It's been about 2 weeks and I still have not received a response.
2,"I was able to remove my payment from my account, luckily, but now I still can't use my account because of the account log in change...EDIT:.The same day I posted this review, GrubHub got back to me and sent me a refund and helped solve my issue so I adjusted my rating."
2,"I do think that serious matters like this should be handled quicker, but do appreciate them handling the situation in a fair manner."
309,"I ordered bread and a steak with two sides from a restaurant, once I was handed the bag I realized the bread wasn't there so I refunded for it, just to get back inside and open the actual container for the food and the steak isn't there either just the two sides, so I'm trying to refund for it and it won't let me it keeps taking me back to the restaurant page."
309,It was almost 30 dollars and I got nothing from it?
309,?
82,The last several times I've ordered using Grubhub were epic Fails.
82,".This order was super fast, and everything was there!!"
82,"I've written you guys off so many times and for some reason keep coming back and putting myself through it, because at first you guys were so good!"
82,The girl that did my order yesterday was perfect.
82,"Time will tell for sure, but thank the girl that did my order yesterday…she ROCKED."
616,It is very convenient to be able to order food at will.
616,"But sometimes, it's not worth it to spend the cost of another meal just to order 2 burgers and some fries."
616,".Also, there is no accountability between UberEats and the participating restaurants."
616,"If the same restaurant keeps making the same mistake, (and with food) almost killing someone, I need to know what actions are being taken to rectify it."
616,..Don't offer me a refund when I didn't ask for it and then tell me I cannot report improper food in the future.
616,Good business fixes/addresses the issues.
616,Bad business will get someone sick or worse.
616,"Make your money, but stop screwing your customers."
191,NEVER seem to get food delivered on time.
191,Can literally be a mile away from the store and somehow have to wait an hour and a half to two hours for EVERY order.
191,"The ""care"" specialist just feed you the same lines they were clearly force fed and then you repeat the process all over again on the next order."
191,The best part?
191,"Paying a subscription so that grubhub ""guarantees"" on time delivery and STILL having NEVER had an order delivered on time."
191,Terrible company.
191,Terrible service.
342,Love the service and product but the app has a lot of competition.
342,User friendly and has great deals in ur local area; also has a majority of restaurants and fast food in your local area.
849,It seems that while processing a payment is never a problem for Uber; appropriate customer care is not top of mind.
849,How can I have a 20 minute text chat with a rep regarding a personal and a business account and then receive an email stating I am not eligible for a refund when I never requested one?
849,Furthermore there is no live chat option and the representatives are less than knowledgeable.
849,"Kudos to you for not laying off any employees; however, a tech support seminar would only do you some good."
849,I will not be shopping with Uber for the time being.
849,Very disappointing.
1200,DoorDash is a Top Drawer💎✅ dinning Restrurant/Delivery service.
1200,"You speak🗣, DoorDash listens👂🎶✔️.Dear Customer Care Dining Professional,.Please, you have been most kind in handling my concerns of food quality and safety."
1200,We have enjoyed a variety of foods that have satiated our palates.
1200,"However, unfortunately, there have been disappointing experiences (large and small) which have been resolved in an expeditious and professional way to our satisfaction."
1200,I applaud you.
1200,"I only hope you would consider having an ""undercover shopper"" for restaurants that know the food does not match the advertised quality described."
1200,That would hold them to the high standard that you have come to represent to me in your handling of the grievances.
1200,".Thank you, again.Imer"
159,I have tired to order twice now and my orders was canceled immediately after the payment was taken out my account.
159,Now I'm out $400 waiting for the refund which takes up to 5 days.
159,The order needs to be canceled before the payment is done.
159,This will take out your money then cancel ur order just to hold ur money for up to 5days.
159,I called the restaurant and they said they never got my order.
159,This is the last time I LEND my money to Grubhub.
367,My second try with this app and there's issues on communication between customers and distributors last time.
367,Hope this is better.
703,"If you turn off notifications , you don't know where your driver is ."
703,"If you leave on notifications , you get bombarded with ads for junk food you never in a million years would order ; all day long ."
703,App is a total failure and makes it unusable as far as I am concerned for this reason .
703,No one wants coupons all day .
703,"Further , their drivers often make more than one stop , taking FAR FAR longer than if you order from the restaurant direct."
703,I got food poisoning the last time and have had dangerous delivery drivers lie about their location .
703,"Uber refunded me ; but nonetheless , ordering direct from the restaurant eliminates all of this an is always at least 25% cheaper ."
1040,"Every time I come back to postmates because they offer a discount, I regret it."
1040,My orders are always late because drivers take multiple orders and deliver to areas very far away from my delivery address.
1040,"But, you don't know this until after placing your order."
1040,I placed an order from a restaurant 20 minutes away.
1040,It's been 1.5 hours since I placed the order and I have yet to receive it.
1040,Food is consistently cold because of the significant delays in deliveries.
1040,This is the last time I will ever use their service.
371,"I was briefly in NY, no problems and everything arrived within promised range."
371,I will likely use again next time I travel.
263,And the GH driver kept changing their delivery time.
263,Showed up over an hour late with hot food stacked on top of sashimi without even a cardboard barrier after driving around with it for an hour like that.
263,And.
263,"He admitted he ran somewhere else all the way across town even though ""I was first""."
263,I had to trash all of my over $65 worth of food and GH nor the restaurant offered me a refund.
263,"Though, it was an inedible health hazard."
263,I'm a Chef.
263,And this disgusts me.
840,"My order was going to be over an hour late and when I contacted support the robot asked if I wanted to cancel my order and I clicked ""No, keep my order"" and it put in the chat that I said to cancel my order."
840,I had been waiting over an hour since I put my order in at that point.
840,They did not give me any credits and when I was speaking with an agent (the agents name was Cesarlo) they did not address my issues and took awhile to actually respond to me.
840,I 100% DO NOT RECOMMEND using this app what so ever!
840,DoorDash is a MUCH better option and I should've stuck with them.
1083,This app used to be good but it just is consistently late over and over again with how the Postmates team allows order stacking with drivers.
1083,You basically wait on other people's orders now...You can order and have food arrive an hour late as is my current experience right now as I write this app.
1083,..Uninstalling after tonight.
1083,Will take my business elsewhere.
193,If a business is closed or not accepting orders.. it should not be available for me to fill my cart.
193,So many times I have been charged (also refunded) but turns out the restaurant is closed.
193,"Yes, I was refunded but my money gets tied up."
193,The food is cold most of the time with orders not having the correct items.
193,You force user to waive their rights yet continue to screw over the customer.
193,So over subpar companies doing what they want instead of doing what's right.
1082,I ordered my food at 7:00 at night it's said 40-50 minute wait.
1082,Then it said my order would be ready by 8:20 and I'm okay with that.
1082,For the next 2 hours while I'm sitting there starving it kept going up and up until it reached 10:00.
1082,Then the order just cancels and I waisted three hours for nothing.
1082,All they give is a crummy refund.
1082,This has happened many times before.
1082,I'm deleting the app.
381,"It's suspicious that Grubhub has so many reviews that are overwhelmingly negative, but still show as five stars."
381,"Anyway, every time we've used them, the map always shows the driver going to the restaurant, then going to a completely different restaurant and doing another delivery before they finally arrive with your order."
794,"Ordered food, was suppose to arrive by 7:30."
794,"Received a notification it would arrive by 7:40, then another notification that it would arrive by 7:50."
794,But don't worry we will give you $5 in Uber bucks if it doesn't arrive by the original promised time of 7:30.
794,Well an hour after placing the order it was canceled with no reason.
794,All to avoid giving $5 in Uber bucks?
794,"I am pregnant, on bed rest and have diabetes."
794,"What I would like is my food, in stead nothing, not even something for my troubles."
794,I could have used another delivery service an hour ago and had my food by now.
1170,Unfortunately I was unable to continue using doordash because apparently when you have a dasher driver account AND  a personal doordash ordering app under the same email issues can arise.
1170,I decided to take the doordash ordering app off my phone because now I want to cook more.
1170,Due to me deactivating my personal doordash ordering app it ended up kicking me out of my dasher driver account.
1170,I called support and they confirmed that the issue was connecting one email to both accounts.
1170,Where it went wrong was when I was ASSURED that both accounts could be separated and that it would take 24/48 hrs.
1170,I let over 48 hrs pass AFTER many log in attempts throughout the day.
1170,I called support again today and support then tells me that it is not possible to separate my accounts without reactivating the personal account and changing my email and I think thats unfair that I had to call and find that out.
1170,On top of the the support person I spoke also let m know that my request to separate my accounts was never possible so why assure me that it was?
1170,That did it for me.
454,"Just wish there were more options, especially coffee!"
1100,Love how many more options you can choose from than other restaurant take out/food apps.
926,Our last experience much better then tonight's.
926,"When I didn't see a choice for extra cheese ( we like ours very cheesy), I checked shredded and fresh mozzarella."
926,Both box labels indicated our choices but unfortunately there was only several discs of fresh on the pies and lots of area with just sauce.
926,.Since it's most likely just a mistake and our order several weeks ago was perfect we may try them again
12,I ordered from Tucanos for my 30th birthday dinner.
12,"It was set to arrive at around 5:40, perfect for dinner time."
12,About 5:30 the driver called to tell me Tucanos doesn't sell the thing I ordered.
12,"When I asked her to ask them for a substitution, they said THEY AREN'T SELLING ANY TAKEOUT ORDERS THIS MONTH."
12,"By the time I could order something else from DoorDash and have it arrive, I was eating dinner at 7 while my kids were getting ready for bed, they having had grilled cheeses."
12,"You have ONE job, Grubhub App."
12,Confirm the order so the driver can pick it up.
12,Clearly Tucanos didn't confirm they could fill the order before you wasted my time and the driver's time on the order.
12,I hope you paid her.
12,Your process requires revision.
12,You know what's worse than having to go get your own food because a restaurant won't do delivery?
12,HAVING NO FOOD BECAUSE YOUR APP DROPPED THE BALL!
12,I hope you fail by losing your customer base to Doordash's superior app and process design.
12,"..UPDATE: Developer has responded to my complaint by asking me to use their ""contact us"" option on their site."
12,There is not actually a way to contact them at the link provided.
1236,"Their dasher hit my car, the dasher's insurance doesn't cover me because they don't cover rider services, and DoorDash denied me even after further investigation determined their dasher was found to be at fault."
1236,It's been over a month and have not gotten any further word from DoorDash after numerous attempts to get an update or answer on my claim.
1236,"Just a warning to current and future users of DoorDash, there is a huge loop hole that allows drivers with subpar coverage to drive for DoorDash and in the event of something like this happening, the customer or bystander is left dry to pay for damages that were completely the fault of the DoorDasher and DoorDash entirely when they refuse to do the right thing."
1236,You're better off picking up your own food if you're just going to be held accountable in the event of damages occurring regardless of who's at fault.
1236,Very disappointed in DoorDash.
1236,I will be canceling my subscription.
177,"I usually use DoorDash, but I figured I'd try Grubhub, and boy was that a mistake."
177,"Instead of allowing me to cancel an order that was going to take over 2 hours to arrive, they offered a $10 voucher and claimed the order couldn't be canceled because the restaurant was already preparing it… Well Grubhub, that might be true, but who wants food that's been sitting around the restaurant for over 2 hours?"
177,DoorDash has this figured out.
177,Give them a call.
369,"I think it's past time for delivery services as well as the restaurants do away with the service fees, (to cover operating costs)."
369,Fake Covid is no longer an issue.
369,"If a restaurant is still having trouble keeping the doors open, they should close the doors!"
369,!
1046,After the last 6 months of watching the cost they charge for items increase while the actual cost stays the same I've decided that this service is just over the top ridiculously expensive.
1046,The service fees have become so high that it now costs almost double the cost of the items.
1046,This is before the tip comes into play.
1046,"Somehow the multiple ""service fees"" totaling as much as $10-$15 never makes its way to the drivers."
1046,"Postmate's ""greeded"" themselves out of a repeat customer."
698,Mod pizza had an option to add sauce on top of their pizza at the end just like in person if you were to order.
698,"But, they got rid of or don't have that option to add their previous sauces that they normally provide as options at the end in person via the app here."
698,"..It's late and I just wanted to have the same experience with options but I'm guessing due to complying with the chain's rules and updated regulations, I don't have those options anymore."
698,"..I think the chains should really come together and figure out geolocations where if you are in a certain town that will allow additional last sauce toppings, it should be more intuitive and allowed instead of a general overall consensus of the franchise decision to make every single pizza place comply with locational standards."
698,..Not fair to people that know the menu and then get cut on location regulations and restrictions.
394,All of a sudden I no longer find the black owned restaurants I order from on Grubhub.
394,They redirect me to  different restaurants which I have zero interest in trying.
394,I e seen this happen with over 6 restaurants I ordered from.
394,"After two orders, they magically stopped showing up or claim as closed!"
394,What the heck is going on?
1326,Doordash can actually be sooo convinent.
1326,"Whenever you don't have any transportation and you're really craving something, you can get it with a click of a button."
1326,The only complaint I have is the fees.
1326,"You are charged with delivery, tax, and tips."
1326,"If you say, "" you don't have to pay the tips tho"" you most definitely do."
1326,"Whenever I lesson my tip, my food comes completely messed up."
1326,The higher the tip the better quality food I receive.
1326,"I'd also like to add that whenever you do a smaller tip, people tend to decline your order."
1326,"So yeah, love and hate relationship!!"
1326,!
278,"Two nights in a row go to order food and the restaurant all of sudden says ""closed"" and can't complete order."
278,Restaurant is still open you should be able to order especially since I was picking up the food and not having it delivered.
278,Very frustrating when you go to pay and confirm order and have to start over!
662,"I think that it's a great app, but one thing that I think they could add that would make my experience a lot better in this app, is if they have a way to tell the restaurant that your ordering from like a custom note or a message, because sometimes there isn't a certain customization option...For example, if I want less ice in my drink because a restaurant puts way too much ice and that's not an option in the customization menu, then I should be able to write a note that says less ice."
662,They could already have that feature but idk where it is.
279,Driver picked up my food and drove around with it in her car for almost an hour before delivering it (the restaurant is less than 15 min away).
279,Food arrived completely inedible and I had to toss it.
279,GH would only refund $7 (I left a $4 tip).
279,"When I asked why they just said ""this is how we manage complaints."""
279,"Would give zero stars, have deleted my account."
399,The app is ok.
399,It's frustrating when I want to add more sauces from a place (for whatever cost) but I can't do that with the app.
399,If it had an option to add however many additional sauces then it would be great.
696,"Gives a list of places from which to order, you begin order, then when placing, it tells you restaurant is now closed."
696,Doesn't give a warning that it may close within 3 minutes of starting your order.
696,App is not stable and crashes.
696,"Found new restaurant, spent about 5-7 minutes placing order, went to check out and app was non responsive to the ""checkout"" button."
696,"You could add more things to your order or view info about the restaurant, but still couldn't complete the purchase."
696,"Restarted app and placed order all over, worked this time."
696,"Really sad considering the markup, and today's technological advances."
813,I recently placed an order at the Papa John's pizzeria near my house in doing so I received a notification that indicated that I could receive five dollars off my order my order total was at $23 note it said I need four more dollars to complete the five dollar transaction therefore I added $4.01 worth of sauces to my cart therefore gaining five dollars of free sauces I would highly recommend this app
156,You have a limited amount of refunds for your account  after which is where they just handed you off to another specialist and said you can't email or contact them so they have to email you within 7 to 10 business about the status change if not; if no response then I guess no refund or concession so be careful with the amount of refunds or reporting you do cause you know now to be mindful of reporting such things
165,I'm happy with everything but I will be watching my card account because sometimes someone charges my account for other restaurants so be careful and mindful I only do deliveries like this sometimes maybe once or twice a year.
561,Anytime I order off this something with my order is wrong.
561,Id say about 80% chance something wont be right.
561,Idk if its how the restaurants receive the orders or what.
561,"Lol I ordered a cheese pizza once… hahaha swear to god it came with dough, and cheese."
561,No sauce.
561,That wasnt even an option.
561,But some how i got… cheese bread in the shape of a pizza?
561,I order buffalo wild wing frequently.
561,Getting a wrap with wild sauce.
561,Usually comes as a wrap with either no sauce or regular.
561,Dont order the extra sauces like ranch or what ever from anywhere because it is a 50/50 youll get it.
561,Uber IS good at giving you the change back though.
561,"Again i dont THIIIINK its the restaurant, i dont ever blame a driver."
561,"But how the app is set up and reports orders, gottta be a problem."
561,But I do use it.
561,"Just WAY WAY less now, id rather call and order to go."
561,But at least the convenience is still available.
561,Just be prepared to have something wrong (usually just this or that wrong)
910,"There's something wrong with the tracking, whenever I'm watching the tracking process on the app, it will say my delivery driver is quite a distance from my location and then I will see that he's right outside my house."
910,"Also, I will have full Internet connection when this happens."
910,Is the app having a problem?
1021,Is a blind man I really enjoy having the option to have food that I want brought to my home.
1021,"Unfortunately, not everything on the app is a sasable with the Apple screen raider."
1021,Every time asked me to click a button and it does not tell me afterwards whether or not I have her have not clicked it even if I let it play through the entire audio script again.
1021,this makes it really complicated when it comes to check boxes in the app.
1021,"Otherwise I would ready to five star but since assessability is not yet there, I have to be honest and give it a three."
81,GrubHub gives you a guarantee that if you're not happy with the food or the food is late or cold you get your money back you refunded it doesn't really change the fact that when you're hungry you want to have something to write but at least you get a refund so if you're gonna order food I guess it's the best place to use Grubhub at your service
108,I only use Grubhub because my work gives me credit.
108,I have ordered it and been missing half of my meal 7 out of 10 times.
108,I just ordered a combo from Wendy's and I am missing my sandwich… my sandwich which is the main part of the order.
108,Is there no policy to check whether or not the food is in the bag before it gets delivered?!
108,There was no seal on the bag to show it wasn't opened by the driver.
108,Are the drivers take part or my order?
108,I don't have this issue near as much on Dash Dash.
108,I'm tried of waiting for my lunch just to not eat… and then having to complain for my refund…
331,Get local delivery from the merchant.
331,"All just randomly assigns people as quickly as possible and won't show they've cancelled until they have a ""new driver"" that may also cancel."
331,All this after already placing the order.
331,"It's like a game if ""will I ever get my food"" roulette...The end result is that the app owners bend over the users, drivers and stores; while holding zero accountability."
574,"I submitted a complaint after my beverage, the entire order, was spilled."
574,"I submitted a photo, and all I got told was that since I didn't send in a photo with my complaint, I won't get a refund for the driver spilling my drink."
574,"I told them I had, and I was confused by what they needed and they closed the conversation."
574,Here is the kicker:.I heard the driver filing a complaint with Uber after she spilled Ofer half of the drink on her seats...All Uber is concerned is cutting their losses.
574,"Out of the three orders to the same place I made that day, only two of them made it to my door, and only one wasn't spilled."
574,I think Uber needs to take a look ate their policies and I think they need to be more honest about just not wanting to give a refund.
823,It makes zero sense to allow a driver to cancel an order just because they cannot complete the delivery.
823,"The order should be allowed to be passed on to another driver instead of making the person order it wait 30 minutes, then cancelling the whole order and then having to redo the order just to wait another 30-45 minutes."
823,This order was placed for someone who just got home from the hospital and could not drive.
823,Drivers should not be allowed to cancel an entire order due to some issue on their part.
823,Do better Uber.
271,Texting services or calling services to the drivers no longer work.
271,They have not worked in months.
271,And the drivers can't contact us to get help finding our location.
271,What's the point?
271,"And then when you try to talk to somebody online, you get fake responses and they don't even read what the problem is."
271,They are completely useless.
1150,It's very frustrating to me that DoorDash drivers try to fit as many orders as they can in one run because that's how they get paid the best.
1150,"Tonight I ordered food that was supposed to be delivered at 7:12pm, but it didn't actually get delivered until 7:35pm."
1150,"I watched my driver go from the restaurant that had my food to a location 3 miles from me, to another location, back to the location 3 miles from me, to another place, and then finally to me all the while the driver had my food."
1150,I just think that DoorDash could do better about delivery time estimates.
1150,"I got a text from the app at 7:09pm saying ""your driver is close by"" so I went outside, but then I looked at my app and realized my driver was delivering other dashes nearby."
1150,I finally went back inside and waited for my driver to text me.
1150,"I don't blame the driver, I know they're doing their best and making money."
1150,I just wish the app would TELL me all of this before it confirms my order to be delivered at 7:12pm.
1150,I really think it's the fault of the app and people paying the drivers.
1150,It's in no way the drivers fault.
779,Used ubereats for a grocery delivery.
779,They delivered a box of rotten food with an expiration date of more than ten days away.
779,We opened the box two days later (when we actually needed it) and saw it was rotten WITH a smell which we couldn't see at delivery because the label covered the food- so we took photos of it.
779,Spent an hour texting support and getting no response on hold- then tracked down the number to call.
779,"They acknowledged it was rotten, but Ubereats wouldn't refund the money even with the photos because we didn't open the box for two days."
779,Use instacart instead- we never have this problem.
355,By then I usually don't have the money to order anything else till the refund go thru sometimes its right away and other times it take days I get off late and everything closed so very Leary to order if I'd late in the day like today but I'm going to try
994,I am literally flabbergasted at how quick and easy it is to use this app!
994,I was driving I had a craving for cocos Mediterranean and I clicked search and it came up popular item clicked on it literally a minute and by the time I get to my office my lunch will be ready!
994,You can't beat that
321,When you are disabled and can't drive it is a real treat to find this service and to get food from one of your favorite restauarants; Pizza Union San Marcos.
321,Thx again for the great service!!
321,!
1053,I've been ordering for Postmates for over two years.
1053,It really carried me through my pregnancy and the pandemic and they continue to have great service amazing drivers/carriers and I will continue to patronize them over other food delivery services and platforms.
202,"My Delivery driver walked up to me, I wasn't sure what he said, when I told him my name to confirm if it was my delivery he just got on his bike turned away and said the delivery was for a girl."
202,"These are the types of people GrubHub hires, how in the world would he know it was for a female and why didn't he stop and talk to me(the doorman) to try and figure out the proper address?"
202,"Instead he just drove away with my food, put my job at risk as I left my post to chase him down and caused me a lot of my time smh"
312,I'm currently under the weather with COVID-19.
312,I appreciate the contactless option as to getting the food I like while being in quarantine.
312,Thank you Cynthia (my delivery driver) much appreciated
332,The delivery drivers are professional and courteous.
332,I have used this app for approximately 3 years and loved it but the last 6 months or so have been terrible.
332,Constantly missing up to half my order each time I place an order.
332,Not sure if I'll be using this service anymore.
466,Grubhub is the best app I've ever used in my life compared to DoorDash and postmarks it even has the best delivery drivers and the best service keep up the amazing work
498,"I will definitely use this app often, delivery driver was on time, followed instructions."
498,Food was safely sealed and still warm.
162,I put in my order description every time that I live in a military post and once their at the gate and realize they can't get in everyone is surprised.
162,I had 5 orders cancelled because of that and 2 where back to back from different drivers.
162,I don't know if they look before they pick it up but it seems it doesn't bother them whatsoever keeping my food.
847,"Uber, I've been using your service for YEARS."
847,Since you came out with that first kinda sketchy app back in 2011ish.
847,Within the past 4-5 years the user interface has created an entirely toxic tipping culture.
847,"I do not, and will never tip before my order is delivered."
847,Tips are optional and percentage is based on the quality of work.
847,"It seems agents find it to be acceptable to not deliver orders when there is a low tip, or zero tip applied BEFORE it's delivered."
847,"It's wrong to ask a customer to tip before the order is delivered, it's almost as if you're suggesting it's required?"
847,Fix this please.
1048,I appreciate all the hard men and women who work to pick up and deliver food so I don't have to get up and leave my house when I don't feel like it after working a long week myself I appreciate y'all And thanks for all the people in the food industry thy make the delicious meals
961,Don't fall into the trap.
961,It can be convenient but continues to be unreliable.
961,An order received after 45 minutes the establishment is allowed to cancel the order with no reasoning nor repercussion.
961,"But the individual with a processed amount expecting a service to be executed since it was confirmed, is now left with nothing."
961,"Maybe instill harsher requirements on how the business can do whatever they want, when a customer gets charged for a cancellation, is that fair?"
194,"My son, 11 going on 25, lives almost an hour away (part-time) GrubHub gives me the ability to be SUPER MOM when he has cravings that only his Mama caters too, and he gets to feel like VIP first class when he makes a quick call, to me, and his food is otw!"
194,Love it!
939,I don't recommend nobody to download this app I use to like Uber but not anymore after they took my money they doing fraud they charge for order that you cancel n they would not refund you yo money back which that's so mess up I hate it never again y'all will not get money no more
111,Ordered food 1 day ahead to be delivered at a particular time and had it cancelled 1 hr before delivery time without any explanation.
111,That is irritating and a waste of my time.
111,Reordered from the same restaurant and had no issue with same-day ordering.
111,Grubhub needs to get its act together.
111,"At least give a proper explanation like ""someone messed up and didn't put your order in"" or something cause it's obviously not that I couldn't order from the restaurant since I did!"
111,Aggravating and time-wasting.
145,"I rather using  Uber eat , all this dose is not have canes and more places the worst part is that they choose to tell me it's close at 10 that's a big lie the whole grabhub choose to close it then self I don't see what the point of doing payments to a membership if y'all Fina be losing places in you're own pick of time there no point why he taking people money if y'all Fina be lying about the service we pay for keep in mine there people who literally have no transportation…!"
149,I'm So Glad I made the switch from dealing with Uber Eat and DoorDash!
149,After allowing DoorDash mess up 3 out of 4 recent orders.
149,The final canceling a order and telling me I have to wait 3 days for my refund to hit my account.
149,"When that was last $28, I'm glad to switch."
149,To reliable and timely service from Grubhub😙
1277,Functionally a fine app.
1277,"But note to Devs: when you go to pull up an old order that is VERY old and thus probably not archived anymore, it fails in an ugly way."
1277,"For example, rather than showing a page saying that there was an error, it shows a white screen with something that someone on the backend would want to see (""something goes wrong to fetch order with detail,…"")."
1277,"The message changes depending on the order, but if you click the same order over and over the message that is shown stays the same."
1277,Maybe something to fix for the next version?
222,I wish you could do a tip adjust on the app.
222,"I tip low because some drivers are horrible but once in a while I get an awesome driver, it would be nice to adjust that tip instead of having to have cash on hand to give them."
975,"Can't disable promotional notifications in the App's settings, resulting in constant spam of notifications."
975,Disabling them globally in ios settings is a poor work around because it limits app's core functionality.
975,All other major apps allow you to selectively disable notifications by type.
975,"But this app doesn't, making it spammy by design."
975,Apple app store should block these kinds of apps to protect the quality of the ecosystem.
975,There are better alternatives to this app.
1091,But worth it.
1091,"It's been easier to order from Postmates, and we personally like Uber."
1091,"The competition may be cheaper, but Postmates makes it happen with ease."
1091,"Rock on with your bad selves, Postmates!"
211,We order on an iPad.
211,When we order too many line items it won't allow us to scroll to the bottom.
211,"We have to delete an item or 2 in order to verify what's not visible on the screen, then go back and increase/add items."
380,"My order was already going to be delivered late, switched several drivers before being cancelled."
380,Waited almost an hour and a half before not even getting my food.
380,Then their offering was $5 off next order which is what I already used on the one that got cancelled.
380,Pretty pathetic solution if you ask me
881,Twice out of six times I have gotten a wrong order   Once by ihop where I was given 20 dollars off next order.
881,I used five dollars and the rest was taken off my account   Just today at best burger I got s hamburger with out s bun.
881,How could that happen on accident.
881,These people in these restaurants should be fired for this
487,Great app they get back to when there's a problem Great prices I recommend this over any delivery app
843,"I just received an order and the tacos were so cold I'm not sure anything, including the chicken, was cooked."
843,The rest of my order was properly heated.
843,There's no option to talk to someone.
843,"When I put in a complaint it was ‘thanks for your feedback, even though this can't be refunded'."
843,I got $8 worth of tacos that I don't think are safe to eat.
843,So I won't eat them.
843,Literally the ‘not safe to eat' report won't refund you.
843,"They asked for a photo of the food as if you can see how cold it is in the photo 😂 to be fair, idk if the chicken is undercooked."
843,But I'm not risking another bite.
277,Why give customers options if you're going to do whatever you want anyway.
277,If I wanted my food sitting outside unattended I would have asked for it to be left I unattended.
277,How hard is it anyway to knock on a door/ring the doorbell.
277,It's a simple request why is so hard to get right?
685,This is the worst design for a food service app … im constantly having my orders delayed to the point where i can no longer get the meal i order over an hour ago.
685,I was hungry back when i ordered so you can bet after waiting an hour and 40 minutes im much hungrier than before.
685,Now for regular orders that are just late but still fulfilled you expect me to enjoy?
685,i had to wait forever for cold/soggy food?
685,"why is the restaurant preparing this food immediately after accepting the order, they shouldn't be making the food until a driver has confirmed they will deliver it… that food sits out for over an hour before it gets to me… that's barely safe/healthy depending on what it is… rework this entire app, get a new strategy."
435,"Love this app, I like being able to find the specials."
435,Keeps me saving money and trying new restaurants.
1023,"(Remember look at the comments not the Stars).Honestly this app is the worst app to order food from always getting wrong order of foods, and when i try too resolve the issue the workers on the chat are so unprofessional, never want to get a refund when order take 1hr long when they advertised it well only be 20 to 30mins and without warning they well have your order delayed and not tell you , honestly if you feel like you wanna go thru a hassle and a hour wait for food then i wouldn't recommend this app to anyone , and now I understand why they dont refund anymore on order their fault now cause so many screw up with this app now."
875,"When your browsing, they say delivery in 35 minutes, then once you order, they say 1 hour, but if you read the gray colored fine print, they say latest delivery by 1.5 hours."
875,So they triple the advertised delivery time and tell you that only after you've already placed the orders .
875,That's deceitful
1070,Don't bother.
1070,They will push your delivery time back for hours while their drivers cancel for no reason.
1070,I live in a major city (Nashville) so there is definitely no shortage of drivers.
1070,No one ever responds to your chats (been waiting on hold for over 15 minutes) I will never order from them again and neither should you.
1070,"Don't bother unless you're willing to wait 3 hours for a cold, subpar meal delivered by incompetent drivers."
688,I definitely would not recommend this app.
688,I'm going elsewhere.
688,"I literally ordered curry goat from a Jamaican restaurant yesterday, they sent me curry chicken."
688,I called the restaurant and the restaurant said they were calling Uber to give me a credit because they realize they made a mistake.
688,Uber will not give me a refund because I previously reported another restaurant for not giving me the correct order as well as another for having here and my food which I always provide evidence.
688,"So because other restaurants make a mistake, I have to be penalized for it?"
688,"pretty much, they stole my money!"
688,"gave me something that I didn't ask for and said sorry lol I'm deactivating my account, and there is no promotion that they can give me to make me come back."
376,"Four stars, because I wish that when restaurants did there own delivery I could track their progress to my door."
357,Great way to get food brought directly to you!
357,"Always fast, always friendly, always on point!"
495,Self explanatory.
495,Can't fulfill an order?
495,That's fine!
495,Waiting 2 hours to tell me about it?
495,Not fine!
495,"..It's almost like every restaurant is now closed and I can't get food, and maybe I would have if I wasn't waiting for your service."
495,..Your company is a joke.
495,Back to Doordash I go:)
892,I was happy to stay home and order through the app being that I'm pregnant and don't want to drive out to get food.
892,I ordered food and tracked the driver ride around my neighborhood then leave and wrote me delivered.
892,No sign of food anywhere.
892,The dumb driver took off with my food and I was so hungry.
892,I don't even think the drivers get penalized for that.
892,That's theft and I normally don't wish people bad but I'm pregnant so I hope as his days continue serving people may he get all the Karma coming his way.
1183,"Why can't I rate my restaurant and driver outside of the pop up that disappears from swiping out of the app, getting a battery notification, etc?"
1183,"If for any reason I'm trying to get to another part of the app when the opportunity to rate pops up, I'm probably going to thoughtlessly tap past it, and be left unable to voice my opinion on what I just ate, good or bad."
1183,This has needlessly soured my mood from not being able to endorse a great meal and feeling some pent up appreciation that has nowhere productive to go.
1183,Uber let's you increase the tip part way through the delivery.
1183,"Sure, it would just add anxiety to feeling like you need to tip more based on how long your order is taking, and it's probably good that DoorDash has ways of differentiating itself from others, but that's just another quality of life improvement that feels like it's missing from the app."
365,Never using this app again fr.
365,I needed a refund 3x and I didn't get it.
365,Those 3 times they didn't get my order right.
365,No refund.
365,If the driver is late?
365,No refund of course the food is going to be cold; don't even want the food anymore.
1092,"I think there could be more strict rules that need to be followed to ensure the correct order is being sent out, the food modification options are being followed and communication about such is happening so people can choose to cancel if they don't fulfill the order"
392,I have a huge problem with drivers leaving my drinks and kids meals out.
392,Which is pretty much the sole purpose of me ordering food to make them happy and I can't even manage that by using this app.
392,So I'm out the money on those items and I gotta go spent the money again and go get it myself.
1313,I'd love to rate this app a 5 star as it's good and I appreciate the ability to have food delivered to me.
1313,"However, I continue to get the wrong orders from the restaurants I buy from and because I've had too many in the past they've now declined to compensate me in return for not getting what I asked for."
1313,It makes no sense why I am being penalized for the operations mistake.
1313,I get that it could be seen as suspicious but when I have the wrong order I am going to say so.
1313,I wish there was a way to connect to the store itself and resolve disputes as it would be much easier.
436,"I don't know what's wrong with them lately, but I seem to NEVER get my whole order recently."
436,"..I ordered for my family and only received food for one or two, leaving the rest of the family with no food."
436,When I contact the drivers I'm told that's all they were given.
436,So either the drivers are stealing the food or the restaurants aren't getting the full orders.
436,"I'm betting that Grubhub isn't getting the full orders to the restaurant, otherwise how is a $70 order only two small food items?..They offered a refund, but what I want is what I paid for."
436,..Do not recommend using.
803,"This app is really really good, don't get me wrong though one incident happened and I felt really disappointed."
803,My driver canceled like 15 times in a spam of an hour.
803,Right after my whole order was canceled basically loosing money + the tip and my food I was angry I had wasted about 40 dollars on food for my family.
803,I sent a complaint and nothing was done.
803,But asides from that is a good app
258,"There was an issue with the delivery, and I got somebody responding with canned responses, probably from another country, and all it did was make me more irritated."
258,"Have used many of these apps, and this one may have the worst customer experience as it doesn't allow me to control notifications, intuitively, or communicate with anyone that can actually talk to me."
334,If delivered with Grubhub all good need to be specifically sealed with label at store while it's delivered because we feel that all delivery is not the same because of Covid and need pictures send from when they pick up also for better customer experience and company may have upper hand.
360,Wouldn't bother using this service.
360,They don't hire drivers that have any common sense.
360,"They have drivers who deliver their own orders instead of urs, then call back telling you the drivers outside and wants to know if you have their order."
360,"Just really unprofessional, on top of the fact they dunno what they're doing half the time."
360,Will not use them again.
1154,It's really inconvenient when your told one thing by a dasher or rep on the phone and there is not upper management to oversee the issues.
1154,My daughter order food and when she noticed the order went to my brothers address she called to change the address.
1154,They stated she could not change the address which was fine.
1154,But they advised her they would cancel the order and she would receive a refund.
1154,After a week and no refund I called.
1154,They state that since the order was cancelled and the food was picked up that she would not receive her 42$ back.
1154,My brother verified that the dasher never delivered the order.
1154,So you mean to tell me she loses 42$ and the dasher just got free Chick-fil-A?
1154,"That's doesn't seem right, they should still be required to deliver the order to the address listed because I would have driven to get it."
1154,"It has now been 3 weeks, after calling in 3 times and still not receiving a call back in 24 hrs as I was told, we are done with DoorDash."
1154,Deleted my app and don't plan on using it ever again.
1154,You just stole 42$ from my daughter who ordered Chick-fil-A for her and her friends at a sleep over for her birthday.
1154,Congrats!
1154,!
316,This is my first order in some years as well as in a new city and the first one was great!
316,Let's keep striving for all 5 stars!
450,I'm not sure how but got completely banned from DoorDash.
450,Tried this.
450,Just got my first order pretty well done pretty cheap.
891,"For homes that maybe hard to find, the problem could be solved easily by adding PHOTOS to driving instructions… Please consider that some drivers don't actually read to comprehend and they just go by what they see when they arrive."
891,I live near 3 communities and drivers ALWAYS choose the wrong one and I'm always getting calls from the driver and Uber… but there are NO solutions from Uber.
891,..Fix your app.
891,Add photos.
54,"I take orders that are called into our business, and no one has ever told me I'm bad at what I do."
54,"However, the person taking the order just today had a mild accent, so I had to ask if she could repeat a particular item."
54,"Why aren't you familiar with the menu, the lady replies in a harsh manner."
54,I once expressed regret to her for not hearing what she had to say.
54,"Instead of politely repeating the phrase back, this woman continues to blast the phrase at me."
54,"Additionally, even if it doesn't concern me, every time someone cancels an order on Grubhub, the business does not opt to at the very least phone the restaurant to inform them that the order has been canceled."
54,"As a result, the restaurant wastes food as well as time and money."
54,I anticipate more from a firm that size.
87,"I placed an order at a restaurant more than an hour before they closed, and then received a message that my order was being prepared."
87,"15 minutes before my order was supposed to be delivered they cancelled my order, saying it was because the restaurant was closing."
87,"But, I sent my order well in advance of them closing, and it should have been easy to fulfill my order on time."
87,"Then they call and say only that I was refunded, but there's no recourse for the fact that despite putting in my order early and waiting 45 minutes, they didn't get there on time to place my order before the restaurant's closing."
1322,App had been lagging a lot for me recently.
1322,Starts off at the bugging of my dashes just fine but a while it it starts to get bogged down with something cause all interactions in the app to before delayed by several seconds each.
1322,"This makes it hard to accept dashes, turn by turn navigation a, marking dashes as done and completing photos and then close out that dash."
1322,..Really need to figure out what's going on ther as it has persisted through several app updates and it's still going.
1322,"..Please also update the app so we can utilize the new ""live activities"" Apple has rolled out."
1322,This have get us in screen navigation better and the ability to accept or decline new orders
1031,The performance of the app itself is phenomenal.
1031,No issues with stuttering or anything of the such.
1031,The frustration lies with drivers keeping your order hostage when they're not even moving.
1031,"It takes a while before the app decides to drop a driver off of your order and by that time, you've already decided to just cancel the order completely instead of waiting for the app to reassign a driver."
1097,The first delivery the driver did not knock on the door and we had no idea our order had arrived.
1097,Cold coffee..The second order time or order was cancelled because the store was apparently out of something included in our order.
