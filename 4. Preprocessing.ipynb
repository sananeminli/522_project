      "Today is Monday, September 26, 2022, and this is the second time that I have had an issue with GrubHub delivery. I‚Äôve been tracking this driver and he or she has been driving around in my neighborhood and didn‚Äôt even bother to  get to my address so therefore I felt that my food would‚Äôve  been cold upon arrival and now it was abruptly cancelled, so now I am re-ordering once  again.üò° I am a senior citizen and I am disabled, the name of the complex is Mayflower Gardens Senior Apartments. I wished that the driver would keep in mind that some of us older customers are not as quick to get to the door and we are not dumb or stupid. I know know how to read apps, and I know my directions,when they come, and some of them in the past will abruptly leave your order at the door on the ground and not even bother to knock. I am requesting a re-order once again because I have tracked the last driver and he or she was in my neighborhood and I‚Äôm not sure if they were lost or not but it would be nice if they were use the GPS system more effectively so that they can find my address. Please know that  is why I am really hesitant to order with you in the near future if this continues to happen. Needless to say I am not happy at this time.I noticed that a female driver will be delivering my order shortly and I hope that it‚Äôll arrive in time.\n"

       " 'i love using uber eats especially when i cannot get out or just do not want to cook the only problem i have had is i have paid the extra fee for priority to be delivered straight to me and still waited past the wait time a lot of the time i waited past the wait time so paying for priority is pointless to me',\n",
       " 'why is it only 4 addresses it makes no sense i work in more than 3 different places and i often visit my family so i need to add more addresses also you should allow the user to save as 2 diff addresses eg one for day delivery and another one for evening delivery because the access doors can vary even if it is the same building it is amazing you have not contemplated this basic need yet',\n",
       " 'i honestly do not understand how is it that i do not receive my food and you still charge me the money that i spent for the food that i should have received and then not give me my refund your policy is absurd and the fact that you stole my money it is upsetting i used to order from this app and i even did the deliveries myself now that you showed your true face i will no longer use your service nor will i work with a bunch of thieves if i could i would give you guys 20 stars',\n",
       " 'spent two hours disputing an increase from an original estimate of 30  to a final delivery of 100  with 3 substitutions  one of the items substituted was feta with a sticker price of 8 dollars which appeared to become an 18 dollar item  even though item does not come up when you search for it  and non of the items cost as much in uber after talking for 2 hours with support and them telling me  that they can charge what ever they want and not provide an itemized receipt that would show how the coast of my order increased by 70 not responding uber one employee shivan gupta started to teach me about fairness and in the end completely ignored my questions and stopped responding at all so it was my final experience with the platform and how lovely was it especially after paying a 10 fee for such a privilege great experience',\n",
       " 'when i am starving and cannot find anything open it is always sherrys the food is good and most times it is always hot and delicious i do not know what you are waiting for order something you you will be happy that you did',\n",
       " 'what would you like outrageous prices slow deliveries your delivery driver dropping off someone elses food when it would have been faster to drop off your food first cancelled orders constantly well if you had like all of the above download this app and watch your 10 dollar order turn into a 21 dollar order get doordash or grubhub because this app is a true money grab currently waiting on my food that is been on the move for an hour i live 12 min from the restaurant i ordered from',\n",
       " 'the customer service here is a joke my order was cancelled by uber eats because the driver could not find my house the driver called me to help find the place and i gave her the best instructions i could she told me she is going to call uber and hung up the phone shortly after my order was cancelled and uber said they were going to give me a refund i waited and the refund never came i called uber and they said because it is been 48 hours they could not issue a refund never got my food and they will not give me my money back',\n",
       " 'pay for priority deliver that says 2535 minutes and took an hour and a half refund nope there should be a test for every uber driver to make sure they know how to drive in the city these people and i do not mean the drivers only app makers as well do not know how to navigate the city i will watch my delivery and they will take side streets instead of the freeway a 15 minute drive will take them 35 minutes cause the drivers follow the stupid navigation app given to them instead of driving the fastest route garbage',\n",
       " 'i have had it for two months after years of using doordash i have had constant issues like orders being an hour or more late multiple times my order today was missing over half of the items uber eats does not care at all when there is an issue with doordash like this they give you a credit or refund your entire order to make up for the inconvenience i highly recommend utilizing any other delivery service besides uber eats',\n",
       " 'i am literally flabbergasted at how quick and easy it is to use this app i was driving i had a craving for cocos mediterranean and i clicked search and it came up popular item clicked on it literally a minute and by the time i get to my office my lunch will be ready you cannot beat that',\n",
       " 'this is not beneficial i want to save money with small orders yet the orders are still high even with uber one i have to spend over 20 to apply the promo and despite that my order is still high because the promo does nothing to reduce the price i applied for uber one expecting the first month to be free as they advertised yet i was charged 5 on my card after applying this is useless i am an unsatisfied customer',\n",
       " 'i used to enjoy this app as a college student but the last food order i had came ice cold and uber did not do anything to fix the problem the order i currently have was promised by 945 as an uberone member but all of a sudden they changed it to 1015 without keeping their promise of gifting 5 if it came after 945 this has gotten annoying and i cannot afford to spend this amount of money on poor quality serviceplanning',\n",
       " 'i drive a truck and cannot get the truck into a lot of places so it is nice having this service but sometimes the food is terrible but that is the restaurants fault i guess someone pay off the order is missing but that is probably the restaurant too',\n",
       " 'use uber eats like every other week but get multiple promo notifications every dayit is really annoying i cannot disable it  i can turn off notifications but then i cannot get updates of my deliveries gonna give it another week if it continues gonna delete the app and switch to grubhub or something  might be less selection in my area but at least i do not get these annoying notifications all day',\n",
       " 'i have only ever been able to use this app in bigger cities and 810 times the driver will steal one of the items from my order or the restaurant will get it wrong even though i directly put what i wanted in said orderthe app sends constant unnecessary notifications most about how they added more new locations however for 4 years they have not and will not deliver to my home location',\n",
