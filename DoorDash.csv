2022-12-13 12:55:30,"Giving one star because doordash has been my go to for a few years now, and when we have issues with the food they were really good at fixing the issue. I don’t blame them for the crappy food that these restaurants are serving but I do expect them to at least fix the problem when there is one. Last night I got a complete wrong order, showed the receipt in the messages so that we could at the very least get the food replaced. Didn’t open it, even offered to give it back. Or have a credit or refund. They chose to say we had did this before and there was nothing they could do. Which is ridiculous cause we have only complained one other time about this restaurant. A year ago, at that!! But also who doesn’t complain when the order is completely wrong or missing items, which has been very often lately which is why we started to use it less. And then when I think just maybe, just maybe my order will be correct, this happens. Do we just accept it even though we spent our money on it?!?!? Like I’m sorry but that’s not something I’m doing. I would rather have the food replaced than to receive the money but apparently they don’t like doing that either. So my family, friends and I have chosen to delete out accounts and go with another service. You should be ashamed of yourselves. Even tried speaking with a supervisor but still the same results. Be cautious using this app because they don’t like to do what’s right!!! Very disappointing DOORDASH! Do better!!",1,False,HIGHCEE011,Used to love this service!!,doordash,719972451

Thankfully door dash gave us back our money but not to our bank account but as credit on their app. For the first time ordering I can say it definitely was a sucky experience! But I like their quick response. Our door also has light and cameras. Unfortunately the next driver placed the bag of food so close to the door that I couldn’t open it without it rolling down the steps and she seen me (the passenger) struggle and still drove off. She literally could of got out and helped but I guess she waited for me to say help when I looked up to say help she already was driving away. Tho I would of not waited for someone to say help and offered it, I still feel this was a better driver than the OTM which I found out means “On The Move” meaning someone making moves being sneaky and they sure was and got away with it. Other than those two experiences I’m ok with giving the app another try. I’m in Philly PA so people out here going to try to take advantage the best way they know how and think they entitled to it smh I just wish there was a way to protect us from people like this who they hire..

2022-12-10 00:11:50,"I have been using DoorDash for a while now and it’s only getting worse. Not only is the food a lot more expensive using the app, but the drivers never follow the instructions at all. I have specific instructions for both home and office and in neither location do they ever read the instructions. On top of that, half of the drivers can’t speak, or read English, so it doesn’t matter if I write instructions on where to leave the food. The last time I ordered food, it was for my office, and it explicitly stated to walk inside the building and hand it to me or put it on the front desk. Instead, the driver went to the totally wrong door and left the food outside in the cold and rain. On top of that, there is no way to adjust the tip or to conveniently take away the tip when they failed to do their job appropriately. I’m sorry, but I do not feel I should have to tip a person for not doing an appropriate job in the first place. If they can’t do their job, they don’t deserve tip. This is coming from a person who worked in the service industry for a very long time. There was even one time, when I ordered my food, and the driver brought me the completely wrong order. Since it was later in the evening, I was not able to have the food order corrected. DoorDash did refund me my money, but I was still screwed on food for that night.

2022-11-07 04:36:03,"I have been both a consumer and dasher and it’s very convenient for a consumer if you are willing to pay the extra fee but it’s also hard to tip so much extra for the dasher to make it worth while. As a previous dasher I know that it is hard to even call it a side hustle. Most consumers are reluctant to leave a tip and when they do it’s minimal, but I understand as a consumer that it’s hard to pay a big tip when you order something and the price is twice as much as item you paid for just because door dash charges extra. Then you have you tile the driver because trust be they don’t make much without a tip. Please tip big for these dashers if they do a good job so there is more value in it. Remember, door dah doesn’t pay for gas, insurance, maintenance or anything. Yes dashers get a tax write off but it’s not exactly the same. 

Also, if you are a dasher you may want to try instacart instead if it is popular in your city. Especially in the winter. It’s pays better and it keeps you more active throughout the day. I made way more doing instacart when I was trying both. Around $20 and hour. Again you are an independent contractor so you can get write offs.

2022-11-13 12:09:58,I’ve used DoorDash quite frequently over the past two years. However lately it seems I’m having more more issues with my food not being delivered to the correct address or Dashers picking up other orders and my food getting here extremely late. That has even happened when I’ve ordered things such as ice cream. I think the worst part about it is that some of these Dashers do not respond to your calls or messages. I could easily direct them to my house which is not at all difficult to find. GPS takes anyone directly to my driveway which is only 15 feet long. for a long time my orders often came without the drinks. Therefore I stopped ordering drinks. But now there seems to be issues more and more. The worst part is often times I only get partial refunds when a delivery does not go well. Or when the delivery is delivered to an entirely different place I get offered to have it re-delivered. But then the new Dasher ended up still picking up somebody else’s order before mine and then came to my neighborhood with blaring music that caused some of my neighbors to step outside. Very embarrassing. I was afraid to even complain about the loud music as this person obviously knows where I live. All these issues coupled with the high prices make this no longer worth the trouble. therefore I have deleted the app and will no longer be using.,2,False,AS in VA,Sick of delivery issues,doordash,719972451
2022-11-17 19:01:32,"I’ve had doordash for a couple of years now, but over the past couple of months it has become an incredibly frustrating experience. When I order food for delivery, many times they’ll have more than one other person to deliver before me, so I get cold food when it arrives even when the driver has thermal equipment to keep the food in. When I order for pick up, the app gets incredibly confusing. It constantly suggest locations to me that are not the closest, and the address for the place doesn’t even show up until the check out. And then I go to my usual location thinking it’s fine since I’ve order from those places many times before only to find out it’s a whole other location I’ve never been to. There are no warnings or anything to tell you this isn’t the closest location when you’re ordering, and if it’s frustrating for a person that is used to apps, I can’t imagine how infuriating it would be for more technologically challenged people. On top of that, when restaurants have gotten my orders wrong, I’m only given a partial refund for my order even though I now have a meal I can’t eat. I originally got this app because it was cheaper than uber eats with decent service, but now the prices are about the same so I don’t see a point anymore.

2022-11-11 22:56:53,"Honestly used to love DoorDash. I’m going to give it a 2 because it was recently at a 1. The only reason for that is 1 star for the restaurants because they always make the food on point and it’s usually never them. The second star is because Door Dash used to be good. But what in the world has been going on with the past deliveries. 
Every delivery that I have placed in the past 2-3 months has been so terrible and it’s been about 6 times. This is definitely my last as I’m currently waiting AGAIN for more than 1 hour for my food all because of other deliveries. 
What’s the point of ordering food and calling yourself door dash if you aren’t going to be either of those things? 
The food has been taking at least 2 hours every time to be delivered. The longest I’ve waited was 2 hours and 45 minutes!!! 
I’m not sure if it’s the drivers or door dash but I do not want to return as a customer because this is simply ridiculous. They pass right by your house. It’s not even like they go to a spot down the block, you see them jumping on high way and are stuck where it is they probably have went. Oh and then when you ask, half the time they never respond.

In my experience to recent events deliveries have been miss delivered to wrong complexes or apartments. Due to this issue i’ve had re-ordered, sometimes repeating the miss delivery. However, some dashers call the customers to make sure the order is in your possession by the correct building, floor and apt. In my last order DoorDash has miss delivered and denied any sort of refund or help. In contacting support, all I’m told is that they cannot process any sort of “transaction and there’s nothing they can do for me” However there is many things that can be done. Such as a photo of the door with the food and apt #. Then, I’d at least know where to find my order, but they rather say they can’t offer me money as the first and only solution leaving a sour taste in my mouth and a distrust in what they think of me and letting me know they see me as a dishonest customer or that my issues are below them. Id hope they reinforce dashers to check customer notes for delivery help.

The day we needed it to be delivered,I finalize the order first thing in the morning. The date and time I preset was noon on that particular day. When I closed the order, it sent it to the restaurant and dasher immediately.  It was delivered within 30 minutes - 2 1/2 hours before our scheduled lunch meeting time and before the time I entered when I set up the pre-scheduled delivery. If the app is not going to remember a pre-scheduled delivery time, don’t make that an option. It risks food spoilage.  

Experience from last year:  DoorDash works out great when it works out. However, the instructions for placing group orders are nebulous and not all restaurants have a group order link but it doesn’t really say why. Also didn’t know that a restaurant we tried to order with had $100 max. Would’ve been nice to know that before I entered $176 worth of items. Had to go back to the team to reassess who wanted what.

I mean the restaurant is 15 minutes away.  They could have delivered and returned to the restaurant easily enough.  While I appreciated the response from the dasher, it was completely opposite everything the customer service rep was telling me.

It’s ridiculous to ask the customer to pay extra to solve the problem you created. Numerous times I’ve gotten cold food regardless of how good the driver is. Sometimes the nearby customer won’t come to their door, or the “nearby order” isn’t nearby at all. If it wasn’t for the fact that I enjoy hot food, this wouldn’t be a problem, I can wait a little longer for my food, but it gets cold. Without this feature I would give DoorDash five stars as a customer, until then it’s two. I assume the multiple orders feature was only added to appease the dashers who weren’t being payed properly. But maybe instead of putting that onto the customer you just pay your dashers fairly.

I would say maybe 1 in every 5 orders has either a missing or incorrect item—no big deal. These little mistakes happen all the time when you go to a restaurant.
However, apparently after a few orders with missing items, they stop refunding for the missing items—and support chat will just keep disconnecting you before you can figure out what’s going on. I don’t mind the little mistakes on orders, they’re most likely not DD’s fault. But SUPPORT trying to shrug me off so that they don’t have to tell me I’m not getting a refund for food I paid for but didn’t receive was infuriating. I think I went through 8 different representatives before we got to our conclusion. And for the record, I wasn’t swearing or harassing, nothing like that, just patiently trying to figure out what was going on.

Hey, I wish that my orders weren’t frequently missing items too. But cutting me off from being refunded for incorrect orders, without an option for appeal, or to provide pictures—anything—that’s unacceptable. Like half my order wasn’t in the bag this time.

The 54$ meal it would have cost to pick up became nearly 100$ meal.

Maybe if you pay enough in tip your food is actually hot.  (Drivers typically want 50% of the subtotal regardless of distance or size of order)

But if you pay for dashpass everything changes.  Every driver takes multiple orders and yours is last regardless of what you tip.  On top of that, more times than not, you’ll get the wrong order or missing items.  Or your driver will spill your drinks and blame the drink carrier.

And what does support do?  DoorDash Credits.  They might tell you they’ll refund your payment method.  But you’ll still only get credits back, only useable on DoorDash.  

So if they mess up enough the only way to get your money back is to order again.  And it’s going to get just as messed up.  

Besides all of this the prices are entirely wrong for everything.  For every single available item you pay an up charge on the initial price.

But unfortunately, my recent experience has been abysmal. May be they don’t care Saphire preferred subscribers as much as the normal dashpass subscribers as I see a change in their behavior since I moved to this new subscription. 

I ordered food the other day, the dasher arrived half an hour later than originally estimated doordash time and then he tried to hand over food which was clearly not mine. He informed me that the food vendor hasn’t provided any receipt as well. I rejected the food saying that it’s not the food I ordered and immediately contacted the support. That took a wild turn where I started getting bizzare replies like we will get back to you in 24 hours. They literally left me hungry and had to get food elsewhere. 

Later I got a strange email saying “exceeded recent compensations”. I personally never asked me to compensate for anything before. The worst thing is there was absolutely no investigation as what happened to my order. In any case, I didn’t get my food and I lost my money. I’m gutted.",1,False,gmiryala,They literally stole my money.,doordash,719972451
2022-10-10 12:24:04,"I never leave reviews on apps. I switched to door dash because i was having issues with uber eats and thought i’d give it a try. i have had a few recent issue with my orders—like items not arriving that i reported. No issue arose. then a meal completely didn’t show up ~60$ paid and i reported it and they stated they can’t refund because they don’t have to “it’s stated in the fine print”. Because i had reported “too many issues recently” (not to any fault of my own) they will not issue a refund. 

basically theft for no service . im shocked. ordering with no guarantees of food but definitely guarantee of spending monday. despite the set backs i had with uber eats they always made sure they addressed issues that arose.",1,False,Hal121245,beware no food arrived but no refund,doordash,719972451

Significantly more expensive than calling in an order.   Prices are increased + fees.  Ultimately I deleted my account due to the lack of issue resolution as many drivers leave food outside or missing items.  There is a particularly large issue where most restaurants don’t list there condiments so even if you call and request them they will often not arrive with your meal.",3,False,minimalist tech,Expensive and Souless,doordash,719972451

Other times drivers will leave food at the completely wrong location. Most recently the driver texted me to say the restaurant never got the order and I have to cancel and retry.

From the users perspective it’s pretty clear: here’s my order, here’s the money, please bring it to my location. On the backend, it’s an absolute disaster of restaurants and drivers getting paid way too little to put any effort in, and the result is something goes wrong.

Order directly from the restaurant when you can. Pick it up yourself when you can. Use doordash as a last result and keep your expectations low.",1,False,ITested this for ya,Never goes as planned,doordash,719972451

This might not be an issue for people who have endless time, because that’s what you need to get through their gauntlet of employees all telling you the same few lines of how sorry they are. Honestly, I’ve discovered it’s best to just accept whatever automated deal they offer because that’s all their going to give even after a 2 hour text conversation. 

Not to mention they did NOTHING when I was verbally harassed by one of their drivers. I’m sure he’s still out driving and threatening even more customers.

2022-09-11 12:34:11,The app is only good for delivering food and the food at most times isn’t even worth it which has nothing to do with the app itself but this app is so money hungry and greedy that If you do have a mistake with your order or your DoorDasher is unavailable to complete it u can only get a refund in tips and not the full price. Also I just accidentally spent $96 on a yearly subscription that I now have to use because I cannot contact them to get a refund or switch it to the monthly subscription like I wanted it . I honestly hate this app at this point and have had many many issues with it I do not recommend it to anyone anymore and I can’t wait for my subscription to be up so I never have to use it again!,1,False,trtlani,HORRIBLE experience !!,doordash,719972451

It took another 20 minutes to be notified that they didn’t have a dasher in the area. Probably something you should have before you allow someone to put in the order. Another 40 minutes go by and I get informed that they can’t process my order at all because breakfast time was over. All I got from the customer service was that my order was cancelled.

There’s not going to be a next time. 

The app works fine. The service is the issue. DoorDash let’s it’s drivers take on multiple deliveries at once, so it’s not uncommon for your food to ride around in the driver’s vehicle for 20-30 minutes. By the time it arrives, it’s lukewarm at best. Also, you need to make it to where the customer can tip the driver AFTER delivery. Tipping beforehand based on the hope that your food will arrive is NOT gratuity.",1,False,Gemini92896,Cold Food,doordash,719972451

I placed a big order today through the restaurant online delivery service and when I received my food and opened my containers the delivery driver put it upon himself to eat my food and leave the scraps in the containers and still delivered it to me and took my tips. I contacted the restaurant first and then contacted door dash and the door dash customer service department said that he would put a ticket in with the restaurant to refund my money which right there I have an issue with because it wasn’t the restaurant’s fault that door dash delivery guy DeRon W. Of Indianapolis Indiana decided to eat my food and he said well we will put it in for him to never deliver to your address again HE SHOULDNT EVEN BE DELIVERING TO ANYONES ADDRESS,1,False,calimal2017,Horrible experience!,doordash,719972451

Also I have entered my ID into the app and verified that is correct multiple times. Still every single alcohol order ends up taking the delivery person ages to enter and half the time the app crashes on them halfway through and they have to start over. 
So basically I end up paying twice the delivery fees and watch a complete stranger take every bit of information from my ID which is already loaded into the app every time an order involves alcohol.

Not to mention they not only charge extra fees, but also raise the price you see on the menu from the actual price the restaurant charges.

From the dashers themselves, the inflated priced on items (even if you purchase their ‘dash pass’), the inaccurate map- to them not holding their Dasher’s accountable for marking orders “waiting for order” where then half way across the city or doing multiple deliveries when they’ve marked as your ordering being close by. It’s infuriating. Orders always show up cold, and half heartedly delivered. It’s difficult to support a business that doesn’t hold their employees accountable.
